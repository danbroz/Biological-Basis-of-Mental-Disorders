      "abstract": "Neurologic complications of acute alcohol intake are less well known to the general practitioner than those punctuating the course of chronic alcohol dependency. The state of ebriety is a poor incentive to precise neurologic analysis and follow-up. Nevertheless, only such surveillance in acute intoxication can distinguish a specific neurological complication, a complication following a fall or prolonged immobilisation, or rapid decompensation of alcoholic encephalopathy. Among the specific complications, myopathies and strokes are described here because of their rarity compared to the more common epilepsy and withdrawal syndromes. The neurologic semiology of ebriety is reviewed, including recent pathophysiological acquisitions specifying the mechanism of functional disorders in regions susceptible to alcohol such as the cerebellum and the reticular formation.",

      "title": "Cognitive Effects and Sedation",
      "abstract": "Cognitive effects and sedation (CES) are prevalent in chronic nonmalignant pain populations receiving long-term opioid therapy and are among the most common reasons patients discontinue opioid use. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, epidemiology, mechanisms, assessment, and management of opioid-related CES. We reviewed the empirical and theoretical literature on CES in opioid-treated populations with chronic pain. Data on long-term opioid therapy (≥3 months in duration) in chronic nonmalignant pain patients were sought. The phenomenology of CES includes: inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, psychomotor dysfunction, perceptual distortions, and executive dysfunction and somnolence, sleep disorders, and lethargy. Deficits may be caused by unrelieved pain or opioid therapy alone, or from a combination of these and other factors. Mechanisms include central nervous system effects, for example, direct toxic effects on neurons resulting in decreased consciousness; direct effects on processing and reaction resulting in cognitive or psychomotor impairment, and inhibitory effects on cholinergic activity. Pharmacological management approaches may include opioid dose reduction and rotation or psychostimulant use. Nonpharmacological approaches may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, and yoga. The most prevalent CES include: memory deficits (73–81%), sleep disturbance (35–57%), and fatigue (10%). At its most severe, extreme cognitive dysfunction can result in frank delirium and decreased alertness can result in coma. Emotional distress, sleep disorders, and other comorbidities and treatments can worsen CES, particularly among the elderly. Conclusions about the neuropsychological domains affected by opioids are limited due to the heterogeneity of studies and methodological issues.",

      "abstract": "inal symptoms at the same intensity as before treatment, entailing a return of the same episode and a new episode of illness, respectively [6, 9] . When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ). These types of withdrawal need to be differentiated from relapse and recurrence of the original illness.

A disease cannot be characterized as having a long or short induction period, except in relation to a specific etiologic component. Inappropriate assumptions, explicit or implicit, about the length of the combined induction and latent period (the “empirical induction period”) in an analytic study result in nondifferential misclassification and bias toward the null. Repeated analyses, varying the assumptions about the length of the empirical induction period, can be used to minimize such misclassification, thereby providing estimates for an undiluted measure of effect and the mode of the empirical induction period.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial.

That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

      "abstract": "The etiology of seizures in the Neurosurgical/Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NICU) can be categorized as emanating from either primary brain pathology, at either macro- or microscopic level, or from physiological derangements of critical care illness such as toxic or metabolic abnormalities. Particular etiologies at risk for seizures include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and traumatic brain injury. The use of prophylactic antiepileptic drug administration remains controversial in many situations, with most of the larger studies having used older antiepileptic drugs prophylactically. If seizures do occur, patients are typically treated with parenteral antiepileptic drugs. The duration of treatment is unknown in most situations, but it should be individualized depending on acute and monophasic injury versus chronic process. Late seizures, which occur after the first 2 weeks from the insult, have a more ominous risk for subsequent epilepsy and should be treated for extended periods of time or indefinitely. Electrolyte and glucose abnormalities and medications at high or low levels, when corrected, usually lead to seizure control. This review discusses the risk for seizures with commonly encountered types of brain injuries in the NICU and ends by examining the treatment algorithms for simple seizures and status epilepticus and the role newer antiepileptics may potentially play.",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

It is concluded that: (i) Differences in the clinical status of the schizophrenic subjects and whether they were receiving medication, but not the method used to measure aftereffects, may underlie the interstudy disagreements. (ii) The effect of schizophrenia is to increase MAE duration, and this is not due to some peripheral artefact.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

Estas se definen como un grupo de padecimientos de origen en muchos casos desconocido y que tienen como atributo común el curso progresivo de los síntomas derivados del daño estructural y funcional de diferentes zonas del sistema nervioso. La Demencia o Trastorno Cognitivo, ocurre cuando el cerebro se afecta por una enfermedad o afección específica que causa deterioro cognitivo. La secuencia en el espectro de la demencia puede terminar en la forma más grave de la enfermedad. El deterioro cognitivo en muchos casos transita desde el leve, referido a una disminución de la función cognitiva mayor de lo esperado por la edad y al nivel de educación del individuo, pero sin interferir con sus actividades cotidianas. El diagnóstico temprano de la enfermedad y la asunción de tratamientos y sobre todo estilos de vida saludables, puede evitar o enlentecer el tránsito hacia la gravedad de la enfermedad y por ende mejorar la calidad de vida. Con el objetivo de contribuir a este propósito se diseñó una herramienta de software denominada Neuromap que permite obtener patrones de conectividad a partir de señales de EEG y realizar una prueba de profundidad de la demencia. De esta forma se enriquecen los instrumentos con que cuentan en la actualidad los especialistas de las ciencias médicas para obtener un mejor y más eficaz diagnóstico.

      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction occurs when repeated use of drugs changes how a person’s brain functions over time. The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Benzodiazepines and Z‐drugs",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most guidelines recommend that benzodiazepines and z‐drugs used continuously for more than 4 weeks should be withdrawn, if the patient is agreeable, because of the unfavourable balance of harms (including physical dependence, addiction, tolerance and withdrawal effects) and benefits. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of benzodiazepines and z‐drugs – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Addiction is an issue only for a small minority of benzodiazepine users whilst withdrawal effects and physical dependence affect a much larger group of patients taking medication as prescribed. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering sometimes formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one benzodiazepine to a longer‐acting drug like diazepam can sometimes be helpful.",

Substance use disorders are best viewed on a spectrum and include abuse (harmful use) with eventual progression to dependence (addiction). Substance dependence is an irreversible, chronic, relapsing brain disease, marked by functional and structural brain changes and an inability to control the use of a substance despite negative consequences. Addicts do not have a realistic understanding of their problem (it is too painful); denial is not manipulative deception. Substances of abuse can be classified according to their effect on the CNS, e.g. stimulants, depressants, psychedelics. Substance use disorders should be approached by addressing the problem at various levels, including primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. Even substance abuse deserves an intervention in order to prevent disease progression to dependence. Detoxification is only a small part of the treatment process and is unlikely to be successful on its own. Brief interventions and motivational interviewing are useful skills in the management of substance use disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neurotoxic side effects of cancer therapy are second in frequency to hematological toxicity. Unlike hematological side effects that can be treated with hematopoietic growth factors, neuropathies cannot be treated and protective treatment strategies have not been effective. For the neurologist, the diagnosis of a toxic neuropathy is primarily based on the case history, the clinical and electrophysiological findings, and knowledge of the pattern of neuropathy associated with specific agents. In most cases, toxic neuropathies are length‐dependent, sensory, or sensorimotor neuropathies often associated with pain. The platinum compounds are unique in producing a sensory ganglionopathy. Neurotoxicity is usually dependent on cumulative dose. Severity of neuropathy increases with duration of treatment and progression stops once drug treatment is completed. The platinum compounds are an exception where sensory loss may progress for several months after cessation of treatment (“coasting”). As more effective multiple drug combinations are used, patients will be treated with several neurotoxic drugs. Synergistic neurotoxicity has not been extensively investigated. Pre‐existent neuropathy may influence the development of a toxic neuropathy. Underlying inherited or inflammatory neuropathies may predispose patients to developing very severe toxic neuropathies. Other factors such as focal radiotherapy or intrathecal administration may enhance neurotoxicity. The neurologist managing the cancer patient who develops neuropathy must answer a series of important questions as follows: (1) Are the symptoms due to peripheral neuropathy? (2) Is the neuropathy due to the underlying disease or the treatment? (3) Should treatment be modified or stopped because of the neuropathy? (4) What is the best supportive care in terms of pain management or physical therapy for each patient? Prevention of toxic neuropathies is most important. In patients with neuropathy, restorative approaches have not been well established. Symptomatic and other management are necessary to maintain and improve quality of life.",

Any type of epileptic seizure can develop into SE. Status epilepticus can be classified as generalized convulsive, non-convulsive and simple partial. Generalized convulsive SE includes tonic clonic seizures with either a partial or a generalized onset. Generalized tonic clonic status is defined when consecutive seizures occur without recovery of consciousness between them. Generalized tonic clonic SE is a medical emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality if untreated. The most common etiology of SE is non-compliance to antiepileptic drugs. Other causes include alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular lesions, drug intoxication, central nervous system infections, neoplasms and acute metabolic derangements. The metabolic-biochemical complication of SE includes respiratory and metabolic acidosis, anoxia, hyperazotemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions. Prognosis of SE depends on the duration and etiology of SE. Vigorous treatment of SE is recommended. Effective medical treatment of SE includes Benzodiazepines, Phenytoin, Barbiturates and several other new antiepileptic drugs. In this presentation, we discuss the updated management of SE and propose a protocol for management of convulsive SE.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

In contrast to tolerance or physical dependence, addiction is not simply a biological phenomenon. Psychological, environmental, and social factors can strongly influence its development. All these factors could explain the important variability of the clinical syndrome of addiction, and the various approaches that have been proposed to help addicts to stop their drug use.

For years, there has been a controversy as to whether addiction was simply a moral failing or a brain disease. Obviously, the latter is true. As with any disease, addiction and co-occurring disorders are frequently considered to be primary, progressive, chronic, and, if untreated, fatal. With the advent of more sophisticated neurobiological and multivariate research, we can get beyond trivializing this serious disease entity by labeling it as a weakness or character defect, and get on with the significant work of focusing on those neurological pathways and their etiology that are responsible for addictive patterns of behavior.",

Delirium can be precipitated by any somatic factor, which includes a variety of different illnesses, surgery, or substance (medication) intoxication or withdrawal. Predisposing factors are higher age and cognitive and functional impairment, among others. A final common pathway seems to be the most plausible for this multifactorial syndrome. The current leading candidate for the final pathway is the neurotransmitter state of relative acetylcholine deficiency and dopamine excess, together with an exaggerated inflammatory cascade. Although prevention of delirium should be the main aim, treatment consists of non-pharmacologic measures, reversing the precipitating conditions, and judicious use of antipsychotics in severely agitated patients only. Delirium is independently associated with an increase in mortality, impaired physical and cognitive recovery, and increased hospital costs.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

      "title": "The Effect of Insomnia Definitions, Terminology, and Classifications on Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "There is a need for newer, more clinically useful classifications for insomnia. Identification of specific subtypes of insomnia helps anchor research, allows for prediction of prognosis/course of the condition, and may allow for individualization of treatment. Existing classifications differ, and many terms remain inadequately defined, which leads to diagnostic confusion. Historically, insomnia has been classified according to symptom type, symptom duration, and underlying cause, but these classifications have not been based on evidence of their utility, and newer research suggests the need for change. Symptoms may include difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and not feeling restored by sleep, although it has not been clear that it is possible to identify distinct subtypes of patients by symptom or that distinguishing symptom type affects the course of clinical treatment. Classification of insomnia by duration most commonly involves three categories: transient (no more than a few days), short‐term (up to 3 weeks), and long‐term (more than 3 weeks). This categorization is of uncertain utility and has been primarily based on nonempiric concerns about treatment with sedative‐hypnotic medications for periods longer than several weeks. The subtyping of insomnia in terms of whether there is an identifiable underlying cause such as a psychiatric or medical illness was based on an unproven assumption that in most instances other disorders caused insomnia. Recent studies suggest the need to revisit these classification strategies. Evidence that symptom types typically overlap and change over time complicates the categorization of subjects by whether they have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep or have nonrestorative sleep. New studies of the treatment of chronic insomnia change the perspective on duration of treatment and, as a result, classification of duration of disease. Two studies of nightly pharmacotherapy for insomnia including more than 800 insomnia patients have not identified any increase in the risks after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. In addition, nonpharmacological treatments demonstrate long‐lasting efficacy in patients with chronic insomnia, and the development of abbreviated cognitive‐behavioral therapies, which are particularly well suited to primary care practice, have improved their applicability. Newer studies of the relationships between insomnia and associated medical and psychiatric conditions undermine the notion that insomnia is always a symptom and caused by an underlying condition. They suggest that, although it is important to identify and treat these conditions, this may not be sufficient to alleviate the insomnia, which may adversely affect the course of the associated disorder. As a result, treatment targeted specifically to the insomnia should be considered. All of these developments point to an increasing ability to tailor therapy to the particular needs of patients and to optimize the clinical management of insomnia.",

The examination of the offender's mental state may help to recognise undiagnosed neuro-psychiatric conditions. The case of a man, suspected to have violently murdered his spouse is reported. During his criminal act he was probably in a pathological mental state caused by alcoholic drunkenness and decreased emotional control; besides he may have ictal or interictal disturbance of consciousness. The alcoholic state does not limit culpability, while epileptic disturbance of consciousness may exempt the offender.",

      "abstract": "The repertoire of behavioral symptoms depends on the degree of severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to cognitive symptoms such as memory loss and language impairment, patients with AD often develop behavioral symptoms. While cognitive symptoms are required for the diagnosis of AD and are relentlessly progressive, behavioral symptoms are not inevitable, usually fluctuate in severity, and may be intermittent or transient. Before initiating treatment, the physician must determine whether physical illness, medications, or environmental or interpersonal factors are contributing to the behavioral symptoms. Elderly patients are more sensitive than younger adults to medication effects and side effects. The combination of aging and AD produces marked deficits of brain neurotransmitter systems, particularly acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Delusions and hallucinations occur most often in patients with AD who have mild to moderately severe dementia. Anxiety is relatively uncommon in patients with AD. Several classes of medications may be used, most of which can produce tolerance with long-term use.",

New Results: Chronic drug use indeed impacts negatively on human's cognitive functions, especially in terms of attention, learning, and memory. With increasing amount of certain drug use, the degree of impairments also increases. It is unsure if the memory deficits that result from drug abuse persist forever as study examining memory impairments after more than a month's abstinence of drug use is not found. Conclusion: Therefore, it is incorrect to say that drug users or ex-drug users are incapable of learning; instead, as a result of neurological changes in the brain caused by chronic drug use, learning may take more time and effort for them as compared to non-drug users.",

      "title": "Retrograde Amnesia – A Question of Disturbed Calcium Levels?",
      "abstract": "Retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events or information. The successful acquisition and memory of information is required before retrograde amnesia may occur. Often, the trigger for retrograde amnesia is a traumatic event. Loss of memories may be caused in two ways: either by loss/erasure of the memory itself or by the inability to access the memory, which is still present. In general, memories and learning are associated with a positive connotation although the extinction of unpleasant experiences and memories of traumatic events may be highly welcome. In contrast to the many experimental models addressing learning deficits caused by anterograde amnesia, the incapability to acquire new information, retrograde amnesia could so far only be investigated sporadically in human patients and in a limited number of model systems. Apart from models and diseases in which neurodegeneration or dementia like Alzheimer’s disease result in loss of memory, retrograde amnesia can be elicited by various drugs of which alcohol is the most prominent one and exemplifies the non-specific effects and the variable duration. External or internal impacts like traumatic brain injury, stroke, or electroconvulsive treatments may similarly result in variable degrees of retrograde amnesia. In this review, I will discuss a new genetic approach to induce retrograde amnesia in a mouse model and raise the hypothesis that retrograde amnesia is caused by altered intracellular calcium homeostasis. Recently, we observed that neuronal loss of neuroplastin resulted in retrograde amnesia specifically for associative memories. Neuroplastin is tightly linked to the expression of the main Ca 2+ extruding pumps, the plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs). Therefore, neuronal loss of neuroplastin may block the retrieval and storage of associative memories by interference with Ca 2+ signaling cascades. The possibility to elicit retrograde amnesia in a controlled manner allows to investigate the underlying mechanisms and may provide a deeper understanding of the molecular and circuit processes of memory.",

      "title": "Overtraining Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Definitions Functional overreaching (FOR): intensified training results in a temporary decline in performance. When appropriate periods of recovery are provided, a positive \"supercompensation\" effect occurs, with the athlete exhibiting enhanced performance. Nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR): an accumulation of training and/or nontraining stress resulting in short-term decrement in performance capacity with or without related physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of maladaptation in which restoration of performance capacity may take from several days to several weeks. Overtraining syndrome (OTS): same as NFOR, except decrement is long-term and restoration takes several weeks or months. Key point: the difference between NFOR and OTS is the amount of time needed for performance restoration; therefore, the diagnosis of OTS can often only be made retrospectively (3). Pathophysiology Unknown, biochemical/hormonal hypotheses include the following: glycogen depletion, central fatigue/branched chain fatty acid depletion, glutamine depletion/immune dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, oxidative stress, hypothalamic dysregulation, and cytokine release/inflammation (1,2). The mechanism triggering these changes often involves a training error that results in imbalance between energy expenditure load and recovery. This typically occurs in combination with a complex set of psychological factors and environmental stressors (e.g., monotony of training, excessive competitions, sleep disturbances, interpersonal difficulties, academic/occupational stressors, illness, altitude exposure, heat or cold injury, etc.). Epidemiology Most commonly seen in endurance events such as swimming, cycling, or running Prevalence and incidence data for true OTS are lacking; the lifetime prevalence of NFOR/OTS is estimated to be approximately 30% for nonelite endurance athletes and 60% for elite athletes (2,3). Important Differential Diagnoses NFOR/OTS is a diagnosis of exclusion (1). Common: caffeine withdrawal, environmental allergies, exercise-induced bronchospasm, infectious mononucleosis, insufficient sleep, anemia, performance anxiety, inadequate carbohydrate or protein intake, mood disorder, psychosocial stress, upper respiratory infection. Less common: dehydration, diabetes mellitus, eating disorder, hepatitis, hypothyroidism, lower respiratory infection, medication side effect (antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihistamine, β-blocker), post-concussive syndrome, pregnancy, substance abuse. Rare but important: adrenocortical insufficiency or excess, congenital or acquired heart disease, arrhythmia, bacterial endocarditis, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus, malabsorption syndrome, chronic lung disease, Lyme disease, malaria, malignancy, neuromuscular disorder, chronic renal disease, syphilis. Evaluation Thorough history including chief complaint, training program, diet, medications, nutrition, illness, review of systems, and assessment of training goals. Hallmark feature in history: athletes with NFOR/OTS are usually able to start a normal training sequence or a race at their normal pace but are not able to complete the training load they are given or race as usual (3). Initial laboratory examinations: complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate/C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, iron studies, creatine kinase, urinalysis, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Consider monospot, hepatitis panel, Lyme titer, toxicology screen, and chest x-ray. Prescribe absolute rest for 2 wk. ○ If mood is adversely affected with full rest, consider relative rest with well-defined expectations. If improved at follow-up, focus on adjustments to training and prevention (as follows). If no improvement, consider NFOR/OTS: ○ Will require prolonged training rest and further workup ○ Consider consulting with a sports psychologist and nutritionist. ○ Sequence of advancing activity should focus on frequency, then duration, then intensity (1,2). Monitoring Monitor performance in time trials and standard exercise challenges. There are currently no good practical biomarkers for NFOR/OTS (2). Psychiatric indicators may be most useful. Examples include the Profile of Mood States and Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (1). A two-bout maximal exercise protocol has shown differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response for athletes with FOR, NFOR, and OTS and may have prognostic value (2). Prevention Considerations for coaches, athletic trainers, and health care providers (2,3): Maintain accurate records of performance and encourage athletes to keep a diary of training load. Emphasize adequate rest and \"time out\" periods when performance declines, when an athlete complains of fatigue, or after illness or injury. Individualize and supervise training program. Avoid monotony of training. Encourage and reinforce optimal nutrition, hydration, and sleep. Be aware of life stressors, and communicate with athletes about physical, mental, and emotional concerns. Consider regular psychological questionnaires. Schedule regular health checks with a multidisciplinary team.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The case of a young man with bipolar disorder who recovered from neuroleptic malignant syndrome but subsequently developed extensive neurological sequelae is described. Key words: Basal ganglia, drug effects, Cerebellum, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, complications Introduction Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare, idiosyncratic reaction, commonly associated with neuroleptic treatment. It is potentially fatal, with mortality rates of 10 to 20%. Most fatalities occur early - pneumonia and renal failure account for the majority of deaths during this stage. (1) Patients who survive NMS usually completely recover. (2) Long-term neurological sequelae after an episode of NMS are rare, and their clinical manifestations diverse. However, there has been no systematic research on the subject. Thus, the incidence and prevalence of post-NMS neurological sequelae are unknown. Case reports indicate that presentations vary from subtle neuropsychological deficits such as transient or persistent cognitive impairment, including organic amnesic syndromes, (3-5) to widespread cerebellar damage. (2,6,7) Persistent abnormal involuntary movement disorders, such as dyskinesias, rigidity, hypertonia, dysarthria, and tremors following NMS have also been described. (8-11) This report describes the case of a young man with bipolar disorder, who recovered from NMS, but subsequently developed extensive neurological sequelae. Case Report A 20-year-old, previously healthy, computer student developed symptoms of elation, overactivity, grandiosity, disinhibition, overspending, disturbed sleep, and poor self care over a period of 2 weeks without any apparent precipitant. A private psychiatrist diagnosed mania. Treatment commenced with a combination of oral and injectable haloperidol (total daily dose 10 to 40 mg/day) and lithium carbonate 600 mg/day. Carbamazepine 600 mg/day was added in a further effort to control symptoms. Manic symptoms subsided with this treatment, but after 3 weeks the patient developed a high-grade fever (39.4 to 40.5[degrees]C) and diffuse macular rashes. Carbamazepine was withdrawn. However, on the following day, the patient developed rigidity of the neck and back, rapidly extending to involve the whole body. All psychotropic medication was discontinued. The patient was treated with antibiotics and antipyretics, with little evident response. He was referred to the Department of Psychiatry at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research for further management. On admission, the patient was found to be febrile, and sweating profusely. He became progressively more rigid, mute, incontinent, unresponsive, and finally comatose. Investigations revealed leukocytosis, and a serum creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme MM (CPK-MM) level of 3730 IU/L (normal range, 30 to 140 IU/L). Other investigations, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, urine/blood cultures, viral serology for herpes simplex virus (HSV), and computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain were all normal. He was hypoxic (P[O.sub.2] = 45) and required respiratory support for 3 days. By the third day after admission, a diagnosis of NMS was made. Bromocriptine therapy 5 mg/day was initiated and gradually increased to 20 mg/day. This led to considerable improvement, with fever and rigidity subsiding over the following 3 to 4 weeks. Sensorium improved and the patient was able to recognise family members. He was able to comprehend language but, due to a severe dysarthria, was only able to communicate by gestures. The patient remained confined to bed and had minimal ability to move his limbs. Dyskinetic, choreoathetoid, and dystonic movements were noted for the first time during this period. The patient's recovery was further complicated by left lung collapse, secondary to an inspissated mucous plug, which was subsequently removed bronchoscopically. …",

It should be differentiated from occasional drug use, from drug abuse with minor consequences as well from medical drug dependency in which the individual does not seek a psychological effect. Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief.

In addition to physical symptoms related to nervous system hyperexcitability, withdrawal includes changes in mental state that may motivate renewed AOD consumption. The manifestations of addiction are associated with changes in nerve cell function by which the brain attempts to adapt to a drug's presence. These functional changes modulate a person's initial response to a drug, the establishment of long-term craving for the drug (i.e., addiction), and the persistent sense of discomfort that leads to relapse after abstinence has been achieved. Research is beginning to reveal how specific brain regions may be integrated to form neural circuits that modulate aspects of addiction.",

      "abstract": "The defining feature of neurocognitive disorders is a decline in cognitive functioning. Patients suffering from delirium experience an acute change in mental status, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an inability to acquire new information. Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

      "title": "A Review of Addiction",
      "abstract": "Addiction to drugs and alcohol is often undiagnosed and untreated. Physicians are often unaware or have negative attitudes regarding these patients, such as the perception that treatment is ineffective. Addiction--psychological dependence with or without tolerance and withdrawal--is essentially compulsive uncontrolled substance use despite physical, psychological, or social consequences. We now have an understanding of the 2 major neurological pathways involved in addiction. First, the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, which is essential for survival, can be physically altered by drug abuse to result in uncontrolled cravings. Second, the decision-making prefrontal cortex, which suppresses inappropriate reward response, can also be altered by drug abuse. Thus, accelerated \"go\" signals and impaired \"stop\" signals result in uncontrolled use despite severe consequences. Further, addicts can be predisposed to addiction by genetic defects in reward pathway neurotransmission and stress-related developmental brain abnormalities. Relapse to drug use can occur because of stress or cue-related reward pathway stimulation or even by a single drug dose. Individualized treatment of addiction, including pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions, can be as successful as treatment of other chronic diseases. Several pharmaceuticals are available or under study for these disorders. Waiting for the addict to \"be ready\" for treatment can be dangerous and detoxification alone is often ineffective. The physician's role in treating addiction includes prevention, diagnosis, brief intervention, motivational interviewing, referral, and follow-up care. An understanding of the biological reality of addiction allows physicians to understand addicts as having a brain disease. Further, the reality of effective pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments for addiction allows physicians to be more optimistic in treating addicts. The challenge to the physician is to embrace the reality of addictive disease and fulfill his or her role in its treatment.",

      "abstract": "Objective: There is increasing concern that the course of psychiatric disorders may be affected by parameters such as the duration and intensity of symptoms of initial episodes of illness. As this indicates that abnormal function produces long-term changes within the brain, a review of the neuroscience literature regarding neuroplasticity is warranted. Method: This article is a selective review, focusing in particular on results obtained from physiological experiments assessing plasticity within the mammalian neocortex. The possible relevance of results to psychiatry is discussed. Results: While the most dramatic examples of neuroplasticity occur during a critical period of neural development, neuroplasticity can also occur in adult neocortex. Neuroplasticity appears to be activity-dependent: synaptic pathways that are intensively used may become strengthened, and conversely, there may be depression of transmission in infrequently used pathways. Conclusions: Results from neurophysiological experiments lend support to the clinical observation that the intensity and duration of a psychiatric disorder may adversely alter its long-term course. Rapid aggressive treatment may prevent this from occurring. While pharmacotherapy may reduce the duration and severity of symptoms, it may also have an independent, as yet unknown, effect on neuroplasticity.",

Population-based studies did not reveal a difference in cognitive functions between migraineurs and controls. The specific cognitive domains involved are information processing speed, basic attention, executive functions, verbal and non-verbal memory and verbal skills. Neurophysiological, imaging and pharmacological studies support clinical symptoms of cognitive impairment in migraine. Longitudinal studies do not suggest progressive cognitive decline over time in migraine patients. Preventive medications and comorbid disorders such as depression and anxiety can impact cognitive function, but cannot fully explain the cognitive impairment in migraine. In contrast to migraine, tension type or cluster headache are not associated with cognitive impairment, at least during headache-free periods.",

The onset and severity of terminal decline vary greatly between individuals. It is thought that a certain degree of cognitive decline occurs due to biological changes in the aging human brain, but evidence suggests that more abrupt and perceptible decline is often associated with an underlying death process or disease pathology. Decline is often gradual and relatively imperceptible for a period of several years, then increases dramatically in closer proximity to death. Future investigations are necessary to characterize disease‐specific decline trajectories and understand how specific areas of cognition (i.e., memory, vocabulary) are affected by terminal decline.",

Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

Neurological critical care unit provides care for patients also with seizure disorders. Most seizures in critical ill patients are nonconvulsive and some patients may develop nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Continuous electroencephalography monitoring is commonly used in critically ill patients and can identify nonconvulsive seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Patients with severe traumatic brain injury and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage seem to benefit with a short course of antiseizure medications. However, the utility regarding prophylactic use of antiseizure medications in various neurological conditions encountered in the neurocritical care unit, in patients without clinical seizures, with an underlying neurological injury, is somewhat controversial. The treatment of seizures in neurocritical care unit must be individualized. It must depend on the type, frequency, severity, and duration of seizures, and whether episodes have been known to progress to prolonged seizures or seizure clusters or status epilepticus. Control of seizure clusters and status epilepticus in neurocritical care units generally follows the intravenous administration of medications such as benzodiazepine and antiseizure medications.",

Second, they consistently demonstrate relapse to the agent of abuse; that is, they attempt to stop using the drug for varying periods of time but return to it despite a specific intent to avoid it. This treatment approach is not necessary for those abusers who can, in fact, learn to set limits on their use of alcohol or drugs; their use may be treated as a behavioral symptom in a more traditional psychotherapeutic fashion. Nor is it directed at those patients for whom the addictive pattern is most unmanageable (e.g., addicted people with unusual destabilizing circumstances such as homelessness, severe character pathology, or psychosis).

      "title": "Cell-based therapies for neural replacement strategies in stroke-related neurodegeneration: neurophysiological insights into stem progenitor cell neurogenesis within a host environment",
      "abstract": "The restricted neurogenesis limits the brain ability to overcome neuronal cell death following ischemic lesion: Failure of the damaged brain to regenerate following cerebral ischemia results in functional deficits those are most often irreversible and can further deteriorate, causing mortality and severe disability, progressive memory loss and cognitive impairments, known as dementia. This is caused by massive neuronal cell death and neurotoxicity following limited blood supply to the brain. Ischemic death of brain neurons (acute or delayed after lesion) has been the etiology of vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Multiple types of vascular dementia exist, common in cognitive decline that gradually worsens and variable in where strokes happen (subcortical dementia) or how severe lesions are (e.g., major stroke, series of small strokes or brief transient ischemic attacks). It has emerged a synergistic combination of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease that often comes (mixed dementia). For over the last three decades after the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death had been discovered, intense research has been focused on withdrawing or, at least, attenuating neurodegeneration to improve restoring function in experimental models of post-stroke cognitive impairments while mimicking focal ischemia, permanent or transient brain lesions, hypertension or reproducing Alzheimer's disease combined with vascular pathology [for review (Hainsworth et al., 2017)]. Long-standing perspectives that ischemic neuronal death might be potentially suspended through activation of endogenous neuroprotection stay with genomic reprogramming and/or gene activation for de novo protein synthesis, relied on the hypoxia-activated signaling pathways (Dirnagl et al., 2009). On the other hands, pre-clinical studies, including our own works (Kopach et al., 2016; Rybachuk et al., 2017), have reported functional impairments at the later times (weeks) post-ischemia (as in principal neurons as within network), with controversial effectiveness of pharmacological therapeutics utilized after lesion. Unfulfilled regeneration convinces experimental neuroscientists to focus on cell-based therapies for neuronal replacement strategies used to overcome massive neuronal loss in the brain tissue subjected to ischemia. The major issue, however, remains how this therapy should be utilized in order to promote beneficial effects timely, namely via engraftment of neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) or already differentiated stem cell-derived neurons into the damaged brain. From that, the other conceptual question arises regarding the regulatory role of a host environment in either NSPC neurogenesis or functional integration of the grafted stem cell-derived cells. If choose the latter, what 'proper' proportion of the entirely different phenotypes needs to be grafted to possibly succeed? More insights into this are essential when considering cell therapy while aiming at remodeling of the damaged post-stroke brain from mixed stem cell-derived cells for restoring the broken functionality of such a complex tissue as the brain. NSPC grafts mature neuronal phenotype within a host tissue in a weeks' time: The survival rate of differentiated stem cell-derived cells grafted into the organized brain tissue has been routinely low – this suggests a strong regulatory role of the host environment in the viability of stem cells. As an alternative, grafting NSPCs could potentially promote the multipotent stem cell differentiation and subsequent maturation of the entirely different phenotypes, regulated by endogenous environment, to pave the way towards 'self-repair' of damaged tissue while engaging the endogenous mechanisms of self-renewal. However, discoveries in this field are hampered by technical challenges and controversy in clinically translatable advances. Eventually, the enormous potential of stem cell therapy has been evidenced for post-stroke recovery (Tornero et al., 2017) while its neurophysiological basis has been much less learned thus far. Repeatedly reported common patterns of firing and synaptic activity have been recorded from the stem cell-derived neurons at the very end time-points – typically few months after transplantation – that fosters underestimation of the time-dependent neurophysiological integration of differentiated cells into the host tissue. In our recent study, we have traced the time courses of maturation and integration of the NSPC-derived neurons into the host circuits, demonstrating their matured excitability and synaptogenesis (to the level of endogenous principal neurons – CA1 pyramidal neurons) within 3 weeks or less in situ (Kopach et al., 2018). To neurophysiological point of view, biophysical properties (Na+/K+ conductance, capability for high-frequency firing, characteristic excitatory transmission) make these cells physiologically credible those are capable to constitute specified relationships with other cells, providing functional impact. This also points out the accelerated rate of neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts in situ when compared with much longer time required to achieve similar patterns of activity by stem cell-derived neurons in vitro (Morgan et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2012; Telezhkin et al., 2016). For restorative neuroscience, a query remains to precisely define the timing of NSPC-derived phenotypes mature and set the appropriate activity within the damaged, pathophysiological environment. Establishing this is primary to enabling the assessment of timing for emerging beneficial effects, to design and rationale further reaching perspectives for accelerating stem cell neurogenesis while considering replacement strategies for various post-stroke brain regions (subpopulations of neurons, other neural cell types). Post-ischemic environment regulates neurogenesis of NSPC grafts: An in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia provides technological advantages for feasibly exploring the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death together with managing therapeutic approaches for targeted interventions in the organized brain tissue. In translational neuroscience, this methodology benefits with a meaningful consideration of variable experimental modifications utilized to mimic ischemic insult and onset of cell therapy (depending on how severe and complex the ischemic impairments are, diverse stem cell origin, etc.). In our study of an in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia optimized for a delayed death of principal neurons [within 2 weeks instead of acute CA1 neuronal death (Rybachuk et al., 2017)], we have traced the functional properties of NSPC grafts over the time in the hippocampal tissue subjected to ischemia (Figure 1; Kopach et al., 2018). The post-ischemic environment influenced neurogenesis of NSPC grafts in different ways. Neuronal maturation has been delayed, both excitability and synaptogenesis, at each time points tested (for over 3 weeks in total; Figure 1). Instead, multipotent NSPC differentiation has been prompted towards the non-neuronal phenotype – we have identified the NSPC-derived glial cells as fast as within a week in the post-ischemic tissue. Such principal difference in the stem cell fate between control and post-ischemic environments implies the determinant, yet underestimated, regulatory role of the host tissue in neurogenesis of NSPCs, both differentiation profile (neuronal vs. non-neuronal) and neurophysiological maturation.Figure 1: The experimental scheme of neural stem progenitor cell (NSPC) administration in an in situ model of stroke.A carton shows the time course for functional assessment of the NSPC-derived neural maturation in a host tissue (organotypic hippocampal tissue subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation of 10 minutes duration, with onset of the therapy after 2 hours (h) of re-oxygenation). W: Week(s).Endogenous facilitators of stem cell fate: Ischemic cell damage results in the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity followed by massive neuronal death and overwhelmed neurotoxicity. Ultimately, different signaling molecules and mediators are released those levels became dramatically heightened, overloading the extracellular matrix and activating a vast majority of signaling pathways, with an immense variety of molecular mechanisms being involved. Moreover, during neuronal cell death, necrotic, pro-apoptotic factors and mediators of inflammation activate pro-inflammatory signaling, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and others, pertinent to overactivated astrocytic response featuring the post-ischemic brain. Numerous signaling cascades can, thus, contribute to how the ischemia-subjected environment governs the fate of NSPC grafts. The notable regulatory roles in stem cell differentiation have been evidenced for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), Ca2+-dependent Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), and Wnt signaling pathways in in vitro and in vivo studies, among the involved cAMP, protein kinase C (PKC) and CaMK pathways, and phospholipase C and D signaling activation (Le Belle et al., 2011; Telezhkin et al., 2016). Therefore, pharmacological or genetic manipulations modulating presently dissecting signaling pathways, providing multiple growth facilitators, such as neurotrophins, to support intrinsic growth capacity of differentiating neurons, neutralizing high levels of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the post-ischemic tissue can accelerate neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts. Further, the supposed beneficial effects may include neurogenesis of the resident neural stem cells of the brain for activating endogenous self-renewal. By contrast, the non-neural (glial) NSPC differentiation, prompted up in the post-ischemic tissue, assumes the ROS-mediated regulation of NSPCs. The activated Notch signaling eliciting the latent neurogenic program in astrocytes after stoke (Magnusson et al., 2014) may have a synergistic effect on the post-ischemic NSPC differentiation to astrocytes. Functional restoration via multipotent NSPC function: Outcome after cell therapy is mediated by diverse mechanisms underlying functional improvements in the post-stroke recovery. Our study implies that NSPC therapy comprised primarily of promoted neurogenesis to a glial lineage that emerges shortly after initiating the therapy in the ischemia-subjected brain tissue (Kopach et al., 2018). This initial stage includes supplying the damaged tissue with the NSPC-derived astrocytes and oligodendrocytes – the output assuming the glia-related neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. The stem cell-derived astrocytes enhance the viability of brain cells by secreting various neurotrophic factors and supporting cell regeneration, evidenced for improving neurological function of post-stroke brain (Jiang et al., 2013), whereas oligodendrocytes' role has been proven in re-myelination and axon regeneration, both essential to synaptic networking (Figure 2). Such glial-directed differentiation of NSPC grafts, driven by overactivated master regulators that heavily burden the post-ischemic tissue, may mirror endogenous mechanism of boosting the glia-mediated tissue clearance following ischemic neuronal cell death. As the cellular debris became cleared and pro-apoptotic and inflammatory mediators recede, multipotent NSPC neurogenesis towards neuronal maturation takes place, which is the longer lasting process. Indeed, the ability of multipotent stem cells to mature with higher efficacy to neurons in astrocyte co-cultures had been evidenced. Other roles of glial cells have included the active astrocytic contribution to synapse formation, plasticity and remodeling that should facilitate network remodeling in the post-stroke tissue.Figure 2: The current concept of NSPC-therapy in stroke-related neurodegeneration encompasses the multipotent differentiation of NSPC grafts in a host tissue for replacement of various neural phenotypes after ischemia-induced cell loss for restoring the function in multiple ways.Conclusions and future perspectives: Ischemia-induced neuronal cell death is one of the leading causes of the brain damage that results in high rate of mortality and severe disability in patients after stroke (series of strokes). The stroke-related neurodegeneration gives rise to numerous neurological disorders, including cognitive decline (vascular dementia), motor disability (paralysis), and others associated with a wide range of impairments. Massive neuronal death after stroke could be barely overcame only by pharmacological interventions, but requires also implementation of cell therapies for replacement strategies. Although the long history of stem cell research had provided conceptual advances and clinical relevance of cell-based therapy, it has been less understood the neurophysiological basis of such tremendous effects of stem cells on the post-stroke recovery of brain function. Because recovery of the brain is not a single process, it is essential to clearly define the precise timing required for maturing of neurophysiological activity, ranging from intrinsic excitability to network function, for the entirely different stem cell-derived phenotypes. Dissecting this will expand the knowledge about stem cell therapy to find how best to use multiple routes of the therapy (induced pluripotent or embryonic stem cells) for the stroke-related neurodegeneration. More work is needed on defining the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell neurogenesis to provide the field with a meaningful consideration of cell therapy in context of promoting 'self-repair' of the post-stroke brain by engaging endogenous brain recovery mechanisms to power self-renewal. The perspective remains in accelerating neurophysiological maturation of neuronal phenotypes in the post-ischemic tissue tailored to enhancing the functional influence and, thereby, maximizing beneficial effects. Understanding the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell grafts will foster cell therapy use to augment therapeutic interventions in stroke-related neurodegeneration and to improve ultimate outcome.",

It is unclear whether children that develop the syndrome had entirely normal cognitive skills before seizure onset, since subtle impairment easily escapes recognition in small infants. It is also difficult to demonstrate whether a recognisable profile of cognitive impairment or a definite behavioural phenotype exists. No clear‐cut imaging or neuropathological marker or substrate has been recognised for cognitive impairment in this syndrome. However, there are different potentially causative factors, including the specific effects on the Nav1.1 channels caused by the underlying genic or genomic defect; frequent and prolonged convulsive and non‐convulsive seizures or status epilepticus; recurrent subtle ictal phenomena, such as that accompanying pronounced visual sensitivity; the use of antiepileptic drugs with cognitive side effects, especially in heavy multiple‐drug therapy; and the restrictions that children with severe epilepsy inevitably undergo.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The term “developmental and epileptic encephalopathy” (DEE) refers to when cognitive functions are influenced by both seizure and interictal epileptiform activity and the neurobiological process behind the epilepsy. Many DEEs are related to gene variants and the onset is typically during early childhood. In this setting, neurocognition, whilst not improved by seizure control, may benefit from some precision therapies. In patients with non‐progressive diseases with cognitive impairment and co‐existing epilepsy, in whom the epileptiform activity does not affect or has minimal effect on function, the term “developmental encephalopathy” (DE) can be used. In contrast, for those patients with direct impact on cognition due to epileptic or epileptiform activity, the term “epileptic encephalopathy” (EE) is preferred, as most can revert to their normal or near normal baseline cognitive state with appropriate intervention. These children need aggressive treatment. Clinicians must tailor care towards individual needs and realistic expectations for each affected person; those with DE are unlikely to gain from aggressive antiseizure medication whilst those with EE will gain. Patients with DEE might benefit from a precision medicine approach in order to reduce the overall burden of epilepsy.",

      "title": "Fahrtuechtigkeit bei der Alzheimer-Erkrankung",
      "abstract": "Im Anschluss an einen zahlenmaessigen Ueberblick ueber das Vorkommen der Alzheimer-Erkrankung in den Altersgruppen ab 65 Jahren in Deutschland werden die Auswirkungen der Alzheimer-Demenz (AD) auf die Fahrtauglichkeit diskutiert. Die Beeintraechtigungen der AD werden in die Auspraegungsgrade leicht, mittel und schwer unterschieden, denen eine Praedemenzphase von etwa fuenf bis sieben Jahren mit leichten, teils schwer erfassbaren kognitiven Beeintraechtigungen vorausgeht. Die Symptome bei fortschreitender Erkrankung werden im Einzelnen beschrieben. Bei mittleren und schweren Auspraegungsgraden sind die Betroffenen nicht mehr in der Lage, ein Fahrzeug sicher zu fuehren. In der Praedemenzphase und im Fruehstadium ist es fraglich, inwieweit und wie lange die Fahrfaehigkeit ohne erhoehtes Risiko erhalten bleibt. Der individuelle Krankheitsverlauf fuehrt dazu, dass die Fahreignung unterschiedlich lange erhalten bleibt. Nicht alleine die Leistungsdefizite sind entscheidend, sondern die Faehigkeit zur Kompensation und deren Aufrechterhaltung. Im Abschnitt ueber Rechtsvorschriften und Richtlinien werden die Begutachtungs-Leitlinien zur Kraftfahrereignung zitiert. Danach ist derjenige nicht in der Lage, ein Kraftfahrzeug zu fuehren, der unter einer ausgepraegten Demenz leidet. Dabei ist der Nachweis fuer ausgepraegte Leistungsmaengel unklar, da nicht sichergestellt ist, ob und wie lange Defizite kompensiert werden koennen. Die Leistungsueberpruefungen mittels neuropsychologischer Testungen korrelieren bei aelteren Menschen nur gering mit den Ergebnissen des praktischen Fahrverhaltens. In kritischen Faellen ist eine Fahrverhaltensprobe anzuraten, in der die Faehigkeit zur Kompensation erfasst wird, die entscheidend zur Erhaltung der Fahrfaehigkeit ist. Abschliessend wird ueber den derzeitigen Forschungsstand zur Fahreignung bei Patienten mit AD berichtet. Beitrag zum 3.

Recientemente, se le ha dado gran importancia al deterioro cognitivo, por ser un síntoma frecuente y discapacitante. Este deterioro está presente en un 40 a 65% de los pacientes y afecta la velocidad de procesamiento de información, atención compleja, memoria de trabajo, memoria visual y verbal, fluencia verbal y funciones ejecutivas. Se puede presentar en el síndrome radiológico aislado, en el síndrome clínico aislado y en las diferentes fases de la enfermedad; además, es el responsable de la dependencia de algunos pacientes y de las dificultades para mantener o conseguir empleo. Este déficit cognitivo se asocia a atrofia del tálamo y se ha observado una correlación con las medidas de atrofia y con el volumen lesional cerebral. Existen diferentes herramientas para su evaluación; hay pruebas de cribado breves de 5 minutos de duración, hasta baterías extensas de 90 minutos. Respecto al tratamiento de las alteraciones cognitivas, no existe un tratamiento farmacológico específico; sin embargo, se considera que los fármacos modificadores de la enfermedad podrían tener una influencia favorable en la función cognitiva por sus efectos en la reducción de la actividad inflamatoria y la atrofia cerebral. En cuanto a la estimulación cognitiva, no existen datos concluyentes por las diferentes técnicas empleadas y las distintas medidas utilizadas para evaluar los resultados de las intervenciones.",

Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

This transition fits the definition of neuroplasticity, defined as the ability of the nervous system to modify its response to a stimulus based on prior experience. However, it is an exceptionally powerful and persistent form of plasticity. Episodic craving persists for years in humans (2), and animal studies show that conditioned responses to cocaine-related stimuli are highly resistant to extinction (3).",

Dauerhafte kognitive Defizite allein aufgrund einer unmittelbaren neurotoxischen Wirkung des thanol sind sehr selten; sie sind meist mit neurologischen oder internistischen Alkoholfolgekrankheiten assoziiert bzw. der Alkohol wirkt als Kofaktor. Die neurobiologischen Korrelate sind nicht sehr spezifisch. Verschiedene pathogenetische Mechanismen werden diskutiert, die aus der Perspektive der Neurogenese besser verständlich werden. Eine besondere Rolle spielt das Korsakoff-Syndrom, wobei überkommene Vorstellungen zum Wernicke-Korsakoff-Komplex wahrscheinlich revidiert werden müssen. Nur Alkoholmissbrauch erhöht das Demenzrisiko, während moderater Alkoholkonsum mit einem gegenüber Abstinenz verminderten Risiko einhergeht. Der Terminus “Alkohol-assoziierte kognitive Beeinträchtigungen” (“alcohol-related cognitive impairment”) erscheint als übergeordnete Bezeichnung zweckmäßig.

      "title": "Delayed onset and resolution of pain: Some observations and implications",
      "abstract": "Occasionally, pain after disease or trauma develops only after a prolonged interval. Examples include late-onset pains which first occur months or years following a stroke, spinal cord lesion or amputation of a limb; a previously experienced pain that is recalled years later; and latent pain triggered for the first time by a further insult in the same area. Late-onset pains may develop gradually or suddenly, and may be brief or long standing. Pains which develop after an innocuous insult may be associated with slowly evolving sensory changes. However, even long-standing pains, particularly those of nociceptive origin, may resolve sometimes after many years. Resolution, which again can occur gradually or suddenly, may be spontaneous or follow development of another disorder or after therapeutic intervention. The duration of this pain relief can range from minutes to an indefinite period. These clinical phenomena, and the mechanisms, including genetic factors, subserving them, have been little studied. It is postulated that mechanisms implicated in acute pain may not be the same as those that subserve pain that develops after a long interval. Those late-onset pains which develop slowly after innocuous lesions may be associated with a variety of slow anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes. In late-onset pains that follow a painful insult, however, memory of the former pain and threshold triggering factors may be particularly important. Further studies of these neglected conditions may lead to understanding of as yet unknown processes subserving pain and to novel approaches to treatment.",

Minor adverse sedation-related events may present inconvenience or transient discomfort to the patient and, if recognized and supported in a timely manner by the sedationist, will not usually result in physiologic or psychological harm to the patient. Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 200 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training for sedationists to effectively respond to or preempt them.

      "abstract": "Neuropathy may be difficult to distinguish from neuronopathy, on both motor and sensory sides. A number of disorders that present with characteristic electro-clinical features are readily recognized. Except for those, distinction of the lesions that concern the peripheral nerve cell or the axon may require support of clinical, electrophysiological and other ancillary tests. Distinction between motor neuropathy and neuronopathy can be based on the abnormalities of nerve conduction and on the signs that relate to the reinnervation process. Signs of terminal axonal reinnervation, such as motor axon reflex, may be observed in axonal neuronopathies, whereas only collateral reinnervation occurs in motor neuronopathies. Sensory axonopathies are usually characterized by clinical and electrophysiological findings that are axon length-dependent, by the course of the disorder that is most often chronic, and by possible reversibility. Sensory neuronopathies are usually subacute and induce clinical deficits that are more or less widespread to the whole body surface rather than distal. Follow-up studies disclose limited or absent recovery. A better knowledge of the structural differences of motor and sensory neurons and axons will improve our understanding and lead to the development of specific tests. Meanwhile, although some parameters and techniques should still be improved, electrophysiological and additional tests are useful to detect and to distinguish the peripheral nerve disorders that affect the nerve cell bodies and their axons.",

In this study, 50 violent offenders were interviewed with neuropsychological and psychometric measures, to determine the factors that underlie amnesia and the recovery of memory in these cases. The results showed that amnesia for a violent offense was associated with crimes of passion and dissociative symptoms at the time, but not with impaired neuropsychological functioning. Long amnesic gaps were associated with a state of dissociation surrounding the offense and with previous blackouts (whether alcoholic or dissociative). Memory often recovered, either partially or completely, especially where there was a history of blackouts or a lengthy amnesic gap. Brief amnesic gaps were likely to persist, perhaps as a consequence of faulty encoding during a period of extreme emotional arousal (or red-out).",

Ich patologia wiąże się z utratą komórek nerwowych, zaś istota procesu chorobowego wiedzie do wystąpienia wielu objawów uszkodzeń neurologicznych, związanych z funkcją motoryczną (np. ataksja) oraz z pamięcią (demencja). Proces wiodący do pojawienia się objawów choroby neurodegeneracyjnej rozpoczyna się znacznie wcześniej, zanim się one pojawią. Przebiega często przez wiele lat i bywa bezobjawowy. Pierwsze symptomy pojawiają się gdy znacząca liczba neuronów ulegnie uszkodzeniu, bądź uszkodzenie dotyczy określonej części ośrodkowego układu nerwowego. Jedną z chorób neurodegradacyjnych jest choroba Alzheimera . Dotyczy głównie osób po 65. roku życia i dotyka 5-7% populacji. Czas jej trwania wynosi ok. 8-14 lat. Specyfiką choroby jest stopniowe i nieodwracalne zaburzenie homeostazy organizmu, zaburzenia procesów poznawczych i postępujący zanik pamięci, który prowadzi do zaburzeń orientacji wzrokowo-przestrzennej. Pojawiająca się apraksja skutkuje niemożnością posługiwania się przyborami codziennego użytku. W późnej fazie otępienie jest bardzo nasilone zaś pamięć często ograniczona jedynie do faktów autobiograficznych. Zaburzenia mowy są na tyle zaawansowane, że chory może wypowiadać pojedyncze słowa. Występują również zaburzenia emocjonalne, przejawiające się apatią lub agresywnością. Zaburzenia obejmują również problemy z przeżuwaniem, przełykaniem i kontrolą zwieraczy. Występowanie choroby w strukturze rodziny wywołuje liczne zmiany oraz wyrzeczenia ze strony jej członków.",

      "abstract": "The nervous system is commonly impacted by chemicals found in nature, elaborated by organisms, or synthesized by chemists. The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "title": "SCN3A- Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder (SCN3A-ND) encompasses a spectrum of clinical severity associated with epilepsy and/or brain malformation. Affected individuals may have (a) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (i.e., intractable seizures with global developmental delays associated with ongoing epileptiform EEG activity) with or without malformations of cortical development; or (b) malformations of cortical development with or without mild focal epilepsy. Some degree of early childhood developmental delay is seen in all affected individuals; the severity varies widely, ranging from isolated speech delay to severe global developmental delay. Infantile hypotonia is common but may be mild or absent in those without DEE. In those with DEE, seizure onset is typically in the first six to 12 months of life. A variety of seizure types have been described. Seizures remain intractable to multiple anti-seizure medications in approximately 50% of individuals with DEE without malformations of cortical development (MCD) and in 90% of individuals with DEE and MCD. Seizures may be absent or infrequent in those without DEE. Brain MRI findings range from normal to showing thinning or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, to various malformations of cortical development. Autonomic dysregulation, oromotor dysfunction leading to the need for gastrostomy tube placement, progressive microcephaly, hyperkinetic movement disorder, and cortical visual impairment can also be seen in those with DEE. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN3A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Empiric treatment of seizures with standard anti-seizure medications (no specific anti-seizure medication has been shown to be more efficacious than another); feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube placement in those with dysphagia; standard treatment for developmental delay / intellectual disability, spasticity, hyperkinetic movements, autonomic dysfunction, and central visual impairment. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters; evaluation for signs/symptoms of a movement disorder or autonomic dysfunction; monitor for new seizures or changes in seizures; assessment of developmental progress, educational needs, behavioral issues, mobility and self-help skills; annual ophthalmology evaluation to assess for visual impairment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: There is no evidence that specific anti-seizure medications can worsen seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. There is no evidence that sleep deprivation or fever exacerbate seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment. Pregnancy management: Use of anti-seizure medication during pregnancy reduces the risk for mortality during pregnancy, but exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). The risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from anti-seizure medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling SCN3A-ND is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of probands diagnosed with SCN3A-ND have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the SCN3A pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the SCN3A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "The origin of degenerative diseases of the central nervous system lies in genetic and acquired disorders. Analysis of the clinical characteristics of diseases affecting specific neuronal systems may help us to understand their pathogenesis. The stereotyped symptomatology characteristic of most degenerative diseases results from neuronal death in specific pathways: pyramidal tract and motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, nigrostriatal dopamine system in Parkinson's disease, posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord in Friedreich's ataxia, etc. This suggests that these neurons are sensitive to pathological processes that are still unknown. Progression of the disease, whether linear or not, is slow, but it is more rapid than similar effects due to ageing. This indicates either that the environmental cause of degeneration (if it exists) is continuously present or that a vital process has been once and for all disrupted, perhaps at the level of the genome, causing insufficient production of essential proteins, or accumulation of eventually toxic metabolites. Symptoms generally appear during adulthood, i.e. after normal differentiation has taken place, and after a considerable number of neurons have already been damaged. The initiation of neuronal death precedes the appearance of the first symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe, chronic, and recurring mental disorder, which is frequently accompanied by co-occurring mental and somatic illnesses. Compelling evidence indicates that patients with MDD exhibit cognitive impairment encompassing several domains, including but not limited to, executive function, verbal memory, and attention. In addition, cognitive impairment may be evident even during remission and appears to play a major role in the persistence of psychosocial dysfunction (including impairment in workforce). Therefore, several compounds have been tested as putative cognitive enhancers for MDD. Although antidepressant treatment may be associated with modest improvements in some cognitive domains (namely psychomotor speed and delayed recall), evidence thus far remains unclear owing to methodological limitations across clinical trials. These methodological limitations include: (i) lack of adequate screening for cognitive dysfunction at baseline; (ii) the inclusion of samples that were not in remission at baseline; pseudospecificity (i.e. observed effects on cognition could be due to secondary improvement in mood); (iii) cognitive function was not the primary outcome in some trials; and (iv) lack of standardization of cognitive measures employed across studies. Replicated evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that vortioxetine and duloxetine may have procognitive effects. Furthermore, data from RCTs suggest that lisdexamfetamine, modafinil, metformin, and erythropoietin may also have beneficial cognitive effects. In conclusion, the achievement of cognitive remission remains an unmet goal in the treatment of MDD. Future research directions, including methodological improvements in the conduct of RCTs targeting MDD-related cognitive dysfunction, are discussed.",

      "title": "Therapeutics for the Treatment of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

Progressive brain damage can lead over time to a dementia syndrome. The diagnosis of cognitive deficits is of prime importance since it helps to optimize patient care and to decrease failure in re-insertion programs. Here we propose several screening tests which should give the practitioner the opportunity to make a basic cognitive assessment and to decide whether a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation is indicated. In alcohol addiction cognitive impairment is dominated by executive dysfunction of varying severity, which is also characteristic of alcohol dementia.",

La Liga Internacional Contra la Epilepsia define al estado epileptico como una condicion resultante de la falla de los mecanismos responsables en la terminacion de una crisis o en la iniciacion de otros que conducen a crisis anormalmente prolongadas. El criterio del tiempo minimo para definir «estado epileptico» se redujo de 30 a cinco minutos, delimitado como actividad convulsiva continua o convulsiones recurrentes rapidas sin recuperacion de la conciencia durante mas de cinco minutos. Esta definicion considera que las crisis que persisten durante mas de cinco minutos probablemente lo haran durante mas de 30. El «estado epileptico refractario» es una crisis convulsiva que continua a pesar del tratamiento con benzodiacepina y medicamento antiepileptico. «Estado epileptico super refractario» es el que no responde a la medicacion anestesica o la recaida durante el retiro de estos farmacos. El estado epileptico se puede clasificar clinicamente en convulsivo, no convulsivo o refractario. Una vez hecho el diagnostico de estado epileptico, el tratamiento debe iniciar inmediatamente y debe tener los siguientes objetivos: terminar el evento, prevenir recurrencias, manejar las causas precipitantes y las complicaciones. El objetivo de esta revision es proporcionar y actualizar los conceptos, fisiopatologia, etiologia y tratamiento antiepileptico disponible del estado epileptico, asi como proponer un esquema de manejo racional",

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

Few of these neurotoxins act directly on neural cells, whereas others impair metabolic processes heavily reliant on the neurological system. Neurotoxicity can occur as a side effect of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, drug therapies, organ transplantation, and vulnerability to heavy metals such as mercury and lead, certain foods, pesticides, industrial products, and solvents used in cleaning cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products. Additionally, there are a few naturally occurring compounds. Symptoms of intoxication may begin to develop immediately upon exposure or may take time to manifest. These symptoms may include encephalopathy, limb weakness or numbness, cognitive and behavioral impairments. Following the elimination or decrease of exposure to hazardous chemicals, symptomatic and supportive therapy is provided. The prognosis is highly variable and depends on the duration and depth of vulnerability and the degree of the neurological impairment. Neurotoxicant vulnerability can be lethal in rare instances. Patients may survive in some cases despite their failure to heal completely. In other cases, many individuals recover completely following treatment.",

Several neurochemical and molecular changes take place in the brain during the first phase of drug use which lead to dependence, addiction and drug abuse. DEVELOPMENT. Every drug of abuse acts through similar neurophysiological mechanisms, mostly based on the abnormal activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Although the addicted brain tries to adapted to the drug action, there are permanent neural changes at the cellular and molecular levels which seem to underlie the addictive process and the emergence of abstinence symptoms after drug taking stops. Furthermore, these neural changes appear to subserve the emergence of cravings once the abstinent syndrome has been overcome. Cravings are the main factor leading to relapse, and they are often initiated by exposure to drug related cues.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

These patients are difficult to assess because of the severity of their weakness and any accompanying encephalopathy. It is essential to undertake a meticulous review, including assessment of any septic, hypoxic or metabolic derangements and a detailed look at the dosage and duration of medication including antibiotics, neuromuscular junction blocking agents and sedation. If a primary underlying neurological cause or an intercurrent event have been excluded, the likeliest cause of weakness is one of the neuromuscular complications of critical care such as: critical care polyneuropathy, an acute axonal neuropathy which develops in patients with preceding sepsis or multi-organ failure; the use of neuromuscular junction blocking agents or steroids; and critical illness myopathy, which is the most common cause of critical care related weakness.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Neuromuscular weakness is common in the setting of critical illness. Over the past two decades, it has been recognized that polyneuropathy or myopathy may develop de novo as a complication of the underlying illness, sepsis, or the medical therapies. This weakness complicates recovery and often contributes to prolonged ventilator dependence. REVIEW SUMMARY The neuromuscular complications of critical illness include critical illness polyneuropathy, an acute myopathy, and prolonged pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade. As a complication of critical illness and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (usually produced by sepsis), an axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy may be seen. A myopathy, often called acute quadriplegic myopathy, may develop in a similar setting, often in association with the use of corticosteroids and/or nondepolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs). Weakness in this latter disorder may result from electrical inexcitability of muscle due to altered membrane sodium channels with reduced sodium currents and loss of myosin thick filament. Some patients, particularly those with abnormal renal or hepatic function, may have prolonged weakness for as long as one week after the use of NMBAs. This large, heterogeneous group of patients are difficult to evaluate due to the limitations imposed by the critical care setting and may have critical illness polyneuropathy, acute quadriplegic myopathy, or both. CONCLUSIONS Neuromuscular weakness may occur in association with a combination of risk factors, including sepsis and multiorgan failure (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), high-dose corticosteroids, and NMBAs. This may take the form of an axonal polyneuropathy, an acute myopathy, or both.",

Cognitive impairment after severe injury is likely to include impaired speed of information processing, poor memory and executive problems. Personality change may include poor motivation, and a tendency to be self-centred and less aware of the needs of others. Patients may be described as lazy and thoughtless. Some become disinhibited and rude. Agitation and aggression can be very difficult to manage. Anxiety and depression symptoms are quite frequent and play a role in the development of persistent post-concussion syndrome after milder injury. Depression may be associated with a deterioration in disability over time after injury. Psychosis is not unusual though it has been difficult to confirm that traumatic brain injury is a cause of schizophrenia. Head injury may, many years later, increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Good rehabilitation probably minimizes the risk of psychiatric sequelae, but specific psychological and pharmacological treatments may be needed.",

However the broad subdivision into convulsive SE and non-convulsive SE is still useful in clinical practice when emergency treatment is required. The neuropathological changes are largely determined by the nature (excitory or inhibitory) and the duration of the event which originated the crisis. Tonic-clonic SE is only one of many variants of SE. However, unlike many others, it is a medical emergency which if not suitably treated may lead to permanent neurological damage. Neurone damage and death are the result of a series of parallel processes occurring at a systemic and neuronal level. Outstanding amongst the latter is the activation of a complex neurotoxic cascade. Better understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms occurring in SE would set the stage for a more logical use of treatment.With advances in the treatment of SE in recent years the prognosis of these patients has improved considerably. However, we should now consider the use of conventional anticonvulsant drugs alone to be insufficient, and that this should give way to polytherapy with neuroprotector agents.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION \nEl envejecimiento de la poblacion esta causando un aumento en la aparicion de patologias asociadas a la edad, como es el caso de las demencias. Afortunadamente los avances de las Ciencias de la Salud como la Medicina, la Psicologia y, en particular, la Neuropsicologia estan aportando herramientas de gran utilidad para la evaluacion, el diagnostico y el tratamiento de procesos como el Deterioro Cognitivo Leve (DCL) y la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA).\nEl Deterioro Cognitivo Leve es definido como un sindrome clinico caracterizado por la alteracion adquirida en una o mas areas cognitivas (atencion, funciones ejecutivas, lenguaje, memoria o area visuoespacial) con una duracion de meses a anos, que sin cumplir los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia excede a lo esperado por la edad. La afectacion es referida por el propio paciente o por un informador y debe ser objetivada en la exploracion neuropsicologica, pudiendo provocar una interferencia minima en el desarrollo de las actividades habituales. El DCL es frecuentemente ubicado en un continuo que transcurre desde el envejecimiento normal hasta la enfermedad de Alzheimer, considerando a las personas con DCL como un grupo poblacional con alto riesgo de padecer posteriormente demencia (predominantemente Enfermedad de Alzheimer).\nLa Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) ha sido la demencia mas estudiada y aunque su evolucion es heterogenea, la afectacion cognoscitiva mas grave en los primeros estadios es la alteracion de la memoria. La EA se caracteriza por un comienzo insidioso, dificultando la discriminacion y la realizacion de un diagnostico temprano. Conforme avanza la enfermedad otras areas cognitivas se ven gravemente afectadas.\n Por tanto, la definicion del perfil clinico y neuropsicologico asociado a las primeras etapas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es crucial para facilitar la deteccion temprana de la enfermedad, establecer el punto de partida para una intervencion adecuada y poder llevar a cabo un seguimiento de la evolucion de manera controlada.\nOBJETIVO\nEn la presente Tesis Doctoral se analiza el perfil neuropsicologico integral y el curso evolutivo de pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve y Enfermedad de Alzheimer en dos estadios, leve y moderado, atendiendo a la capacidad funcional y cognitiva en tres momentos diferentes de su evolucion, al inicio y a los seis y doce meses.\nMATERIAL Y METODOS\nSe han llevado a cabo cinco estudios basados en una metodologia descriptiva transversal (Estudios I-IV) y longitudinal (Estudio V), mediante la exploracion neuropsicologica integral y clinica de una muestra inicial de 116 pacientes de los cuales 72 se han ajustado a los criterios de inclusion en la fase de valoracion basal y 44 en la fase de evolucion. El protocolo de evaluacion ha estado conformado por los siguientes tests de screening, de funcionalidad y de dominio cognitivo especifico: Examen Cognoscitivo MiniMental, Test de los 7 Minutos, Escala de Deterioro Global (GDS), Escala para las Actividades Basicas de la Vida diaria BARTHEL, Escala de sobrecarga del cuidador de ZARIT, Cuestionario de Actividad Funcional (FAQ) de Pfeiffer y diferentes subtests del Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica-Test Barcelona.\nRESULTADOS\nA nivel funcional, el grupo con DCL inicialmente era independiente en el desarrollo de las ABVDs pero conforme ha transcurrido el tiempo han comenzado a requerir cierta supervision en sus actividades. A nivel cognitivo inicialmente han presentado afectacion principal de las funciones ejecutivas, la memoria diferida y la velocidad de procesamiento, manteniendo preservadas a los doce meses de investigacion el resto de las funciones evaluadas aunque con un descenso en la ejecucion a los seis meses en orientacion temporal y fluencia verbal.\nLos pacientes con EAL han presentado dependencia funcional desde el inicio incrementada a los doce meses. A nivel cognitivo, en la valoracion inicial se han encontrado resultados sugerentes de afectacion en las funciones ejecutivas (planificacion y secuenciacion), memoria verbal (inmediata y diferida) y velocidad de procesamiento. A los seis meses han comenzado a verse afectadas las funciones de span atencional, coordinacion motora, denominacion y comprension lectora y a los doce meses la orientacion temporal tambien se ha visto afectada. Los sujetos han preservado algunas funciones como la orientacion espacial, lenguaje (automatico, repeticion de palabras, comprension auditiva), praxias ideomotoras y abstraccion verbal.\nPor ultimo, los sujetos con EAM han mostrado alteracion funcional inicial y afectacion de casi todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas (orientacion temporal y espacial, abstraccion, planificacion y secuenciacion, control mental, span atencional, repeticion de material verbal extenso, fluencia verbal semantica y fonetica, comprension verbal auditiva y lectora, praxias ideomotoras, memoria y velocidad de procesamiento). A los seis meses se ha afectado tambien la orientacion en persona y la denominacion de imagenes. En la ultima evaluacion todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas han estado afectadas a excepcion de la capacidad para repetir palabras conocidas y logatomos y para emitir series automaticas del lenguaje cuando son requeridas en orden directo.\nCONCLUSION\nLos sujetos con DCL han comenzado a presentar alteraciones clinicas que les conducen a sentir limitaciones clinicas considerables y que son percibidas por el propio paciente y por las personas de su entorno. En el caso de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer, la evolucion de la misma termina por causar afectacion de todas las funciones mentales superiores y conduce al paciente a un estado de dependencia donde requieren una ayuda continua cada dia. Ademas las areas que en estadios mas temprano comienzan a alterarse son las que se han observado dramaticamente mas afectadas en estadios mas avanzados (memoria, funciones ejecutivas y velocidad de procesamiento).\nLa evaluacion realizada en esta investigacion ha contibuido a la definicion del perfil neuropsicologico de los pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer en estadio leve y moderado, facilitando la labor de discriminar la afectacion funcional y cognitiva inicial en los tres grupos de estudio.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer, Perfil Neuropsicologico, Evaluacion Neuropsicologica",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe, persistent fatigue which is not relieved by rest and is not associated to other medical conditions. Other common symptoms are including concentration and memory impairment, muscle and multiple joints pain, extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exertions, irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms and depression, anxiety, mood swings and panic attacks. Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

It refers to a change in cognitive function that is severe enough to compromise an individual's daily function. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) defines dementia as an acquired impairment of cognitive function that includes a decline in memory beyond what would be expected for age and at least one other cognitive function, such as attention, visuospatial skills or language, or a decline in executive functioning such as planning, organization, sequencing, or abstracting. The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia. Dementia can further be defined by a possible, probable, or definite etiologic diagnosis. A degenerative dementia implies disease progression over time.",

Examples of such endogenous molecules include glutamate, bilirubin, nitric oxide, histamine, while alcohol or carbon monoxide represents exogenous insults. Such alterations in the neurons are sometimes not limited to functions, but also involve the anatomy, i.e. the cell structure, of the neurons. The term “neuronopathy” refers to the death (necrosis or apoptosis) of the neuronal cell, and a dead neuron cannot be replaced by new neurons. Types of neurotoxicity other than neuronopathy include axonopathy, myelinopathy, or blockade of the neurotransmission. The duration and intensity of exposure to neurotoxic insult has a significant role on the outcome of the toxic effect. Most of the neurotoxins act by impairing the voltage-dependent ion canals",

The majority of clinical attention has been given to the disorders of consciousness that occur most commonly with severe brain trauma leading to severe arousal/vigilance issues. This chapter provides a discussion of assessment and intervention for disorders of consciousness. Assessment of severe arousal disorders includes behavioral assessment that is guided by structured instruments, such as neurobehavioral rating scales and individualized quantitative behavioral assessment (IQBA). Treatment strategies may vary based on the level of acuity of injury, duration of symptoms of arousal disorders, and availability of institutional resources. Brain trauma, infections, metabolic disturbances, and/or exposure to anesthesia or certain types of medications often results in persistent impairments in ability to focus, sustain attention, and consciously access information about oneself and the environment. These disorders are characterized by intact arousal periods punctuated by confusion secondary to impairments in the ability to attend, process, and encode information.",

Chronic pain is difficult to treat and often the interventions fail. This failure is, in part due to the fact that chronic pains usually result as a manifestation of some chronic degenerative, inflammatory or neoplastic process. As far as the choice of interventions is concerned, the indication for its use may not be well justified, and the choice itself may be determined by the type of specialist and not by the actual clinical picture. The various treatment interventions usually fail due to non- compliance of patients towards the untoward side effect of the systemically used drugs. The patient may not receive the treatment for appropriate time and dosage due to the side effects. Furthermore, indication of specific treatment modality depends upon the evidence of positive effects of the modality, as indicated in various control trials or the related literature2.",

The exceptions are those which mimic psychopathology: akathesia and akinisia. Akathesia resembles anxiety. Akinesia is similar to depression, residual schizophrenia, and demoralization. Differential diagnosis may require interruption of the neuroleptic. Whether neuroleptics can cause depression not associated with akinesia has never been established. The first obligation of the clinician is to be sure that the depressive symptoms are not concomitants of akinesia, before treating with antidepressants which may not be the appropriate treatment. There is no convincing evidence that one neuroleptic drug is more likely to cause akinesia than another, although this had not been studied extensively using a broad definition of akinesia.",

The few case reports and group studies identified indicated that cognitive and neurological impairments appear to follow a progression of decline and progression of recovery model, with the severity of impairment related to the duration and severity of misuse, blood lead levels among leaded petrol misusers, and the duration of abstinence for recovery. By contrast, severe neurological impairment known as lead encephalopathy from sniffing leaded petrol occurred as more catastrophic or abrupt damage to cerebellar processes that may never fully recover.

      "abstract": "Mismatch negativity (MMN), a pre-attentive auditory event-related potential, is a sensitive neurophysiological marker of cortical dysfunction. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which is effective for various psychiatric disorders, may transiently affect cognitive and neurophysiological processes.This case series examined MMN peak latency and cognitive outcomes following ECT in three patients with distinct psychiatric diagnoses: atypical psychosis, treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder (MDD). In patients with atypical psychosis, MMN peak latency was markedly prolonged immediately after two ECT sessions and returned to baseline by 40 days, in parallel with transient cognitive decline and mild delirium. Conversely, the patient with schizophrenia demonstrated no MMN latency changes and stable cognitive scores, suggesting diminished cortical reactivity, possibly due to chronic illness or medication effects. The patient with MDD, assessed after the final two sessions of a 10-session course, exhibited sustained MMN latency prolongation with preserved cognitive function, indicating potential cumulative subclinical neural effects. These findings highlight the diagnostic and temporal heterogeneity of MMN responses to ECT, with MMN alterations not always correlating with cognitive decline. MMN may serve as a sensitive but nonspecific biomarker of neural instability during ECT, offering clinical value for the early detection of cortical vulnerability. Our results suggest that MMN monitoring, especially when interpreted alongside the diagnosis and treatment stages, may complement standard cognitive assessments and inform individualized ECT management.",

When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "abstract": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is characterized by behavioral or cognitive change from baseline for at least 30 minutes with EEG evidence of seizures. Categorized into complex partial status epilepticus (with lateralized seizures), and generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus (bilateral diffuse synchronous seizures), there is debate regarding the diagnosis and morbidity of NCSE. Because EEG is needed for diagnosis, only a high index of suspicion leads to a request for the study, whereas EEG is often unavailable after hours or on weekends. Furthermore, the cognitive changes during NCSE are often incorrectly ascribed to a postictal state, intoxication, psychogenic or psychotic states, and mental retardation. Regarding categorization, present classifications address EEG features but fail to distinguish among depths of coma. Deeply comatose patients (with coma etiologies that themselves carry poor prognoses) are mixed with lightly obtunded patients with no morbidity, confusing the prognosis. Thus, a classification that subsumes depth of coma, and possibly etiology, is sorely warranted. Regarding treatment, comatose NCSE patients treated with benzodiazepines may worsen, whereas generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus patients may suffer iatrogenically from aggressive treatment (hypotension and respiratory depression) necessitating balancing the potential neurologic morbidity of NCSE against the possible morbidity of IV antiepileptic drugs. A high index of suspicion is needed to initiate EEG studies. Better stratification of level of consciousness will be needed to distinguish among morbidity due to underlying conditions, treatment, and the effects of status epilepticus, proper.",

Literature reports varying estimates of prevalence, a variation that relates to the lack of definition and consistency in diagnostic criteria. Primary insomnia (not caused by known physical/mental conditions) responds to pharmacologic therapy, while secondary insomnia(resulting from other illnesses, medications, or sleep disorders) responds to pharmacologic and psychologic treatments (cognitive therapy, relaxation techniques, stimulus control). Use of certain agents in the elderly and patients with abuse/addiction potential is a concern. Medicare Part D does not cover benzodiazepines (classified as controlled substances). Nonprescription agents are affordable but have sedation and anticholinergic side effects. Medication use should be considered a possible contributing factor. Insomnia patients experience significantly more limited activity and higher total health services than those without insomnia. Annual costs are between $92.5 billion and $107.5 billion. A standard definition and better pathways to recognize and treat insomnia are needed.",

      "title": "Deterioro cognitivo leve y reserva cognitiva en una muestra representativa de la población española",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION: El envejecimiento de la poblacion constituye uno de los mayores desafios sociales de nuestro siglo. El impacto del envejecimiento de la poblacion se vera amplificado por un destacado aumento en la prevalencia de los trastornos neurodegenerativos y, muy particularmente, la demencia. La deteccion precoz de la demencia debe constituir una prioridad de la salud publica, no solo por su alta prevalencia, sino por su correlacion con alteraciones funcionales graves, necesidades de atencion a largo plazo, e importantes costos para la sociedad. Esto es especialmente relevante dados los muy limitados exitos terapeuticos actuales en el tratamiento de la demencia, que parecen indicar que el tiempo en que se suele realizar el diagnostico puede ser demasiado tardio para que las estrategias terapeuticas puedan ser efectivas. Es en este escenario donde surgio el termino deterioro cognitivo leve (DCL), entendido como un estado intermedio entre el envejecimiento normal y la demencia, que implica una alteracion de una o varias areas cognitivas que no es esperable para la edad del sujeto ni tampoco cumple los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia. Por otro lado, si bien la esperanza de vida de las personas se ha incrementado considerablemente en las ultimas decadas, se desconoce si estos anos de vida adicionales son vividos en un buen estado de salud y bienestar. Por esta razon, los investigadores han puesto el foco de estudio en las trayectorias y variables que promuevan un envejecimiento activo, y permitan maximizar la capacidad funcional y mantener la calidad de vida en esos anos adicionales. Diversos factores se han asociado a calidad de vida previamente, sin embargo, existen muy pocos estudios que hayan analizado si una mayor reserva cognitiva (RC) conduce a una mejor calidad de vida en personas con edades medias y avanzadas. El hecho de que factores potencialmente modificables a lo largo de la vida como la educacion, la ocupacion y el ocio protejan frente al deterioro cognitivo y funcional, plantearia la posibilidad de que la RC pueda aumentar indirectamente la calidad de vida de un individuo al permitir compensar un determinado deterioro o dano cerebral. OBJETIVOS: Los objetivos de la presente tesis se desglosan de la siguiente forma: a) Estimar la prevalencia de DCL en la poblacion espanola de 50 anos o mas segun el sexo, el grupo de edad (50-64 anos vs 65 o mas anos) y el subtipo de DCL; b) Examinar, de forma transversal, factores psicologicos, cardiovasculares y de estilos de vida asociados a DCL, analizando posibles diferencias en funcion del grupo de edad (50-64 anos vs 65 o mas anos); c) Estimar la tasa de incidencia de DCL en la poblacion espanola mayor de 50 anos segun el sexo, el grupo de edad (50-64 anos vs 65 o mas anos) y el subtipo de DCL, d) Determinar el efecto longitudinal de la depresion sobre el desarrollo de DCL tras un seguimiento a 3 anos, analizando posibles diferencias en funcion del subtipo de DCL; e) Examinar la asociacion entre RC y calidad de vida en la poblacion espanola mayor de 50 anos, analizando posibles diferencias en funcion del grupo de edad (50-64 anos vs 65 o mas anos); f) Explorar si la posible asociacion entre RC y calidad de vida esta mediada por el efecto del funcionamiento cognitivo, el nivel de discapacidad o la presencia de depresion. METODOS: Los datos provienen de los participantes del estudio COURAGE, un estudio longitudinal que ha recogido los determinantes mas importantes del envejecimiento en una muestra nacionalmente representativa de la poblacion adulta espanola. La muestra original esta compuesta por 4753 sujetos mayores de 18 anos, si bien los analisis realizados en la presente tesis se centran en aquellos de 50 o mas anos, y la n final depende de cada objetivo particular. El protocolo desarrollado recoge informacion sobre enfermedades cronicas, salud mental, calidad de vida, bienestar y medidas objetivas de la salud (incluyendo la funcion cognitiva), y determinantes de la salud (consumo de sustancias, actividad fisica, redes sociales, etc.). La muestra fue entrevistada por primera vez en 2011-2012 y posteriormente en 2014-2015. RESULTADOS Y CONCLUSIONES: 1. La prevalencia de DCL es de 9.6% en la poblacion espanola de mediana y avanzada edad, con tasas mas elevadas en edad avanzada y mujeres. La tasa incidencia de DCL es de 33.19 por 1000 personas-ano, con cifras mas altas en edad avanzada y mujeres. 2. La depresion, la diabetes, un bajo nivel de actividad fisica y alteraciones del sueno se relacionan significativamente con mayor presencia de DCL en la muestra total. Al estratificar por grupos de edad, la depresion, el ictus y la obesidad se asocian con DCL en los participantes de mediana edad (50+64 anos), mientras que un bajo nivel de actividad fisica y problemas de sueno se relacionan significativamente con DCL en el grupo de edad avanzada, lo que sugiere que los factores asociados a DCL podrian ser el reflejo de diversas etiologias. 3. La presencia de depresion incrementa el riesgo de desarrollar DCL a los tres anos de seguimiento. Esta asociacion no es significativamente diferente segun el subtipo de DCL (aDCL vs naDCL). 4. Mayores niveles de RC se asocian a una mejor calidad de vida autoreportada en la poblacion espanola de mediana y avanzada edad. Esta relacion queda parcialmente mediada por la depresion, el funcionamiento cognitivo y la discapacidad, siendo este ultimo factor el que muestra una mayor influencia (el 50% de la relacion entre RC y calidad de vida queda explicado por la discapacidad). En su conjunto, estos hallazgos contribuyen a aumentar el conocimiento sobre la caracterizacion del envejecimiento en una muestra representativa de la poblacion espanola. Puesto que se espera que la incidencia de demencia aumente drasticamente en los proximos anos, los profesionales de la salud se enfrentan al desafio de identificar, de forma precisa, a los individuos en las primeras etapas de la enfermedad, asi como los factores de riesgo asociados, como la depresion, que podrian retrasar o incluso prevenir, el inicio del deterioro cognitivo. Ademas, frente al proceso de envejecimiento, las intervenciones dirigidas a los factores modificables que componen la RC, que pueden ser entrenados y estimulados a lo largo de la vida, podrian llevar a un envejecimiento activo prolongando el funcionamiento autonomo de la persona y aumentando asi su calidad de vida.",

      "abstract": "Objective: There is increasing concern that the course of psychiatric disorders may be affected by parameters such as the duration and intensity of symptoms of initial episodes of illness. As this indicates that abnormal function produces long-term changes within the brain, a review of the neuroscience literature regarding neuroplasticity is warranted.Method: This article is a selective review, focusing in particular on results obtained from physiological experiments assessing plasticity within the mammalian neocortex. The possible relevance of results to psychiatry is discussed.Results: While the most dramatic examples of neuroplasticity occur during a critical period of neural development, neuroplasticity can also occur in adult neocortex. Neuroplasticity appears to be activity-dependent: synaptic pathways that are intensively used may become strengthened, and conversely, there may be depression of transmission in infrequently used pathways.Conclusions: Results from neurophysiological experiments lend support to the clinical observation that the intensity and duration of a psychiatric disorder may adversely alter its long-term course. Rapid aggressive treatment may prevent this from occurring. While pharmacotherapy may reduce the duration and severity of symptoms, it may also have an independent, as yet unknown, effect on neuroplasticity.",

Neuroses are one of the most widespread neuropsychiatric diseases in the world. At the present stage, they are also distinguished as an occupational disease in accordance with the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The etiological factor in the development of neuroses is a single or prolonged exposure to mental traumas that carry negative or problematic information. The strength of the impact on the psyche is determined not by the physical intensity of the signal, but by the significance of the information. The main factor contributing to the development of the disease is the individual psychophysical characteristics of a particular person. The symptoms of neuroses are divided into two main groups: somatic and psychopathic. Symptoms of neurosis are always present for a long time. They are often painfully perceived not only by the patient, but also their environment, thereby impairing the quality of life of many people both in everyday life and in production conditions. The main clinical forms of neuroses are neurasthenia, hysterical neurosis and obsessional neurosis. The diagnosis of neuroses is based on data from the clinical picture, occupational history, professional journey and additional examination methods that allow you to exclude somatic pathology. Neuroses are easier to prevent than to treat, so their prevention is of great importance. The main areas of neuroses treatment are psychotherapy and other non-drug and drug therapies. Working capacity in neuroses largely depends on the patient’s interest in continuing their work. Determining the degree of disability also depends on the severity of the pathological process.",

      "title": "Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy: Metastability in a Dynamic Disease?",
      "abstract": "Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a rare condition in which seizures predominantly occur during sleep. Little is known about what triggers the seizures, and why they terminate once they have begun. The seizures only occur during certain stages of sleep, suggesting that two time scales may be involved in the development of a seizure: a slow time scale for changes in macroscopic brain states (i.e. stages of sleep), and a fast time scale related to the events of the seizure itself. One approach to the issue is to consider it from a dynamical systems standpoint. As axonal conduction velocities on a neuron are finite, the dynamics of neural populations are subject to a time delays, and thus systems of delay differential equations (DDEs) are typically used model nervous system function [1]. Unique to DDEs is the existence of long-lived oscillatory states on the separatrix between two stable attractors, called metastability [5]. These transient states and their behaviors are not well understood, though their durations have been found to be influenced by noisy perturbations as are observed in the human brain [3, 2]. Viewing the problem within this framework, we hypothesize that the seizures observed in NFLE correspond to metastable states. In this context, the stable attractors correspond to different macroscopic brain states, and the metastable state exists on the boundary between them. These stable attractors, however, are not always both present, and it is during the transition from one stage of sleep to another, that more than one attractor is present and a transient metastable state (i.e. a seizure) is possible. This transition between states is implemented mathematically by slowly changing the parameter values of the model. The implication of this is that an individual is only prone to a seizure when transitioning between stages of sleep, which is consistent with the observation that seizures only occur during certain stages.",

      "title": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders for mental health professionals - a brief review",
      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "title": "Addiction: Therapeutic possibilities and clinical reality",
      "abstract": "Addiction is a specific psychosocial result of a complex neurobiological process in the existence of individuals. As pharmacologically term addiction arises from creation of physiological adaptation to the substance and with occurrence of withdrawal syndrome in the moment of cessation of both substance intake and effect of the substance. With psychobiological disorders created as a result of such adaptations, addiction becomes the illness of central nervous system. Persistent and compulsive usage is created through forming of long term associative memory in several neural networks including prefrontal cortex. 'Pathological usurpation of neural of learning and memory mechanisms, which normally serve to shape behavior connected to the reward as well as a signal for prediction of reward' Defining one phenomenon with addiction term requires application of medical model. Therefore illness is defined before all with existence of stable pathological signs and symptoms, which are expressed through dysfunction of some organs and followed by individual experience of torment and misery of individuals. Symptoms have to have stable and regular occurrence with large number of patients and make one clinical picture. This allows diagnostics, classification and requires treatment. Outcome of the addiction and future career /destiny of the addict largely is connected with his/her primary bio-psychological potentials and possible other diagnosis besides addiction. Therefore, therapeutic possibilities in treatment of addictions are determined by the use of pharmaco-therapeutic means, but in many cases they are determined by society’s attitude towards psychoactive substance and addicts. Namely, the goals of treatment depend on it, as well as different modalities of rehabilitation and social reintegration of addicts. This paper analyzes forms of treatment and rehabilitation of addicts, it also estimates theoretical forecast of treatment possibilities with realistically realized therapeutic programs.",

      "title": "Sucht und Demenz",
      "abstract": "Regelmäßiger Konsum führt bei vielen Drogen zu leichten kognitiven Beeinträchtigungen, die unter Abstinenz noch einige Zeit fortbestehen können, aber zum großen Teil reversibel sind. Zum neuropsychologischen Vollbild einer Demenz wie auch zu bleibenden strukturellen Hirnschädigungen kommt es hingegen nur selten. Die größten Risiken dauerhafter struktureller Hirnschäden bergen Kokain, Amphetamine und Ecstasy, geringer ist die Gefahr bei Benzodiazepinen, Cannabis und Opiaten. Selbst beim Alkohol ist unklar, inwieweit die reine Alkoholwirkung zu irreversiblen Hirnschäden führt. Dies ist offenbar nur bei dauerhaften sehr hohen Blut-Alkohol-Konzentrationen der Fall, wahrscheinlich wirken häufig Entzugsyndrome verschlimmernd. Bedeutsamer sind die vielfältigen Alkoholfolge- bzw. -begleiterkrankungen. Dasselbe trifft für das Rauchen und Opiate zu. Beim Wernicke-Korsakoff-Syndrom und der HIV-Enzephalopathie handelt es sich nicht um direkte Folgen des Suchtmittels, sondern um indirekte Komplikationen. Die Wernicke-Enzephalopathie verläuft oft oligosymptomatisch bzw. mit „atypischen“ Symptomen, so dass sie sehr häufig nicht erkannt wird und dann unbemerkt in ein Korsakoff-Syndrom mündet. Suchtmittelkonsum und Sucht-Folgeerkrankungen können auf verschiedene Weise im Sinne der zerebralen Multimorbidität zur Entwicklung degenerativer Demenzerkrankungen beitragen. Diese Rolle des Alkoholmissbrauchs als Kofaktor ist epidemiologisch offenbar am wichtigsten, sie wird die mit zunehmendem Alter immer bedeutsamer. Geringfügiger bis mäßiger Alkoholkonsum ist nicht mit einem erhöhten Demenzrisiko verbunden. Schwerwiegender als die kognitiven Einbußen sind möglicherweise die Beeinträchtigungen der Lernfähigkeit durch chronischen Drogeneinfluss, die soziales Lernen, den Erwerb von Copingmechanismen und Stressbewältigungsfertigkeiten behindern und damit zu Persönlichkeitsveränderungen beitragen. Dies gilt bei Langzeitanwendung wohl auch für Benzodiazepine in therapeutischen Dosierungen. Die Gefahren sind umso größer, je jünger und unreifer das Gehirn ist. Außerdem besteht eine deutliche Beziehung zur kumulativen Dosis.",

      "title": "STRESS COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION PREVENTS COCAINE RELAPSE BY DISRUPTING MEMORY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug addiction is a chronic and recurrent brain disease. Addictive substances can cause changes in brain circuits and may be integrated into the memory system. Drug addiction consists of different phases, beginning when recreational use escalates to compulsive use and then cycles through withdrawal, and relapse. A relapse is a return to drinking or drug use after attempts have previously been made to stop. The prevention of relapses is perhaps the most fundamental task in addiction recovery. Repeated retrieval by the cue without reward stimulant reduces the behavioral response through a process called extinction. This learning is the fundamental principle underlying many cognitive- behavioral psychotherapeutic treatments. Yet behavioral change may be difficult to sustain, and relapse is not uncommon, even after successful treatment. Memory updating was applied to substance use problems by weakening the ability of drug-associated triggers to elicit substance use[1]. Stress can potentially affect all cognitive phases involved in memory function such as the process of memory storage, retrieval or/and consolidation. Stress prior to extinction might not only enhance the consolidation of extinction memory, like post-extinction stress does, but also make it less context- dependent[2]. Aims &amp; Objectives 1) Whether stress combined with extinction learning disrupts consolidated memory to suppress cocaine relapse. 2) What is the mechanism of stress combined with extinction learning suppressing drug seeking behavior. Method The self-administration of cocaine was used as an animal model for addictive memory. A combination of techniques, including immunofluorescence, fiber optic recording, brain slice patch-clamp recordings, and Golgi staining, was employed to explore the mechanism of stress combined with extinction in addictive memory. Results (1) The drug-priming test following self-administration extinction training suggested that rats exposed to footshock before extinction training (FE group) had a lower number of active nosepokes compared to extinction group (E group). Interestingly, in conditioned place avoidance test, footshock did not elicit an aversive response. (2) Fiber optic recording results showed excitatory neuron in LHb were more active in FE group during drug-priming test. Electrophysiological in vitro results suggested a significant increase in action potential firing and reduction of the threshold of the injected current to trigger the action potential in LHb. (3) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb combined with extinction training effectively facilitated the elimination of cocaine addiction memory and reduced psychological craving. (4) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb increased cfos expression in RMTg. Activation of LHb-RMTg also facilitated extinction and inhibited relapse. Activation of LHb-RMTg circuit could mimic the effect of stress combined with extinction in inhibiting relapse. Discussion &amp; Conclusion This study demonstrateed that stress combination with extinction training may promote the extinction of addictive memory and inhibit relapse by reshaping activity of neurons in the LHb-RMTg circuit.

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, chronic disorder that requires long-term management. Although effective treatments are available, MDD frequently remains undiagnosed. Furthermore, once recognized, treatment duration and dosage are often inadequate and adherence to medication is often poor. However, adequate acute phase treatment of MDD is essential to reduce symptomatology, and improve quality of life and the clinical course. After remission, treatment should be continued for 4–9 months to consolidate the remission and prevent relapse. For patients who do not respond adequately to their initial antidepressant therapy, switching or augmentation of therapy may be necessary. Many patients suffer residual symptomatology, even when classified as being in remission. In addition to the suffering and impairment that this causes, residual symptomatology is associated with a high rate of relapse. Clinicians should strive to achieve asymptomatic recovery both in terms of core symptomatology and psychosocial disability. This requires appropriate treatment at therapeutic doses for a sufficient duration; education and support to promote patient compliance with treatment; and regular monitoring and prompt intervention for patients with symptoms that persist even at subsyndromal levels. In conclusion, there remains considerable scope for improving the identification, treatment and management of patients with MDD.",

Das Erkennen einer Schlafstörung und deren diagnostische Einordnung ist daher von großer Relevanz. Die Behandlung von Schlafstörungen richtet sich nach deren Ätiologie und Intensität. Bei sekundären Insomnien steht immer die Behandlung der Grunderkrankung an erster Stelle. Es kann aber auch eine unmittelbare parallel beginnende, spezifische Therapie der Insomnie begleitend notwendig sein. Vor Beginn einer symptomatischen Pharmakotherapie sollte in jedem Fall die Möglichkeit nicht-pharmakologischer Interventionen geprüft werden. An medikamentösen Behandlungen stehen für die zeitlich limitierte Behandlung primär die Nicht-Benzodiazepinhypnotika zur Verfügung. Bei längerfristig notwendiger Therapie können schlafanstoßende Antidepressiva und auch hypnotisch wirksame Neuroleptika (jeweils ohne anticholinerge Komponente) eingesetzt werden. Klassische Benzodiazepine, Antihistaminika und Medikamente mit anticholinerger Wirksamkeit sind aufgrund des Nebenwirkungsspektrums insbesondere bei längerfristiger Behandlung und bei älteren Patienten zu vermeiden.",

Often, patients are incorrectly treated with antipsychotics under a misdiagnosed psychotic illness, or the disorder remains unconsidered in differential diagnoses despite the patients' immense suffering. First-line treatment is psychotherapy with no current approved drug treatments. Psychoeducation and grounding exercises might be sufficient for mild cases without significant impairment of personality functioning. In patients with more distress and impairment of personality functioning, an affect-focused psychodynamic approach is helpful, which simultaneously deals with impaired affect-tolerance and the massive affect-phobia and detachment.",

Treatment options are thus limited to symptomatic presentations and strive to relieve patients and caregivers of some of the behavioral and psychiatric sequelae that can severely impact the quality of life. In fact, neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia affect virtually all patients with dementia at some time during the disease course and are associated with earlier institutionalization, increased caregiving costs (both financial and otherwise), and worsened disease progression. Unfortunately, pharmacological measures acting on neurocircuitry that may be damaged in the brains of patients with dementia as well as attempts to utilize non-pharmacological, cognition-acting strategies in cognitively impaired patients with dementia may not be as effective as they are for younger, non-demented patients. It is also important to note that improvements in behavioral symptoms (e.g., depression) may be due not solely to a prescribed psychotropic agent but may also be a result of the extra social contact with the treatment team that medication warrants.",

      "title": "Benzodiazepines for prolonged seizures",
      "abstract": "Convulsive status epilepticus is a common emergency condition in paediatric practice. Classically, it is defined as continuous or recurrent seizure activity lasting for longer than 30 min in which the patient does not regain baseline mental status.1 Commonly, intervention is recommended after only 5 min of seizure activity2 as neuronal damage may begin to occur after this period, and the longer a seizure continues, the less likely it is to stop spontaneously.3 It seems likely, however, that mortality and morbidity after prolonged seizures should often be dependent upon underlying aetiology rather than duration of seizure activity.4 Repetitive serial seizures (ie, seizure clusters with return to baseline between events, but occurring frequently enough to be highly disruptive) and non-convulsive status epilepticus are also relatively common in children with epilepsy and are associated with significant morbidity.5\n\nDiazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, the drugs most widely used to stop prolonged seizures, are members of the benzodiazepine family, a class of psychoactive drugs with varying hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties.6 Differences in their affinity for receptor subtypes account for different pharmacological effects, in combination with widely varying pharmacokinetic profiles. These pharmacokinetic differences often impose specific routes of administration and specific formulations for individual members of the benzodiazepine family. The aim of this review is to detail their clinical pharmacology as it relates to their use in the management of prolonged seizures in children.\n\nBenzodiazepines produce their range of effects by modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABAA). The GABAA receptor comprises five subunits; each receptor is assembled from a combination of polypeptides, most commonly two αs, two βs and one γ, although several other subunits exist (eg, δ, e, π, θ and ρ).7 The combination of different subunits governs the …",

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

Adrenal insufficiency is a diagnosis that will not be made unless the clinician maintains a level of suspicion. The decreasing or suppressed adrenal function may be masked until stress or illness triggers an adrenal crisis.An important distinction in these patients is the presence of mineralocorticoid deficiency. Those with secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency will typically have preserved mineralocorticoid function due to the separate feedback systems. Mineralocorticoid levels are regulated by the renin-angiotensin system, independent of hypothalamic or pituitary signals.Another important distinction is the acute versus chronic nature of the disease. Acute adrenal insufficiency patients often present in a critically ill state while chronic presentations can be insidious.",

      "abstract": "The notion that cognitive and behavioural dysfunctions of epileptic origin can be prolonged and with an insidious onset, has meant a radical conceptual change about epilepsy considered so far uniquely as a paroxysmal disorder. Also, these dysfunctions can be the only observable manifestations of the disorder. It is particularly true in some epileptic syndromes with onset in childhood. Epileptic dysfunctions are characterized by a discontinuity in time (intermittent, recurrent), in space (cerebral localization of the dysfunction and its spread). They often have a significant relationship with sleep. These features, with sometimes the existential dimension of some symptoms (intermittent loss of the flux of consciousness, intermittent perceptual distortions or cognitive-emotional dysfunction) are not seen in any other congenital or acquired disorders of the human brain. Longitudinal clinical studies in which the epileptic variable can be directly correlated with the precise study of the cognitive dysfunction (also with increasingly complex methods of brain imaging) are a difficult, relatively new multidisciplinary task, especially in the very young child. Case examples of children followed from early childhood to adulthood will illustrate the diversity of observed cognitive and behavioural abnormalities directly caused by the epileptic activity which can be massive or very discrete. One is only beginning to document precisely the late consequences (or absence of) of some early childhood epilepsies that had a direct impact on developing brain function at some point.",

Cognitive testing is an important component of the clinical assessment to corroborate the history.

Such material may also be stored in the patients' memory even in case of pronounced dementia.

      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

The discrepancies of the clinical findings themselves sometimes demand attention and benefit the patient when they lead to the identification of disturbances which could not at first be recognized.

Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neuropsychological consequences of drug abuse continue to be of considerable importance in neuropsychiatric populations. Many patients consume licit or illicit psychoactive substances in prescribed or uncontrolled ways. This chapter reviews the evidence of various relationships between drug consumption and behavior, with particular reference to the long-term neurobehavioral impact of drug abuse. It is commonly assumed that the abuse of most psychoactive substances results in neuropsychological deficit. Whether this attitude reflects a sense of moral retribution or the belief that repeated trips across the blood-brain barrier must exact their toll is an open question. Certainly, most psychoactive drugs affect neuropsychological functioning acutely. The acute effects can be studied in a straightforward way by administering the drug under study in known dosage to subjects and then comparing either pre-post or drug-placebo performance.",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is a major feature of the illness. Like many of the other aspects of the illness, however, it has not been studied extensively in older patients. Several studies of older patients with a lifetime course of poor outcome and chronic institutional stay have indicated that some patients manifest evidence of profound cognitive impairments on a cross-sectional basis and cognitive and functional decline over longitudinal follow-ups of 30 months or longer. Risk factors for this decline include lower educational attainment and more severe positive symptoms, but do not include more severe symptoms of physical illness. These impairments have been shown to be discriminable from normal age-related changes and from the changes associated with Alzheimer's Disease. In contrast, studies of patients with no history of lifetime institutional stay find no such evidence of either age-related changes in cognitive functioning or longitudinal decline in cognitive or functional status. Since there is accumulating evidence of progressive brain changes over the lifespan in patients with schizophrenia, the course of cognitive deficits in later life will remain an important topic, both for understanding the lifetime course of schizophrenia and for developing interventions aimed at reduction of disability in the illness.",

Because of the effects emotional illness has on cognitive function, normal volunteers are often used in clinical research investigating the effects of psychotropic drugs on memory. This means that drugs are tested in a single dose, or at most a few doses, rather than being administered for months or years as in the clinical situation.

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "Medication adherence is increasingly being recognized as a significant issue in treating geriatric patients. A report by the Institute of Medicine1 identified medication nonadherence as a notable source of medical errors.\r\n\r\nPoor adherence has been shown to decrease the effects of prescribed medications or other treatments and to increase the likelihood of poor outcomes.2 Adherence has been related to intermediate clinical outcomes in several diseases. An increased incidence of adverse events has been linked to nonadherence in the elderly.3\r\n\r\nElders' adherence to prescribed medications is a complex phenomenon that depends on an interaction of medical, medication, personal, and economic factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical factors that affect adherence include cognitive abilities, as well as overall health status (eg, number of chronic conditions).\r\n\r\n\r\nMedication factors related to adherence include the characteristics of the medication (eg, dosing frequency or presence of side effects).\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal factors that affect adherence include: \r\n\r\npersonal beliefs about the condition for which the medication is prescribed (eg, how serious the condition is and how likely the medication is to have a positive effect).\r\n\r\n\r\nindividual cognitive abilities, including memory, overall intellectual ability, organization skills, and health literacy. Health literacy has emerged as an important factor that affects older persons' capacity, for example, to make health care choices.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic factors pertinent to medication adherence include whether patients have insurance or other financial resources to pay for the medication.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients' relationship with their physician as well as the physician's communication style can affect adherence.5\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the older adult with memory problems, we have found that whether patients depend on themselves or a caregiver can have a significant impact on adherence.6 Not all caregivers take responsibility for a patient's medication, and family members' beliefs about a medication can also affect the patient's adherence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluation of elders' medication adherence as a factor in treatment success or failure is thus potentially complex, difficult, and time consuming.",

In recent years,1 a diagnosis of insomnia has also included a report of decreased daytime function associated with the poor sleep at night to differentiate a patient with insomnia from an individual who simply requires less sleep. Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines.

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "It is well documented that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate disturbances in sleep continuity and sleep architecture as well as disrupted circadian rhythmicity. These sleep disturbances are associated with reduced quality of life and social functioning. Insomnia might be secondary to the hyperarousal caused by positive psychotic symptoms. However, in recent years, it has been acknowledged that insomnia often persists beyond adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment. Residual insomnia in schizophrenia, defined as insomnia persisting beyond otherwise adequate antipsychotic treatment, covers a range of insomnia symptoms that could be secondary to other potentially treatable conditions such as medical or psychiatric comorbidity, substance use, use of medication that might interfere with sleep or a primary sleep disorder. A thorough evaluation of the insomnia diagnosis is therefore warranted. This includes a careful patient history and examination that addresses sleep and wake function, as well as common medical, psychiatric and medication-/substance-related conditions. The complex problem of residual insomnia in schizophrenia is currently addressed by substituting or adding sedating drugs, but current treatment guidelines suffer from a lack of information on the best clinical practice. Substituting an otherwise efficient antipsychotic drug-therapy with a more sedating drug carries the risk of psychotic relapse during the switch, and adding another drug carries the disadvantages of polypharmacy including increased rate of side-effects, drug–drug interactions, patient non-compliance and medication errors. To investigate the evidence base for the different treatment options in residual insomnia in schizophrenia, we performed a systematic literature review. We searched the major bibliographic databases for randomized clinical trials (search terms: sleep and schizophren*) supplemented by review of reference lists of relevant articles. We found only five randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacological treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Two trials examined the efficacy of switching antipsychotic drug to, respectively, risperidone 1 or its active metabolite, paliperidone 2. The data suggest that risperidone might be a good choice for this particular indication, but methodological limitations and the lack of comparison with other second-generation antipsychotics weaken the suggestion. Three studies evaluating the efficacy of melatonin showed improvement in certain sleep characteristics (e.g. sleep duration and sleep efficiency) 3-5, but two of the studies 3, 4 came from the same group of researchers presumably using the same sample of patients. We found no published randomized clinical trials investigating non-pharmacological treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Thus, our attempt to review this clinically important subject was limited by the few interventions tested experimentally and difficulties making a thorough comparison of the tested interventions due to methodological limitations. These included small sample size, selective reporting, lack of specification of primary outcome measure and a high level of variability regarding assessment tools and allowed comedication. The benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) are frequently prescribed as hypnotics, but they have not been investigated for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. These drugs are generally only recommended for short-term therapy due to the development of tolerance and dependence. Because residual insomnia in schizophrenia is a chronic condition, these drugs are generally not recommendable. An additional reason to avoid prescription of benzodiazepines is their deteriorating effect on cognitive function and their impairment (rather than correction) of sleep architecture. Particular care should be taken in patients' comorbid for a sleep-related breathing disorder or a comorbid history of alcohol or drug abuse. Other possible treatment options mentioned in the literature, but not systematically investigated in schizophrenia, include add-on treatment with drugs with antihistamine properties including various antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines. They are extensively prescribed (or sold over-the-counter for some antihistamines), but scarce evidence exists regarding efficacy, tolerability and safety when used off-label as hypnotics. The use of classic antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) is limited by anticholinergic (including cognitive impairment) and cardiovascular adverse effects. Some evidence suggests the use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone (tricyclic antidepressants) as efficacious hypnotic drugs in primary insomnia and not associated with tolerance, weight gain or abuse potential. However, they have only been sparsely investigated in insomnia not associated with depression and are not available in all countries. The addition of a low-dose quetiapine as hypnotic agent has gained widespread acceptance without any evidence base of randomized controlled trials to support its use. Observational studies have found that even the low doses are associated with the development of adverse metabolic effects. In conclusion, the evidence base is currently too scarce to extract any valid clinical recommendations regarding the treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluation of the switching and augmenting strategies currently applied in clinical practice and also on evaluation of psychological behavioural treatment methods. The latter is especially important in this vulnerable population of patients already chronically medicated. The authors report no financial or other relationship relevant to the subject of this article.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. In most individuals, the symptoms of the disease begin with mild memory difficulties after the sixth decade of life. Symptoms progress slowly, leading to significant impairment in memory, language, executive function, and other domains of cognition. Eventually, impaired cognitive abilities interfere with complex activities of daily life and ultimately result in the loss of independent function. The diagnosis is typically made in this context on the basis of clinical evidence of dementia with progressive impairment in multiple domains of cognition. Structural neuroimaging is often used in the clinical setting to evaluate for the presence of other pathologies (e.g. cerebrovascular or neoplastic disease). Functional neuroimaging, such as PET or SPECT, may be employed clinically to assist in the discrimination of different types of dementia (e.g. frontotemporal vs. Alzheimer’s dementia). Current treatments are primarily symptomatic, in that clinical trials demonstrate short-term stabilization of cognitive function but not a slowing of the rate of decline. Increasing emphasis is being placed on the development of disease-modifying therapies — drugs that impede the underlying pathophysiologic process of neurodegeneration in AD and, thereby, slow the rate of cognitive decline.",

The deficits in long-term memory are probably the result of a disruption of consolidation of information in memory and not retrieval from memory. The disruption is produced by rapid sleep onset.

During the last decade a chain of research has led to a new insight into the causes and potential alleviation of alcohol craving: Recent discoveries indicate that the brain has receptor sites for naturally occurring opiate-like substances (endorphins and enkephalins) which are produced by the nervous system. Opiates such as morphine or heroin, and some of the metabolic products of alcohol (tetrahydroiso-quinolines), can also attach themselves to these receptors. It has been further discovered that the craving for alcohol is related to a deficiency of the naturally occurring opiate-like substances as well as other neurotransmitter substances. This deficiency can occur genetically or as a result of prolonged stress or long-term heavy drinking. The neurochemical imbalance may be treated chemically, leading to a possible alleviation of the craving for alcohol, especially in conjunction with psychotherapeutic and counseling regimens.",

      "abstract": "Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) or dissociative seizures are found under the umbrella headings of functional/dissociative neurological disorders (FND) in psychiatric classifications (DSM-5; ICD-11). PNES are not characterized by any specific ictal or postictal EEG abnormalities. Patients with PNES can present with motor or non-motor symptoms, frequently associated with a change in the level of consciousness. PNES duration is variable, often longer than that of epileptic seizures. Prolonged PNES, sometimes termed PNES status, involve continuous or repetitive events that exceed 30 min. Prolonged PNES are often misdiagnosed as an epileptic event and are often inappropriately treated with high doses of antiseizure drugs. In this report, we describe two adolescent patients who presented with prolonged PNES characterized by generalized hypertonic posturing and low levels of consciousness. Despite multiple presentation to the Emergency department, and multiple normal video-EEG, the patients were misdiagnosed with epilepsy and were inappropriately treated with antiseizure medications. Both patients presented psychiatric comorbidity, consisting of a major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, social withdrawal, difficulty of social interaction, and anxious-perfectionist personality traits. The episodes of prolonged PNES gradually declined within 18 months in both patients.",

      "abstract": "Encephalopathy related to Status Epilepticus during slow Sleep (ESES) is an age-dependent phenomenon, with usual spontaneous resolution during teenage years. However, cognitive outcome is often more disappointing, with permanent cognitive deficits in the large majority of children seen in later life. Presuming this to be an epileptic encephalopathy, current treatment practices are almost exclusively guided by the effect of the AEDs used on the degree of EEG abnormality in sleep. However, the major goal of therapy in ESES syndrome should in fact be to prevent or reduce associated cognitive and neurodevelopmental deficits. Whether or not the EEG pattern of ESES should be completely suppressed to improve cognition is unknown. Discussions on both diagnostic assessment and outcome of cognitive impairment and behavioral disorders should systematically take into account the complexity of the disorder; not only in terms of the evolution or fluctuations of the EEG patterns but also in relation to the underlying etiologies (at least lesional versus non-lesional) and age at diagnosis. We present a common basic assessment protocol, including the minimum technical requirements for polygraphic recording, and a treatment practice protocol that could both be applied in all centres dealing with this rare form of epilepsy. Such an approach would also allow a comprehensive collection of data prospectively, for a better understanding of the natural evolution of the disorder and an evidence-based evaluation of our practices.",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

      "title": "Sedative-Hypnotics: Addiction and Current Research Status",
      "abstract": "Central nervous system depressants, e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines, have a wide spectrum of activity in human and animals. These depressants produce varying degrees of CNS depression, depending mainly upon the dose used. In small doses, they can alleviate anxiety and/or reduce spontaneous activity; in moderate doses, they induce sleep; with large doses, severe CNS depression progresses to anesthesia, coma or even death. This graded, dose-dependent CNS depression is a common feature of these agents. In addition to causing CNS depression, these agents also possess other pharmacological properties, e. g. muscle relaxation, Anticonvulsant activity, respiratory depression, hypothermia, etc. Tolerance-dependence developing to sedative-hypnotics is a common feature following continuous administration of sedative-hypnotics. Tolerance is defined as a decreasing response to repeated administration of the same dose of a sedative-hypnotic or as a necessary increase of the dosage to obtain the initial response. There are two types of tolerance-one dispositional (pharmacokinetic), the other functional (pharmacodynamic). Dependence is defined as a modification of physiological functions that require continuous drug adiministration to prevent the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Abrupt withdrawal from long-term usage of these drugs may produce anxiety, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscular twitching, hyperthermia, delirium, tremors, convulsions, and death. Evidence accumulated suggests that some of the pharmacological actions exerted by sedative-hypnotics, e.g benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol, may be mediated through the GABA system by mimicking GABAergic transmission. However, the mechanisms of the actions of these agents on the GABA system remain to be elucidated. Benzodiazepines have been demonstrated to have receptors which are parts of the GABAA receptors (GABA benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complexes). Although a definitive barbiturate binding site has not yet been identified, the available evidence strongly suggests that barbiturate binding sites and convulsant binding sites are separate but allosterically affect each other. As far as ethanol is concerned, it is likely that multiple neurotransmitter systems are affected. Therefore, it is still unclear how alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are functionally associated with the GABA system. The evidence summarized demonstrates that the GABA synapse plays an important role in the pharmacologic effects of barbiturates, alcohol and benzodiazepines. There are similarities and differences in the effects of these CNS depressants on the pharmacology and biochemistry of the GABA synapse. The effects of alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines on GABA synapses are different in different brain regions. Furthermore, the results which have been reported in the literature are inconsistent. This may be due to differences in (a) animal models used, (b) brain regions used, (c) protocols used in treating the animals (dose, duration, form and route of administration, etc.) and/or (d) techniques used (pharmacological, biochemical, physiological, etc.)",

      "title": "Degenerative Central Nervous System (CNS) Disease",
      "abstract": "The hallmark of degenerative disorders of the CNS is the progressive loss of previously acquired abilities. In infants and young children, a deceleration in the rate of development is often the first presentation: the child falls progressively behind other children and only subsequently loses previously acquired milestones. When the declining developmental quotient is not due to an extrinsic agent or event or to secondary involvement of the CNS by a generalized systemic disease, neurodegenerative disease becomes a consideration.The acquisition of new developmental milestones does not exclude the existence of a degenerative disorder. In healthy infants, strides in development occur sporadically, with a child often appearing to have reached a plateau for several weeks. Initially, it may be only the prolongation of one of these plateaus that leads to suspicion of a progressive neurodegenerative diseaseMost degenerative CNS disorders can be divided clinically into three groups: gray-matter diseases, white-matter diseases, and system diseases. The gray-matter diseases, which primarily involve the neurons, occur with or without histologic evidence of storage of abnormal metabolic products. They lead to neuronal death and secondary degeneration of axons. In the white-matter diseases, myelin is disrupted, either by the destruction of normal myelin or by the production of biochemically abnormal myelin. The system diseases are a heterogeneous group of conditions involving progressive degeneration of anatomically defined systems, such as the dorsal columns,pyramidal tracts, or cerebellar nuclei. Typically, both neurons and myelin are destroyed in these disorders.The first clinical task in evaluating a child for any neurodegenerative disorder is to document that he or she has lost previously acquired milestones or has a decelerating developmental quotient. In either instance, the most important diagnostic tool is repeated developmental evaluations.The major clinical features that differentiate gray-matter from white-matter diseases are related directly to the functional roles of the neurons and myelin. Neuronal involvement in gray-matter disease leads to the early onset of dementia, the progressive loss of cognitive abilities, and seizures that frequently are myoclonic. The basal ganglia and cerebellar nuclei are collections of neurons, so extrapyramidal and cerebellar signs, such as ataxia, are common. Ganglion cells of the retina are affected in many of the gray-matter disorders, producing pigmentary degeneration of the retina. Abnormal storage of lipid in retinal ganglion cells (eg, in Tay-Sachs disease) makes the perifoveal area look gray and opaque. The fovea, which contains no ganglion cells,appears red by contrast, producing the clinically detected \"cherry red spot.\"The majority of degenerative diseases of white matter stem from biochemical defects resulting in abnormal myelin that breaks down rapidly. These\"dysmyelinating\" disorders are called leukodystrophies. Clinically, the earliest sign of most white-matter degenerations is spasticity. Dementia and seizures can occur, but usually later in the clinical course. Extrapyramidal signs are rare, but involvement of cerebellar pathways can cause ataxia. Rather than the cherry-red spot of gray-matter disease,optic atrophy is the most characteristic ocular change seen in white-matter disease. Some patients even have cortical blindness from demyelination of the optic pathways in the cerebral hemispheres.Each of the so-called system diseases has its own signs and symptoms,depending on the particular neural pathways involved. One such disease is Rett syndrome (RS), which is characterized by a period of normal development followed by the loss of developmental milestones and the onset of stereotypic hand movements akin to those seen with autism, followed by seizures and dementia. RS affects girls, probably exclusively, and occurs worldwide. Although most cases are sporadic, the disease has long been suspected of having a genetic basis. Recent genetic advances suggest that the gene for RS is located on the distal arm of the X chromosome.Clinical criteria alone can point to a diagnosis of RS. Usually the antenatal and birth histories are normal, but most girls affected with RS pass through four predictable stages:Stage 1 (birth to ∼18 mo):Deceleration of head growth, beginning between 2 and 4 months of age, results in an acquired microcephaly. This insidious failure of brain growth can be missed if head circumference is not meticulously measured and plotted at health supervision visits. Early in the disease, babies show decreased interest in their environment and become markedly hypotonic.Stage 2 (∼1 to 2 y): The loss of both expressive language and gross motor milestones, and the onset of abnormal hand movements, seizures, irritability,and insomnia are typical of progressing RS.Stage 3 (2 to 10 y): Severe mental retardation, seizures, and persistent stereotypic hand wringing movements characterize the childhood phase of RS. Most patients develop ataxic and wide-based gaits, but many affected girls never walk. Tremulousness is a common finding, as are breath-holding spells. Many children who have RS are misdiagnosed as having Angelman syndrome or ataxic cerebral palsy.Stage 4 (older than 10 y): As girls who have RS approach adolescence,they develop progressive scoliosis,muscle wasting, and can become wheelchair-bound. By the early teenage years, they reach a plateau in their neurologic regression, but death usually occurs during late adolescence from infection or cardiac arrhythmia.Many disorders that have different etiologies may resemble neurodegenerative diseases in clinical presentation:hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, mass and structural lesions of the brain,chromosomal defects, poorly controlled seizures, environmental deprivation,subdural hematomas, and congenital and chronic infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus. Neurodegenerative disorders, unlike these others,are predominantly hereditary. Although the biochemical basis of many neurodegenerative disorders is not fully understood, a precise biochemical diagnosis always should be sought to make possible an accurate discussion of prognosis, to provide counseling, and sometimes to administer specific treatment.Over the past decade, the availability of molecular genetic testing has improved the accuracy of diagnosis in symptomatic patients, prenatally when genetic risk has been identified, and for carrier testing. Many neurodegenerative disorders can be diagnosed by biochemical testing of blood or urine without invasive procedures to obtain tissue for direct examination. Even so, a diagnosis of an altered enzyme disease should be confirmed histologically.In general, treatment is available for only a few of the neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, most remain invariably fatal by late childhood. Dietary therapy, restriction of a substrate or substrate precursor, modification of enzyme activity with cofactor vitamin therapy, and enzyme replacement all have been attempted with only limited success. Hope for more effective treatment comes from developments in molecular genetics that may allow the repair of specific point mutations in the human genome.In 1966, Rett described a syndrome of cerebral atrophy and hyperammonemia that appeared to affect girls exclusively. Experience has shown that elevated ammonia levels are an exception rather than the rule, and no other laboratory or imaging test provides diagnostic confirmation. Once again, we are thrown back on our clinical skills. Girls who have RS develop normally through the first few months of life, until their brains begin to atrophy, leading to acquired microcephaly. They progress to gait apraxia and truncal ataxia, autistic-like behavior, loss of cognitive function, rather typical\"hand-washing\" movements, seizures,and pyramidal tract signs. The dementia is devastating.We usually think of X-linked disorders, which RS appears to be, as primarily affecting boys: factor VIII deficiency,glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Whereas these disorders are recessive, RS may well be inherited dominantly and be lethal to boys because they have only one X chromosome. Hopefully,as Dr Rich remarks, advances in our understanding of the molecular genetics of neurodegenerative disorders like RS will lead to effective treatment.",

Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.",

      "abstract": "Depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) is a severely under-studied mental disorder, regardless of being relatively as prevalent as other serious mental illnesses (SMI) to the general population, such as schizophrenia and obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD). Due to the nature of the current body of work on the disorder, it's clear there is a need for further research, as there are only a few small scale studies that approach the contradistinction in symptomatology between varying onset triggers. This paper proposes an investigation into whether there is a distinction in severity, duration, and persistence of symptoms between individuals with DPDR triggered by drugs versus non-drug induced cases. The proposed study hypothesizes that symptoms in drug induced individuals will be significantly different from cases induced by other triggers. The outcome of symptoms may depend on many factors, a few such as whether or not an individual continues to experiment with drugs following the development of DPDR, running the risk of re-exposing themselves to a severe episode, whether or not symptoms rooted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) retrigger dissociative episodes, and the potential of co-occurring hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) causing symptoms of perceptual disturbances. The proposed study will use a survey design to collect data from 175 participants, targeting individuals who are currently experiencing DPDR or DPDR-like symptoms, or have recovered from the disorder. Given that significant evidence of distinction is uncovered, this study may be the stepping stone to addressing and developing treatment options for DPDR sufferers in the future.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is necessary for normal growth and development. Lack of sleep causes considerable personal impairment that may impose a substantial societal burden on productivity and quality of life. Insomnia, whether transient or chronic, responds to both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Cognitive behaviour therapy can effect sustained improvement in insomnia but requires motivation and commitment on the part of the patient and a trained therapist to guide the process. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists and benzodiazepines reduce sleep latency and increase total sleep time in insomniacs. However, their effects are not sustained after stopping the medication. Long-term safety of these medications has not been formally established. Combination of psychological and pharmacological therapies reduces the effect of psychological interventions. Thus, in determined patients psychological therapy should precede drug therapy.",

Feeding disorder may present as a child refusing to eat a certain group of foods or a specific food element class. The child can manifest with crying, vomiting, choking, or spitting up during feeds. It requires a comprehensive assessment of medical, psychosocial, feeding skill-based systems and associated nutritional based complications. Gastrointestinal disturbance in children with neurodisability (e.g., cerebral palsy) reflects the interplay between the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), resulting in a mandatory comprehensive review of child pathology. Feeding disability is acute when the duration is less than three months and chronic when greater than three months have elapsed.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of dementia increases with age. In rare cases, people younger than 65 years old are also affected, with substantial consequences for the professional life. The symptoms depend on the form of dementia and can vary individually. Impairment of short-term memory is not always in the foreground and other neurocognitive domains, such as the disturbance of executive functions can have a significant impact on the ability to cope with everyday life. Pathophysiologically, neurodegenerative dementias with the major forms of Alzheimer's dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia are distinguished from vascular dementias. Mixed forms are common. There is no curative treatment, but progression can be slowed by nonpharmacological measures and, especially in Alzheimer's dementia, by pharmacological treatment. Appropriate measures can promote independence and autonomy for as long as possible; however, in the course of the disease restrictions in the extended activities of independent living will initially occur, such as banking transactions, use of means of transport and, in the further course, also in the basic activities of daily living. Legal capacity and the ability to consent to health interventions are restricted sooner or later; however, this must always be evaluated for the specific situation and is not generally the case with the diagnosis of dementia. Instruments such as living wills, identification of a health care proxy, and advanced care planning should be used at an early stage. To decrease family caregiver burden with the increased risk of developing depression, supportive, accompanying measures and education are of great importance.Demenzen treten mit zunehmendem Lebensalter vermehrt auf. In seltenen Fällen sind auch jüngere Menschen betroffen, mit erheblichem Einfluss auf die Berufstätigkeit. Die Symptome hängen von der Demenzform ab und können individuell unterschiedlich ausgeprägt sein. Nicht immer steht die Störung des Kurzzeitgedächtnisses im Vordergrund, vielmehr können andere neurokognitive Domänen wie die Störung der Exekutivfunktion sich erheblich auf die Alltagsfähigkeit auswirken. Pathophysiologisch werden die neurodegenerativen Demenzen mit den wichtigsten Formen Alzheimer-Demenz, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz und frontotemporale Demenz abgegrenzt von den vaskulären Demenzen. Mischformen sind häufig. Eine kurative Therapie besteht nicht, die Progression kann jedoch durch nichtpharmakologische Maßnahmen und, insbesondere bei der Alzheimer-Demenz, auch durch pharmakologische Therapie abgebremst werden. Es gilt, die Selbstständigkeit und Autonomie betroffener Patienten zu fördern. Im Verlauf kommt es jedoch zunächst zu Einschränkungen in den erweiterten Aktivitäten der selbstständigen Lebensführung wie Bankgeschäften, Nutzung von Verkehrsmitteln und im weiteren Verlauf auch den basalen Funktionen der Selbsthilfefähigkeit. Geschäftsfähigkeit und Einwilligungsfähigkeit in Bezug auf gesundheitliche Eingriffe sind früher oder später eingeschränkt. Dies muss jedoch immer wieder für die konkrete Situation evaluiert werden und liegt nicht grundsätzlich mit der Diagnose Demenz vor. Frühzeitig sollten Instrumente wie die Patientenverfügung, Vorsorgevollmacht oder vorausschauende Gesundheitsplanung („advance care planning“) genutzt werden. Pflegende Angehörige sind häufig stark belastet und haben ein erhöhtes Risiko, an einer Depression zu erkranken. Daher sind unterstützende begleitende Maßnahmen von großer Bedeutung.",

Each patient was matched for age, sex, severity and duration of illness, and pharmacological treatment, with a parkinsonian patient without cognitive impairment. Results suggest that cognitive deficits are not static but rather there is a progression in the severity. Furthermore, patients suffering from severe dementia are more likely to die during the follow-up period. The prognosis of Parkinson''s disease seems to be changed substantially by the occurrence of dementia. The natural history of parkinsonian dementia does not seem to differ from the history of other forms of dementia with a progressively disabling course leading to a complete loss of autonomy.",

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

These drugs have demonstrated only modest efficacy for cognitive improvement and progression delay. Given the lack of alternative therapies and the evidence for early pathophysiologic disruptions in cholinergic neurotransmission, cognitive enhancer use in intermediate states (such as mild cognitive impairment) has become an area of study. Further along the cognitive continuum, clinicians face clinical decision-making challenges when using these medications for even mild or moderate stages of dementia, where one must weigh the potentially modest return in benefit versus the significant adverse risks. In addition, ongoing controversy exists regarding continuation or discontinuation of cognitive enhancers in late or end-stage dementia. These medications have also demonstrated some efficacy for use outside of Alzheimer's dementia, and they may have a clinically beneficial effect in treating other forms of dementia.

      "title": "Survey of 100 Epileptics who have not had Seizures for Ten Years or More",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

Although convulsive SE is recognized as a medical emergency, prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with NCSE is often not emphasized because its consequences are thought to be benign. We report 10 patients with persistent neurologic deficits or death after well-documented NCSE in the form of complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). All patients had prolonged CPSE lasting 36 hours or longer, as documented by clinical and EEG findings. Causes for CPSE were preexisting epilepsy with partial and secondarily generalized seizures (3 patients), vascular disease (2 patients), encephalitis (2 patients), and metabolic disease (1 patient); causes were unknown for two patients. Poor outcomes identified included persistent (lasting at least 3 months) or permanent cognitive or memory loss (5 patients), cognitive or memory loss plus motor and sensory dysfunction (3 patients), and death (3 patients). NCSE in the form of CPSE is not a benign entity. Serious morbidity and mortality may occur due to the adverse effects of prolonged seizures and as a result of acute brain disorders that precipitate the seizures.",

Careful assessment of patients is necessary to determine whether a co-occurring disorder is due to substance use or a separate diagnosis that requires independent treatment. Many depressive symptoms may resolve with treatment of the substance use disorder. Independent mood disorders can be treated with behavioral therapy and standard pharmacological therapy. Some mood disorder medications are also effective for substance use disorders.

Cognitive deficits in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) contribute significantly to occupational and functional disability. Notably, cognitive subdomains such as learning and memory, executive functioning, processing speed, and attention and concentration are significantly impaired during, and between, episodes in individuals with MDD. Most antidepressants have not been developed and/or evaluated for their ability to directly and independently ameliorate cognitive deficits. Multiple interacting neurobiological mechanisms (eg, neuroinflammation) are implicated as subserving cognitive deficits in MDD. A testable hypothesis, with preliminary support, posits that improving performance across cognitive domains in individuals with MDD may improve psychosocial function, workplace function, quality of life, and other patient-reported outcomes, independent of effects on core mood symptoms. Herein we aim to (1) provide a rationale for prioritizing cognitive deficits as a therapeutic target, (2) briefly discuss the neurobiological substrates subserving cognitive dysfunction, and (3) provide an update on current and future treatment avenues.",

The true incidence of this discontinuation syndrome is unknown because it may be underreported as a consequence of underrecognition or misattribution. This article examines the possible etiology, nosology, mechanisms, and other aspects of the syndrome. Data Sources and Study Selection: A PubMed search was conducted in May 2003 and repeated in January 2004 using the search terms antidepressant and mania. Relevant articles containing adequate descriptions for presentation were retrieved, and their reference lists were hand-searched for further pertinent material. Hand-searches of the indexes of leading psychiatry journals were also performed for the years 1998-2003. Twenty-three articles were identified for review. Conclusions: Antidepressant-withdrawal hypomania or mania may occur rarely with almost any antidepressant drug after sudden withdrawal, tapered discontinuation, or even merely a decrease in dose. The syndrome may be self-limiting, may abate with the reinstitution of the antidepressant drug, or may require specific antimanic treatments; mood stabilizers do not necessarily protect against the syndrome. The true incidence of the syndrome is unknown. Narrow and broad diagnostic criteria are proposed for the syndrome, and a synthesis of literature is provided.",

Residual cognitive effects were observed in some but not in all tests after prolonged heavy cannabis use. The effects were mostly mild. The relationship of cannabis use, psychotic effects and schizophrenia was unclear; the cannabis conceivably gave relief, but it also appeared that cannabis caused schizophrenia in young people and (or) enhanced the symptoms, especially in young people poorly able to cope with stress or in whom the antipsychotic therapy was unsuccessful.",

Non-cognitive neuropsychiatric disorders, most commonly stress-related anxiety disorders, are a major contribution to maladaptation in these patients. The present studies of the neurobiology of aging enable one to decipher not only the mechanisms that underlie the physiology of brain aging, but also the factors that influence cognitive aging and aggravate the manifestations of cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative disease. The process of brain aging is known to presume the long-term preservation of functional neuroplasticity that is greatly influenced by different lifestyle factors, such as daily social and physical activities, the pattern and amount of food taken, cognitive activity, and stressful life events. These lifestyle factors are supposedly a potent tool to maintain physiological brain aging and a delayed cognitive diminution in elderly people. At the same time, studies of the possibility of pharmacologically correcting age-related (both cognitive and non-cognitive) impairments are promising to improve everyday function in elderly people.",

      "abstract": "The appearance of the normal electroencephalogram (EEG) changes significantly from birth through the teenage years and remains relatively unchanged until at least age 80. Epileptiform abnormalities on the EEG may be either interictal or ictal. Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a continuous seizure lasting 30 minutes or more, or the occurrence of two or more seizures without full recovery of the baseline level of consciousness. EEG abnormalities that are slower than expected for the age and behavioral state of the patient are referred to as slow-wave abnormalities. Focal slow-wave abnormalities imply a local disturbance of cortical and sometimes adjacent subcortical structures. Generalized intermittent slowing occurs most commonly in diverse encephalopathies. EEG is useful in establishing a diagnosis of brain death; it should be used only when the patient has met all clinical criteria for the absence of any brain or brainstem function due to a known and irreversible cause.",

They can emerge due to genetic factors or abnormalities in the brain or body acquired after birth, or because of faulty or incomplete physical experiences when learning more complex behavior. Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

Attacks may occur as part of diverse demyelinating syndromes: clinically isolated syndromes [e.g., isolated optic neuritis (ON), myelitis, or brainstem syndromes], relapsingremitting MS (RRMS) or secondary progressive MS, or one of the atypical demyelinating disease variants (Marburg variant, tumefactive MS, severe monophasic disorders such as complete transverse myelitis and neuromyelitis optica). The goals of acute treatment are reversal of neurological disability sustained from an attack, arrest of rapidly deteriorating neurological dysfunction, and restoration of function. This may be distinguished from the goals of long-term therapies, such as interferon beta and glatiramer acetate, which are not known to alter the course of an individual attack and its sequelae, but rather to reduce the probability of subsequent clinical and subclinical attacks.",

      "abstract": "Le patologie neurodegenerative associate ai disturbi neuro- cognitivi (DNC) rappresentano una emergenza assistenziale dalle dimensioni epidemiologiche sempre più rilevanti. Tale emergenza è destinata ad aumen- tare in relazione a un progressivo aumento della prospettiva di vita, essendo i DNC correlati con l'età. Se è vero che i DNC si manifestano con una franca alterazione delle funzioni cognitive con impatto funzionale nella vita della persona colpita, è altrettanto vero che il processo patologico inizia, molte volte, prima della comparsa della sindrome clinica. In questo intervallo di tempo, anche a distanza di anni dall'esordio del DNC, possono presentarsi quadri clinici più o meno sfumati di disturbo cognitivo accomunati dall'e- tichetta di \"disturbo cognitivo lieve\" o Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) e di Disturbo Cognitivo Soggettivo o Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD). Una generale sensibilità a queste forme prodromiche è necessaria per: 1) l'impostazione di un quadro di intervento farmacologico, neuropsicologico ed assistenziale tempestivo ed efficace; 2) l'inserimento della persona in trial clinici per la sperimentazione di farmaci per la stabilizzazione della patolo- gia degenerativa. Ad oggi la distinzione tra invecchiamento normale, forme lievi o soggettive e la loro evoluzione in quadri di DNC maggiori avviene attraverso una attenta anamnesi cognitivo-comportamentale ed una accura- ta valutazione clinica compreso un uso attento e competente degli strumenti cognitivi di screening. Tuttavia, negli ultimi anni, un apporto importante è anche stato offerto dalle tecnologie e nello specifico dall'Intelligenza Artificiale (IA), dal Machi- ne Learning (ML) e dal Deep Learning (DL). Questi strumenti si sono dimo- strati accurati e affidabili: 1) nella rilevazione precoce di un DNC; 2) nella prognosi di una potenziale evoluzione di un DNC lieve in maggiore; 3) nella diagnosi differenziale dei DNC. Il presente lavoro ha l'obiettivo di mostrare in che modo l'applicazione dell'IA, del ML e del DL possa contribuire a una più efficace e tempestiva diagnosi dei disturbi neurodegenerativi.",

In the moderate form there is a loss of consciousness for less than five minutes, usually with some retrograde posttraumatic amnesia.

Loss of short-term memory and coordination are the two primary deficits that occur after concussion. An athlete who loses consciousness should not participate again that day; any athlete who remains unconscious for more than several minutes should be hospitalized.

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an unpredictable iatrogenic neurologic emergency condition, mainly arising as an idiosyncratic reaction to antipsychotic agent use. It is characterized by distinctive clinical features including a change in mental status, generalized rigidity, hyperpyrexia, and dysautonomia. It can be lethal if not diagnosed and treated properly. Mortality and morbidity attributed to this syndrome have recently declined markedly due to greater awareness, earlier diagnosis, and intensive care intervention. In most cases, the syndrome occurs as a result of a rapid increase in a dose of neuroleptic, especially one of the long-acting ones. Pathophysiology behind this syndrome is attributed to a dopamine receptor blockade inside the neurons rendered by the offending drug and excessive calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal myocytes. Laboratory tests, although not diagnostic, may assist in assessing the severity of the syndrome and also the consequent complications. The syndrome has been described in all age groups and occurs more in males than in females. Genetics appears to be central regarding the etiology of the syndrome. Stopping the use of the offending agent, cold intravenous fluids, and removal of the causative agent and its possible active metabolites is the cornerstone of treatment. Periodic observation of psychotic patients recently started on antipsychotic medications, especially those being treated with depot preparations, may aid to an early diagnosis of the syndrome and lead to early treatment.",

Depending on several factors, including level of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia, and neuroimaging findings, brain injuries are classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Individuals with moderate to severe injuries have worse cognitive, emotional, and functional outcomes and exhibit a more prolonged recovery than those with mild injuries. Although mild injuries are usually associated with short-term cognitive and emotional difficulties that resolve within weeks, sometimes symptoms persist longer than three months. These prolonged or post-concussion syndrome symptoms are not related to the injury itself but rather are influenced by prior and current psychological symptoms. As individuals with varying levels of brain injury progress through acute, subacute, and chronic stages of their recovery, neuropsychological evaluations are used to assess cognitive and emotional functioning, predict outcomes, and provide treatment recommendations.",

A difference in the histopathological lesion between the two groups might be responsible. Case records from 97 patients with pathologically proven Parkinson's disease were reviewed to determine the pattern of levodopa response. Pathological findings for fluctuating and non-fluctuating cases were compared. Patients with motor fluctuations had a younger age of onset and longer disease course (P < 0.001), although mean age at death was almost the same. Four milestones of advanced disease (frequent falls, visual hallucinations, cognitive disability and need for residential care) occurred at a similar time from death in each group; this interval was not proportionate to the disease duration. There were no significant differences in the severity or distribution of Lewy body or other pathologies. Irrespective of the pattern of levodopa response, patients reach a common pathological endpoint at a similar age, and the duration and manifestations of end-stage disease are alike. A non-linear or exponential time relationship may govern the late clinical and pathological progression of Parkinson's disease.",

It is important to distinguish between addiction to and normal physical dependence on benzodiazepines. Intentional abusers of benzodiazepines usually have other substance abuse problems. Benzodiazepines are usually a secondary drug of abuse-used mainly to augment the high received from another drug or to offset the adverse effects of other drugs. Few cases of addiction arise from legitimate use of benzodiazepines. Pharmacologic dependence, a predictable and natural adaptation of a body system long accustomed to the presence of a drug, may occur in patients taking therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines. However, this dependence, which generally manifests itself in withdrawal symptoms upon the abrupt discontinuation of the medication, may be controlled and ended through dose tapering, medication switching, and/or medication augmentation. Due to the chronic nature of anxiety, long-term low-dose benzodiazepine treatment may be necessary for some patients; this continuation of treatment should not be considered abuse or addiction.",

Detection and monitoring can be limited by contextual level of consciousness (LOC) alterations, cognition, expression, or language deficits. Recent data suggest that existing pain assessment tools may not be applicable to all neurocritically ill patients, especially in those with LOC alterations and atypical pain-associated behaviors. Targeted sedation goals may be neurologically disease specific; for instance, intracranial pressure (ICP) targets will supersede sedation titration by other criteria. Technology such as bispectral index (BIS) may be beneficial in avoiding excessive medication administration in deeply sedated neurologically injured ICU patients. Given the wide variety of pathology in the neurocritically ill patients, it is unclear if delirium can be diagnosed and unequivocally differentiated from symptoms of the underlying neurological pathology. However, delirium symptoms may herald life-threatening primary insult progression or result from a new secondary neurological injury and should be monitored. Patients with neurological injury or illness are often excluded from ICU studies addressing pain, sedation, and delirium, but this need not be the case. We review what is understood in this area based on current evidence.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "abstract": "Depression in the elderly is associated with increased mortality, persistence of symptoms and progression to dementia in a substantial number of cases. Minor cerebrovascular lesions such as deep white matter changes, lacunar infarcts and silent cerebral infarction can be demonstrated in some late-onset depressives and may be relevant to the development of depression, or associated with the persistence of symptoms and the emergence of treatment resistance. Increased morbidity and mortality may occur through subsequent cerebrovascular events, and progression to dementia might result from multiple cerebral infarcts. Treatment strategies that address underlying vascular risk factors could decrease the likelihood of fatal strokes or stepwise progression to (multi-infarct) dementia, thereby improving the long-term prognosis for a subgroup of late-onset depressives.",

      "abstract": "The affective disorders include a variety of conditions characterised by mood changes unrelated to life events, i.e. they are not reactive. There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

Postconcussion syndrome is defined as the persistence of these symptoms beyond 3 months. These initial symptoms can be debilitating and can lead to further physiological or psychological impairments such as depression, slowed processing speed, and gait imbalances. Although pharmacological interventions with antidepressants and stimulants may be useful, some patients may not accept or adequately respond to these interventions. A nonpharmacological approach to treating postconcussion syndrome uses a holistic approach to treat both the mind and body. Nonprescription therapies include vestibular rehabilitation for dizziness, vertigo, and balance/gait difficulties, as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy for both somatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The timing and ratio of rest versus rehabilitation through activity is case specific and a matter of ongoing clinical judgment given the uniqueness of each injury and the variety of postconcussive presentations.

      "abstract": "Seizures and epilepsy commonly occur in patients with organ system failure, either as a consequence of trophic effects on cerebral function or of therapies used in such conditions. Acute organ failure results in an abrupt, but often reversible, lowering of seizure threshold, whereas chronic organ failure results in more pervasive and indolent cerebral compromise, often permanently altering both the seizure threshold and the physiologic responses to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Failure of an organ system is not typically a sudden, all-or-none phenomenon but occurs in stages with variable susceptibility to seizures as the condition worsens or remits. Although the principles of diagnosis and management of seizures in adult and pediatric patients with a specific organ dysfunction are similar, the underlying etiologies and influences of comorbid conditions differ between adults and children. Adult organ failure often involves multiple systems to different extents and is superimposed on other chronic diseases of adulthood. Pediatric organ failure is usually the result of inherited metabolic disorders, infections, and unique pediatric susceptibilities to metabolic effects of medications (Table 1).",

There is also evidence to suggest that cerebral dysfunction, particularly impaired abstracting ability, occurs in that larger population of heavy drinkers who do not go on to develop the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. There is no consistent evidence that long-term marijuana, hallucinogen, or sedative use causes lasting neuropsychological disturbance. The deficits in abstract thinking reported by some LSD studies are similar to deficits others have reported among alcoholics. Since the LSD studies were not controlled for alcohol use, their interpretation is difficult. It appears that cerebrovascular accidents occur more frequently and at a younger age among amphetamine abusers. There is no reliable information about possible other long-term effects of stimulants on the brain per se (i.e., nonvascular complications). Abuse of intravenous narcotics has been associated with case reports of transverse myelitis and encephalitis. It is not known whether this pathology is a direct or hypersensitivity effect of narcotic drugs, of adulterants, or of infection.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive disorder characterized by cognitive and behavioral dysfunction, central to which are deficits in the cholinergic and other neurotransmitter systems. These results in the essential symptoms of dementia, including impairment of memory, judgment, and abstract thinking. The pharmacologic relationships among the various neurotransmitters (e.g., cholinergic, serotonergic, nicotinic, and dopaminergic) are highly complex and are still being investigated. Information on the pharmacologic basis of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in AD has applications to drug therapy. One method of obtaining this information is by pharmacomodeling, using individual or combined drugs. Joint cholinergic antagonism with both muscarinic and nicotinic blockade combines to produce short-term memory impairment, which approximates to mild AD in normal elderly people. This effect is better than that achieved with either agent alone. Mixed cholinergic and serotonergic antagonism has an effect on the cognitive function of AD patients and on depression-related behavior. Dopaminergic dysfunction is linked with the development of hallucinatory and psychotic symptoms and may also be involved in dysfunction of verbal fluency. Combination pharmacomodeling allows the various behavioral and cognitive deficits in AD to be studied and allows models for drug trials to be developed.",

Some of these symptoms are accompanied by peripheral neuropathy. Intoxication, especially alcoholism is often are combined with a malnutrition, such as avitaminosis. Dysautonomic symptoms change successively; at an early stage, drugs or toxins stimulate sympathetic or parasympathetic receptors, while the same receptors are inhibited at a later stage when the concentration of the substances rises in the blood.

      "title": "Tolerance and withdrawal symptoms may not be helpful to enhance understanding of behavioural addictions",
      "abstract": "The importance attached to tolerance and withdrawal symptoms in the conceptualization of addiction reflects the prominence of theories that posit neuroadaptation to the presence of a drug [1], and suggest that drug use persists because of negative reinforcement, i.e. as an effort to avoid the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms [2]. Given that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms do not always occur in addiction, they have not been included in the recent general definitions of addiction [3–5]. However, these phenomena are often incorporated into the conceptualization of behavioural addictions. For example, one model [6] postulates that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms are mandatory for any behaviour to be considered addictive. In behavioural addictions, tolerance is usually defined in a way that superficially resembles its counterpart in substance addictions, i.e. dose escalation to achieve the same initial effect. Thus, tolerance is portrayed as an increase in various aspects of the activity (frequency, intensity, duration, time spent, money spent) to achieve the desired effect, satisfaction or excitement. Occasionally, it is described as a need for the latest or more powerful equipment (e.g. mobile phones, computers, software) to produce the desired effect or excitement [7,8]. The diagnostic criteria for internet gaming disorder [9] do not state the purpose of an increase in activity engagement, implying that any such increase denotes tolerance. Nevertheless, increased activity engagement and a need for better equipment in behavioural addictions do not necessarily reflect tolerance [10,11], which underscores the importance of assessing the contextual aspects of these phenomena. Withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions have usually been described as emotional states (irritability, restlessness, anger, moodiness, sadness, guilt, anxiety, feeling tense) that occur when activity engagement is thwarted. In internet gaming disorder, withdrawal symptoms can be easily mistaken for reactions to an externally imposed gaming deprivation or for craving for gaming [12]. There have been no reports of severe physical withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions [13], and a few studies reporting physical withdrawal symptoms in pathological gambling [14,15] had significant methodological shortcomings. Withdrawal states occurring upon abrupt drug cessation comprise both physical and emotional symptoms, with the latter hypothesized to contribute more to the motivation to continue using drugs because of the short-lasting effects of the former [2]. In pathological gambling, however, emotional withdrawal symptoms, as well as tolerance, were not found to play an important role in maintaining this behavioural addiction [16]. ‘Borrowing’ tolerance and withdrawal from substance addictions might have been driven by a need to ‘legitimize’ behavioural addictions. This was unnecessary, because these phenomena and theories suggesting that they are important for addiction have not been able to account fully for either type of addiction [5]. The alternative is to conceptualize behavioural addictions via specific factors that explain more clearly attachment to the particular activity [17] and maintenance of addictive behaviour. In pathological gambling, these factors were identified as the negative feelings associated with gambling losses, shortage of money and the need to be secretive about gambling [16]. The task is to ascertain factors that provide an adequate account for each behavioural addiction. None.",

Some cognitive deficits may be present before illness onset but after illness onset, and especially after the first episode of mania, meaningful pathophysiological changes start occurring. These changes, detected in serum levels, may mediate dysfunction, affecting neuropsychological performance. Following the neuroprogressive hypothesis, a poorer clinical course of the illness may also have a negative influence on cognition. This means that a higher number of episodes, the duration of illness, and the number of hospitalizations may be related to more cognitive impairment. In general, longitudinal studies about neurocognitive functioning have found a stable pattern of cognitive impairment over time. Despite the research efforts in this area, the neurocognitive outcome in BD is still unclear. The heterogeneity in the neurocognitive impairment and its link with staging models presents one of the challenges in the upcoming years.",

      "title": "[Nighttime eating disorders--clinical symptoms and treatment].",
      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

      "abstract": "Any systemic or neurological condition can cause sleep disruption. Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

In both a group of twin volunteers and a group of patients with panic disorder/agoraphobia, the lifetime experience of more than one diagnosis of a neurotic syndrome was common but there was no evidence of patterns of co-occurrence of diagnoses being associated with particular syndromes. Receiving a diagnosis was associated with abnormal scores on measures of neuroticism and locus of control, the extent of the abnormality increasing with the number of different diagnoses satisfied. It is argued that the concept of a general neurotic syndrome depends in part on the presence of such predisposing personality factors, and that reduction in this predisposition to neurosis should be the focus of treatment.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

The temporal experience is fundamentally disturbed in depression and recent neurophenomenological findings help in better understanding this dimension. The duration of symptoms needed to fulfil diagnostic criteria are somewhat arbitrary. Depression dramatically decreases life expectancy mainly through increased non-suicidal mortality. The time from help seeking to getting treatment (between delayed help seeking and the emergency room) is contradictory and the length of treatment (from too short to too long) suggests that taking better account of these phenomena could improve depression treatment.",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced dystonia (DID) is a rarely diagnosed adverse reaction to a sufficiently large number of drugs. Acute DID (ADID) occurs soon after starting to take a drug or raising its dose, and switching from one antipsychotic medication to another, especially to its injectable dosage form. Tardive DID (TDID) develops a few months or years after starting drug intake or 3 months after stopping therapy. The diagnosis of TDID is based on the persistence of dystonic hyperkinesis for more than 1 month, the use of a dopamine receptor blocking agent, and the absence of other causes of its development. The risk factors for DID are male sex; young age (less than 30 years of age); a history of dystonic reactions; hypocalcemia, alcohol use while taking the drug. DID is most commonly related to therapy with antipsychotics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. The short-term use of anticholinergic drugs (benzotropin, diphenhydramine) is effective in treating ADID. Anticholinergic drugs and atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine), benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants (baclofen), and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (tetrabenazine) are used to treat TDID. To prevent DID, it is very important that a physician should be aware of that this unwanted adverse reaction may occur and that a drug with the lowest risk for DID should be chosen.",

The relative risks according to age groups or number and kinds of antiepileptic drugs used are undetermined. It is not known if detected abnormalities are static or slowly progressive.

This descriptive study aimed to document cognitive deficits in a sample of the 2003 infected population reported in New Mexico. Patients with clinically defined neuroinvasive disease or who were impaired on brief mental status screening were seen for comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. We found that one year after symptom onset, more than half of the sample had objectively measurable neuropsychological impairment in at least two cognitive domains. Impairment was not related to subjective complaints of physical or emotional distress, or premorbid intellectual abilities. Persistent cognitive impairment in West Nile virus infection may be due to prolonged or permanent damage to the central nervous system.",

The prevalence of MCI among elderly people is 12-17% but the risk of progression of cognitive impairment and development of dementia during 5 years is up to 70%. Cerebral vascular diseases and initial stages of neurodegenerative processes are the cause of MCI. Clinical characteristics of MCI depend on the main etiological factor. To decrease the severity of symptoms and prevent the progression of cognitive impairment in MCI patients, pharmacotherapy and non-medication methods, including diet optimization, stimulation of mental and physical activity, are used. Dopaminergic and noradrenergic therapy is most prevalent among pharmacological methods.Умеренные когнитивные нарушения (УКН) представляют собой промежуточную стадию между нормальным старением и деменцией. Распространенность синдрома УКН среди пожилых составляет 12-17%, а риск прогрессирования когнитивных нарушений и развития деменции за 5 лет - до 70%. Причиной синдрома УКН являются сосудистые заболевания головного мозга и начальные стадии нейродегенеративных процессов. В зависимости от основного этиологического фактора клиническая картина синдрома УКН имеет свои особенности. Для уменьшения выраженности симптомов и профилактики прогрессирования когнитивных расстройств у пациентов с синдромом УКН применяют фармакотерапию и немедикаментозные методы, такие как оптимизация питания, стимуляция умственной и физической активности.

Stroke patients frequently represent mood disturbances, cognitive decline, anxiety disorders, and sometimes serious schizophorm or paranoid states. Poststroke depression is the most common and possibly amenable form to therapeutic intervention. Depressive symptoms have negative effect on the rehabilitation process, quality of life and even on long-term survival. Considering drug therapy, in the past decade tricyclic drugs have been replaced by newly developed antidepressants with milder side-effects profile. Our knowledge on the relationship among vascular and other types of dementia has been extended in the recent years. This development also has some therapeutic implications. It seems likely that other psychiatric disorders, psychoses, pathological affect and personality disorders also inhibit recovery and limit long-term quality of life, but available data on this topic is limited.",

      "title": "Preventing clinical deterioration in the course of schizophrenia: the potential for neuroprotection.",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia, which has both genetic and environmental causes, is associated with persistent symptoms and severe functional disability. The illness lies dormant during the premorbid phase and begins to express itself during adolescence or early adulthood. Clinical progression and deterioration reaches a plateau in which the patient is said to be in the chronic phase of illness and at which point restoration of prior functioning is unlikely. The severe deficits associated with schizophrenia are often the result of progression of illness due to lack of appropriate treatment. However, recent advances in neuropsychiatry have led to very early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis, even during the prodromal stage when psychosis has not yet manifested clinically. While research has demonstrated that the efficacy of antipsychotics is limited when used during the chronic phase of illness, these medications can effectively control symptoms and prevent progression of illness when used during the early stages of illness. The evidence of neural degeneration in the pathophysiology of schizophrenic illness suggests that there may be treatment opportunities through neural protection. Neuroprotection, which refers to treatment that helps maintain central nervous system functionality in response to neurobiologic stress, may be responsible for prevention of disease progression and deterioration. In this monograph, Jeffrey L. Lieberman, MD, introduces the phases of schizophrenic illness in relation to the concepts of progression and deterioration. Next, Dolores Malaspina, MD, reviews the neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative components of schizophrenia. Finally, L. Fredrik Jarskog, MD, focuses on the neuroprotective aspects of therapeutic interventions in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Neglect",
      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

The studies that are available have significant methodologic problems, including the mixing of early- and late-onset patients, inadequate outcome criteria, and the lack of control groups. Studies of conventional neuroleptics suggest that older patients have a moderate therapeutic response but are likely to develop side effects. The few studies of atypical antipsychotics now available suggest efficacy for treatment of behavioral disturbance in the elderly and a more favorable side-effect profile. The usefulness of all neuroleptics for the treatment of the core symptoms of late-life schizophrenia may depend on the duration and severity of the symptoms, with a poor response associated with greater severity and duration. It appears that patients with later-onset symptoms may respond better to all neuroleptics.",

It is a neurologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

Drugs of abuse produce a variety of CNS effects resulting in cognitive deficits which include reduced memory performance, poor performance on attention tasks and learning deficits. It has been suggested that the use of these drugs may alter normal brain functions and possibly have neurotoxic effects. Supporting this hypothesis is the association between drug abuse and decreased white matter volume. There is sufficient evidence that drug abuse causes neurotoxicity although the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. There are a number of experimental evidences indicating that neurotrophins levels may be altered by psychoactive drugs. The most common drugs studied in relation to neurotrophins were cannabis, nicotine, amphetamines, alcohol, cocaine and opioids. The synaptic plasticity is defined as experience dependent changes in the efficacy or strength of synaptic transmission. Deficits in the production and utilization of neurotrophines can lead to a variety of CNS dysfunctions as impaired brain development and psychiatric disorders e.g., schizophrenia. Till now, no researches establish if the addictive drugs could affect the structural plasticity or not. So it is important to study the relationship between plasticity and addiction-associated behaviors and study the correlation between the excitatory synaptic transmission and drugdependent behaviors.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

Faced with recommending long-term treatment, the clinician must discern the primacy of disorder, which may have been only obliquely addressed at the time of the patient's presentation and then solved by concurrent treatment. Establishing primacy relies on determining whether the psychiatric symptoms were induced by SUD or the psychiatric disorder emerged first and substance use was a means of coping with it. A third possibility exists—that the two disorders developed independently of each other, albeit becoming intermingled over time and serving to exacerbate each other. Clues to the temporal relationship of the disorders can be deduced from a meticulous history obtained from multiple sources, the effects that acute treatment has had on either condition, and the patient's willingness to remain abstinent from the addictive substance. Hasin and colleagues demonstrated the importance that a history of depression has on long-term remission and relapse outcomes in substance dependence (Slide 1).",

Treatment can vary from none at all (eg, in the child with a single febrile seizure) to the use of more than one drug and the ketogenic diet (eg, in poorly controlled atypical absence, atonic, and some myoclonic disorders). When drug therapy is required, an appropriate agent is started and the dosage increased as needed to control seizures. If seizures persist or toxicity occurs, another drug should be substituted. When the patient has been seizure-free for a year, the drug can be slowly decreased and eventually discontinued. Any recurrence is most likely to occur within the first year after anticonvulsive medication is stopped.",

      "abstract": "There are many reports of cognitive dysfunction in patients receiving chemotherapy or targeted therapies. Many antineoplastic agents may be involved in the condition also known as \"chemo brain\" or \"chemo fog\". Two male patients (aged 41 and 70) with multiple myeloma developed severe, rapidly progressing cognitive impairment (mostly involving episodic memory) and loss of independence in activities of daily living during lenalidomide-based treatment. On withdrawal of the drug, one patient recovered normal cognitive function and independence in activities of daily living, whereas mild cognitive impairment persisted in the other patient. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score was 6 out of 13 for the first patient and 5 out of 13 for the second, suggesting a probable causal relationship between the adverse event and lenalidomide administration. Lenalidomide may induce particular cognitive disorders (notably episodic memory impairments) in some patients. The drug's putative neurotoxicity is probably promoted by specific risk factors (such as previous chemotherapy, prior mild cognitive impairment, age and the presence of cerebrovascular lesions).",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

In the assessment of cognitive functioning in the elderly, there are at least four ways in which a model or theoretical approach is useful for differentiating among the disorders affecting the elderly. Neuropsychology plays an especially important role in the diagnosis of disorders in the elderly whenever cognitive functioning has been compromised. The medical and psychiatric history included marked anxiety presenting early and consistently in the disorder, outstanding memory disorder with the eventual development of a dementia, seizures, abnormal EEG, and a secondary carcinoma in the lung. The stage model has the potential for confirming or disconfirming a diagnosis because deviations from the predicted pattern of regression would signify that a different disorder is present.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment and dementia are an relevant problem of modern neurology and psychiatry, which is explained by their wide prevalence, as well as the predicted increase in the number of patients in the future. However, dementia in most cases does not occur acutely, its development is preceded by a long period when cognitive impairments do not disrupt the patient’s everyday and professional life yet. Such cognitive impairments are called “pre-dementia” and are divided into subjective, subtle, and mild. With subjective cognitive impairment, patients present complaints; however, neuropsychological testing does not reveal decreased cognitive functions. Subtle cognitive impairment is accompanied by a decrease in cognitive functions when using highly sensitive scales. This article provides an overview of current data on the definition, classification, diagnosis, and treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the point of view of the evidence-based medicine for timely diagnostics of the state and its effective correction. In patients with MCI, in addition to complaints of cognitive deficit, it is detected during screening neuropsychological testing; but unlike dementia, it does not impair the patient’s functionality. MCI is a leading risk factor for future dementia. However, according to research, cognitive deficits can not only progress, but also stabilize and even regress. In this regard, it is important to identify patients with MCI on time, establish nosological affiliation for correcting risk factors and prescribing treatment. The most common causes of MCI can be neurodegenerative disorders (primarily Alzheimer’s disease) and cerebrovascular diseases. The authors present the diagnostic value of popular scales such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale and the 3-CT test in the diagnosis of MCI. The possibilities of using biomarkers, such as the determination of beta-amyloid and tau-protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the detection of signs of neuronal damage during neuroimaging of the brain, are discussed. It is stated that the most proven methods of influencing cognitive deficits in MCI are non-drug measures.",

This experience and its impact on disease management are magnified in chronic illnesses.

No medications have been shown to have a consistent therapeutic benefit. Delirium is a form of brain dysfunction characterized by the acute onset of fluctuating mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. These features are also seen in states of acute sleep deprivation. It is believed that the state of delirium contributes to disrupted sleep just as sleep deprivation is considered a modifiable risk factor for delirium. Improving sleep conditions and other nonpharmacologic interventions to promote sleep may be an underused approach to preventing and treating delirium in critical illness.",

      "abstract": "Encephalopathy is evidenced as an altered mental state with various neurological symptoms, such as memory and cognitive problems. The type of a substance-evoked encephalopathy will depend on the drug, substance, or combination being abused. The categories into which we could place the various abused substances could be tentatively divided into stimulants, amphetamines, hallucinogens, narcotics, inhalants, anesthetics, anabolic steroids, and antipsychotics/antidepressants. Other factors that may underlie encephalopathy, such as infectious agents, environmental, and other factors have also to be taken into account. Drugs of abuse can be highly toxic to the CNS following acute, but more so in chronic exposure, and can produce significant damage to other organs, such as the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. The damage to these organs may be at least partially reversible when drug abuse is stopped but CNS damage from repeated or prolonged abuse is often irreversible. The major pathways for the organ and CNS toxicity could be related to ischemic events as well as increased cell damage due to metabolic or mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in increased excitotoxicity, reduced energy production, and lowered antioxidant potential. These susceptibilities could be strengthened by the use of antioxidants to combat free radicals (e.g., vitamin E, lipoic acid); trying to improve energy generation by using mitochondriotropic/metabolic compounds (e.g., thiamine, coenzyme Q10, carnitine, riboflavin); by reducing excitotoxicity (e.g., glutamate antagonists) and other possible strategies, such as robust gene response, need to be investigated further. The drug-abuse-evoked encephalopathy still needs to be studied further to enable better preventative and protective strategies.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol shows a high affinity by nervous system, and that explains the behaviour-altering effects of drinking. Te nervous system affinity of alcohol is due to biochemical and metabolic characteristics of this substance: 1) Alcohol is rapidly and homogeneously distributed by body tissues and fluids, penetrating through body barriers, including the hematoencephalic one. 2) Because of its great liposolubility, it interacts with lipoid component in neuronal membrane causing long-term changes in neuronal conductance, and long-term structural changes. Behaviour disturbances in alcohol-abusing persons are related with: 1) Alcohol acute effects on neuronal membrane and synapses consisting in transitional disturbances on membrane potential and neurotransmission function. 2) Alcohol long-term effect causing by brain adjustment in synaptic transmission. 3) The relative irreversible disturbances induced by structural synaptic damage. 4) Other conditions related with alcohol abuse but not directly causing by it, such as nutritional deficiencies, and pathologic conditions seen in chronic alcoholism. In clinical practice we usually find disorders due to acute effects of ethanol on brain like different disorders related with alcohol intoxication; disorders due to tolerance development, such as withdrawal syndrome; and those chronic ad multicausal conditions with different degree of reversibility which are consequences of structural brain damage, like Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy, alcoholic neuropthaty, and alcohol induced dementia.",

Clinical manifestations include delayed weaning from the respirator and prolongation of the rehabilitation phase. The available data indicate that critical illness polyneuropathy is the most frequent cause of such secondary neuromuscular problems. For differential diagnosis prolonged neuromuscular blockade and several myopathies have to be taken into consideration. The pathogenesis of critical illness polyneuropathy is unknown. It has been suggested that the factors mediating the systemic inflammatory response are also responsible for axonal damage in critical illness polyneuropathy. We recently described a neurotoxic activity present in the sera of affected patients, which can be reversed completely by NMDA antagonists. The critical illness per se is unrelated to the development of neuropathy. By contrast, occurrence of myopathies may be triggered by exogenous factors such as high-dose glucosteroids and non-depolarizing muscle blocking agents. Detailed electrodiagnostic studies are desirable in patients with long-lasting ICU stays, whenever possible as weekly monitoring. In doubtful cases, muscle biopsy might be necessary for proper diagnosis and management.",

      "abstract": "Tradicionalmente se han venido distinguiendo dos grandes tipologias de criminalidad relacionadas con las drogas, la delincuencia funcional y la delincuencia inducida. En ambos casos de criminalidad la causa de la delincuencia es el consumo de drogas. El Codigo penal de 1995 presta especial atencion al problema del consumo y la dependencia de las drogas aportando una regulacion especifica sobre la incidencia que sobre la capacidad de culpabilidad tiene el consumo y la dependencia de las drogas. La eximente de intoxicacion requiere tres elementos: Un presupuesto biologico o psiquiatrico, un estado de intoxicacion en el momento de cometer el delito un componente psicologico, imposibilidad de comprender el caracter ilicito de su conducta o de actuar conforme a ese conocimiento y un requisito\nnegativo, que la intoxicacion no haya sido provocada con el proposito de cometer el delito o que el sujeto haya previsto o debido prever que en estado de intoxicacion podria cometer un delito. El sindrome de abstinencia es una alteracion psiquica que se caracteriza por un sindrome especifico, que viene determinado por la clase de sustancia, debido al cese o reduccion del consumo prolongado de esa sustancia. El estado carencial crea una presion motivacional que explica la falta de libertad en el proceso de determinacion de la voluntad para actuar conforme a la norma. La adiccion a sustancias psicoactivas se define como un estado psiquico y fisico determinado por el consumo continuado de droga durante un periodo de tiempo, que se caracteriza por la perdida del control en el uso de la susta\nncia. La introduccion de la atenuante de grave adiccion supone reconocer que el consumo de drogas reiterado puede ocasionar una adiccion a las sustancias, que influye en la capacidad volitiva del sujeto limitando de forma relevante su\ncapacidad de actuar conforme a la norma dado la compulsion al consumo de esa sustancia. Desde esta concepcion de la grave adiccion lo coherente hubiera sido reconocer a la grave adiccion como un supuesto de semi-imputabilidad y no como una mera atenuante de la culpabilidad. Lo que permitiria, sin necesidad de acudir a la analogia in bonam partem, aplicar al adicto la medida de seguridad de tratamiento de deshabituacion.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "abstract": "The Neurobiology of Opioid Dependence: Implications for Treatment W W hile the individual patient, rather than his or her disease, is the appro- priate focus of treatment for opioid abuse, an understanding of the neurobiology of dependence and addiction can be invaluable to the clinician.It can provide insight about patient behaviors and problems, help define realistic expectations, and clarify the rationales for treatment methods and goals.As well, patients who are informed about the brain origins of addiction can benefit from understanding that their illness has a biological basis and does not mean they are \"bad\" people.Brain abnormalities resulting from chronic use of heroin, oxycodone, and other morphine-derived drugs are underlying causes of opioid dependence (the need to keep taking drugs to avoid a withdrawal syndrome) and addiction (intense drug craving and compulsive use).The abnormalities that produce dependence, well understood by science, appear to resolve after detoxification, within days or weeks after opioid use stops.The abnormalities that produce addiction, however, are more wide-ranging, complex, and long-lasting.They may involve an interaction of environmental effects-for example, stress, the social context of initial opiate use, and psychological conditioning-and a genetic predisposition in the form of brain pathways that were abnormal even before the first dose of opioid was taken.Such abnormalities can produce craving that leads to relapse months or years after the individual is no longer opioid dependent.In this article we describe how opioids affect brain processes to produce drug liking, tolerance, dependence, and addiction.While these processes, like everything else that happens in the brain, are highly complex, we try to explain them in terms that can be easily understood and explained to patients.We also discuss Opioid tolerance, dependence, and addiction are all manifestations of brain changes resulting from chronic opioid abuse.The opioid abuser's struggle for recovery is in great part a struggle to overcome the effects of these changes.Medications such as methadone, LAAM, buprenorphine, and naltrexone act on the same brain structures and processes as addictive opioids, but with protective or normalizing effects.Despite the effectiveness of medications, they must be used in conjunction with appropriate psychosocial treatments.",

This chapter presents a clinical approach to evaluating the patient with dementia. The first part draws on the traditional methods of clinical neurology using history and examination to define the nature of the patient's affliction. It then focuses on disorders with subacute onset over days to weeks, and a range of uncommon conditions that produce cognitive and neuropsychiatric disturbances often in conjunction with systemic medical illness. It is no easy task to navigate the complex landscape of cognitive decline when the scenario deviates from the expected pattern of deficits encountered in neurodegenerative disorders. The potential treatable causes of confusion, cognitive decline, and dementia cannot be treated unless diagnosed.",

      "title": "Predementia neurocognitive impairment in the elderly",
      "abstract": "Cognitive decline is one of the main manifestations of brain damage especially in the elderly. In some cases, cognitive dysfunction stayed within normal aging and do not lead to social dis-adaptation, while in other cases severe cognitive impairment develops when daily activity and domestic independence is affected. However, these disturbances are preceded by prolonged intermediate stage, when cognitive deficit do not reach the degree of dementia, but already do not match normal aging. Initial terms (for example benign senescent forgetfulness) were interpreted as aging phenomena. Later this state named as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered as prodromal phase of demented disease. Up to date studies allow us consider MCI as an integral part of the complex structure of overlapping syndromes ('pre-cognitive impairment'), the allocation of which have not only theoretical, but also pragmatic meaning, allow us, on the one hand, to plan clinical trials series with various therapeutic targets, and, on the other hand, to form rational approach to the modern management of patients with MCI and pre-MCI in clinical practice.Нарушения нейрокогнитивных функций – одно из основных проявлений поражения головного мозга, особенно часто развивающееся в пожилом возрасте. У значительной части пожилых лиц закономерные ('возрастные') изменения когнитивных функций не выходят за рамки возрастной нормы и не приводят к социальной дезадаптации, тогда как в других случаях нарастает когнитивный дефицит, в результате которого человек утрачивает трудоспособность, а затем и бытовую независимость, что принято обозначать как деменция. Однако слабоумие не развивается мгновенно - ему предшествует более или менее длительный переходный период, в течение которого когнитивные нарушения уже выходят из границ возрастной нормы, но еще не достигают степени, которую обычно ассоциируют с понятием деменции. Тем не менее именно появление признаков деменции в течение длительного времени служило критерием основных заболеваний, преимущественно проявляющихся когнитивными нарушениями. Необходимость их более ранней диагностики привела к концепции 'умеренного когнитивного расстройства' (УКР). Проведенные к настоящему времени исследования позволяют рассматривать УКР как составную часть сложной структуры перекрывающихся синдромов ('преддементных когнитивных нарушений'), выделение которых может иметь не только теоретическое, но и сугубо прагматическое значение, позволяя, с одной стороны, спланировать серию клинических испытаний с различными терапевтическими мишенями, а, с другой - выстроить рациональные подходы к ведению больных в клинической практике.",

      "abstract": "Summary While all patients with epilepsy experience seizures, not all individuals with seizures have epilepsy. Seizures may be acute symptomatic or unprovoked. Acute symptomatic seizures are seizures occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Unprovoked seizures are seizures occurring in the absence of precipitating factors and may be caused by a static injury (remote symptomatic seizures) or a progressing injury (progressive symptomatic seizures). Unprovoked seizures may be single or recurrent (epilepsy). The incidence of acute symptomatic seizures is 29–39 per 100,000 per year. These predominate in men, in the youngest age class, and in the elderly. Traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, drug withdrawal, infarction, and metabolic insults are the commonest causes. The incidence of single unprovoked seizures is 23–61 per 100,000 person‐years. As with epilepsy, single unprovoked seizures predominate in men and in patients less than 12 months and older than 65 years. Studies on the mortality of acute symptomatic seizures are lacking. A standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 2.3 has been reported in patients experiencing a single unprovoked seizure. The SMR in patients with a newly diagnosed unprovoked seizure ranges from 2.5 to 4.1 according to the study population and design. The SMR is highest in the youngest patients and in those with symptomatic seizures.",

There are no good prognostic indicators other than a history of repeated relapses and positive responses to neuroleptics. 2. When and for how long--should always be considered for the patient who has had more than two acute episodes. The first year post-acute episode back in the community is extremely critical. Consider maintaining patient on tapering dosage of medication for at least four to five years. 3. What benefits--symptoms of acute psychosis respond, those of chronic defect state do not. Medication also can act as buffer against stress. 4. Dosages--standard range is the equivalent of 300-800 mg. of Thorazine for most patients. Dose range for depot administration of Prolixin decanoate is 25-62.5 mg. 2-4 week intervals. Differences within this range may not be important. Data about very low doses (one-tenth standard dose) and megadoses (4-5 times standard dose) are inconsistent. 5. Risks--extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and akinetic depression are the most prevalent risks. Extrapyramidal symptoms can often be controlled effectively with dosage reduction. However, anticholinergic drugs are the treatment of choice during acute phases, and for the first 3-5 months post-acute phase. Tardive dyskinesia rarely occurs after a few weeks or months, but occurs most commonly beginning after two years of drug treatment. The usual form is persistent, but transient forms also occur. The earliest signs are reversible in some patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms.

Trauma results from intoxication and from violence related to a drug's illegality. Infection, including AIDS, is most often a consequence of parenteral use. Seizures can be secondary to either toxicity or withdrawal. Stroke can be ischemic or hemorrhagic. Persistent cognitive dysfunction affects alcoholics and probably users of other drugs as well. Teratogenicity is better documented for ethanol and tobacco than for illicit drugs. Other complications of recreational drug use include peripheral neuropathy, myelopathy, parkinsonism, leukoencephalopathy, optic atrophy, and cerebellar ataxia.",

      "title": "The Nature of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

Deprescribing is recommended when there is loss of efficacy, major side effects, or use longer than four weeks. The withdrawal syndrome is due to physiologic dependence based on various receptor adaptations. Psychological, neurophysiologic, and somatic complaints can be misdiagnosed as psychiatric, psychosomatic, or substance use disorder. These symptoms may be severe and prolonged. The discontinuation process should include careful planning, support, and the use of cognitive behavioral therapy. Tapering, perhaps after substituting with a long-acting BzRA, should be patient-led and proceed slowly, anticipating completion over 12 to 18 months or even longer. In a proportion of patients, symptoms may continue months or years after complete BzRA cessation, requiring ongoing medical care.",

Facilitating theDiagnostic Assessment 1. Deficits in intellectual functioning: Problems with reasoning (to supplement standardized testing, the practitioner can use scenarios of current everyday situations the individual will confront, consistent with developmental age, and document problematic responses) Problem-solving difficulties (to supplement standardized testing, ask basic questions that are age and/or developmentally appropriate, and document problematic responses)",

      "abstract": "Brain function relies on efficient coordinated neuronal network activity.Neuronal cross talk and cerebral connectivity is fragile and occurs within tight metabolic and biochemical ranges.Breakdown in brain network dynamics by stressors that hamper cerebral metabolism or neuron neurophysiology led to \"Acute Brain Failure\" syndromes (ABF) [1].ABF, under stressful event, is more likely to happen in individuals with baseline low brain resilience due to previous insults such as pre-existing neurodegenerative disorders, stroke or systemic comorbid conditions, similarly to acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure [2].According to the context, ABF may manifest clinically as Altered Mental State (AMS), delirium or worsening of, already impaired, neurological function.Although such model sets a good framework for the understanding of ABF, it does not provide pathophysiological mechanisms and therefore often confines the therapeutic interventions to symptomatic treatment.Precipitating factors of ABF such as electrolytic imbalances, hypo-glycemia, drug withdrawal, infection… are also known precipitating factors of epileptic activity and could represent one of the missing links between acute brain stressful events and ABF [3].The aim of our studies was to assess the role of Interictal Epileptic Discharges (IED), Periodic Discharges (PDs) and Non-Convulsive Seizures (NCSz) in relationship to ABF in several different acute brain insults.Indeed, IED are generally thought to be asymptomatic but dedicated studies showed alterations of cognitive functions related to IED in both children [4][5][6] and adults [7,8] as well as brain network functional connectivity impairments [9][10][11][12].Similarly, manifestations of PDs and NCSz range from subtle cognitive disturbances, with abnormal behaviour, mood changes, and higher function impairment to clouding of consciousness and unresponsiveness [13][14][15].Epileptic activities, even IED [16][17][18], also increase brain metabolic rate, a phenomenon that can lead to a \"metabolic crisis\" and ABF in situations where the brain metabolism is already fragilized by acute stressors [19][20].Our hypothesis was, thus, that IED, PDs and/or NCSz triggered by acute medical conditions could participate in ABF onset and perpetuation.We first focused on (i) broad-spectrum antibiotherapy in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), then on (ii) delirium on older individuals and finally on (iii) Early Neurological Degradation (END) after ischemic stroke.",

      "abstract": "As critical illness survivorship increases, patients and health care providers are faced with management of long-term sequelae including cognitive and functional impairment. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated impairments persisting at least 1–5 years after hospitalization for critical illness. Cognitive domains impacted include memory, attention, and processing speed. Functional impairments include physical weakness, reduced endurance, and dependence on others for basic tasks of daily living such as bathing or feeding. In characterizing the trajectory of long-term recovery, multiple risk factors have been identified for subsequent impairment, including increased severity of illness and severe sepsis, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and delirium. Preadmission status including frailty, high level of preexisting comorbidities, and baseline cognitive dysfunction are also associated with impairment after critical illness. Development of cognitive and functional impairment is likely multifactorial, and multiple mechanistic theories have been proposed. Neuroinflammation, disruption of the blood–brain barrier, and structural alterations in the brain have all been observed in patients with long-term cognitive dysfunction. Systemic inflammation has also been associated with alterations in muscle integrity and function, which is associated with intensive care unit–acquired weakness and prolonged functional impairment. Efforts to ease the burden of long-term impairments include prevention strategies and rehabilitation interventions after discharge. Delirium is a well-established risk factor for long-term cognitive dysfunction, and using delirium-prevention strategies may be important for cognitive protection. Current evidence favors minimizing overall sedation exposure, careful selection of sedation agents including avoidance of benzodiazepines, and targeted sedation goals to avoid oversedation. Daily awakening and spontaneous breathing trials and early mobilization have shown benefit in both cognitive and functional outcomes. Multifactorial prevention bundles are useful tools in improving care provided to patients in the intensive care unit. Data regarding cognitive rehabilitation are limited, while studies on functional rehabilitation have conflicting results. Continued investigation and implementation of prevention strategies and rehabilitation interventions will hopefully improve the quality of life for the ever-increasing population of critical illness survivors.",

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

In neurophysiological terms, pain is experienced when selected areas in the limbic system, particularly neurones in the cingulate gyrus and related areas of the somatosensory cortex are excited at the same time . Physiologically, this condition arises when nociceptors in peripheral tissues are stimulated, as is the case following trauma in acute pain or in inflammatory pain (nociceptive pain). However, it is not uncommon that excitation of limbic and related somatosensory cortical neurones originate from abnormal, usually damaged, peripheral or central nervous tissue (neuropathic pain) or as the consequence of psychological mechanisms (psychogenic pain). For the individual it does not matter how the typical state of limbic and somatosensory cortex excitation comes about, because the end result is just as unpleasant.",

      "title": "[Neurobiology of addictive behavior].",
      "abstract": "Addictive behavior developes after repeated substance use and it typically include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to the drug use than to other activities. Relapse, the resumption of drug taking after periods of abstinence, remains the major problem for the treatment of addiction. The process of drug addiction shares striking commonalities with neural plasticity associated with natural reward learning and memory and is caused primarily by drug-induced sensitization in the brain mesocorticolimbic systems that attribute incentive salience to reward-associated stimuli. The switch from controlled to compulsive drug seeking represents a transition at the neural level from prefrontal cortical to striatal control. Current neurophysiologic evidence suggests that the development of addiction is to some extent due to neurochemical stimulation of the midbrain dopaminergic system that is traditionally considered as a 'common neural currency' for rewards of most kinds. Addictions are a result of the interplay of multiple genetic and environmental factors. They are characterized by phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity as well as polygenicity. Environmental factors are crucial in addiction vulnerability and resistese too.",

      "abstract": "Seizures are common in the intensive care unit, both in patients with brain injury and those with other forms of critical illness. Many of these are nonconvulsive and have been increasingly recognized with the advent of continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. When seizures are prolonged or recur without a return to baseline, this is termed status epilepticus (SE)—a true medical emergency. Progression to refractory SE may occur quickly after onset, with a high potential for subsequent permanent neuronal damage. Successful management of SE therefore rests with early recognition and treatment, with a low threshold to begin anesthetic agents if seizures remain refractory to initial therapy. Meanwhile, a concurrent focus should be placed on airway, breathing, and circulation, as well as identifying the etiology of the seizures. Etiology is likely the best determinant of outcomes after SE (with outcomes worst for anoxic brain injury, followed by other newly acquired brain injury), while prolonged and refractory SE also portend a poorer prognosis.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

Leur point commun est l'apparition d'une diminution de la force musculaire, notamment des muscles respiratoires conditionnant le pronostic vital. La survenue d'une insuffisance respiratoire est en general progressive et insidieuse. Son diagnostic repose sur des examens cliniques et para-cliniques. Pour la plupart de ces pathologies, il n’existe aucun traitement curatif. Seule la ventilation mecanique associee a une prise en charge cardiaque adaptee permet, pour certaines pathologies, une survie prolongee avec une qualite de vie satisfaisante. Son indication au long cours peut se poser de differentes manieres : soit au decours d'une decompensation respiratoire aigue revelatrice de la maladie ou survenant en l'absence de suivi, soit de facon programmee (le cas le plus frequent) dans le cadre d’un suivi pluridisciplinaire. Les criteres d'indication retenus sont l’existence d’au moins un signe clinique evoquant une atteinte respiratoire, associee a une PaCO2 > 45 mmgH ou a une CV < 50% ou a une desaturation nocturne. Toutefois ces indications sont a nuancer en fonction de la pathologie et de la clinique. D’autre part, il existe egalement tres peu d'etudes ayant pu demontrer l'efficacite de la ventilation sur la survie, ceci est du a la rarete de ces pathologies et de la duree necessaire des etudes. En outre, l'utilisation de la tracheotomie comme technique de ventilation reste discutee. Les objectifs de ce travail sont : dans un premier temps, de decrire l'evolution de la prise en charge respiratoire chez les patients atteints d'une maladie neuromusculaire et d'identifier les facteurs predictifs de mise sous ventilation invasive. Ensuite d'analyser les facteurs influencant l’observance de la ventilation non invasive et de mesurer l’impact de celle-ci sur la survie des patients atteints d'une dystrophie myotonique de type 1. Enfin, d'analyser l'impact de la ventilation mecanique invasive lorsque la ventilation non invasive est inefficace sur la survie des patients atteints d'une myopathie de Duchenne de Boulogne.",

      "abstract": "References 316Many of the distinctions among the illnesses that cause the syndrome of dementia become blurred or disappear in advanced or late stage dementia for several reasons. First, neuropathological abnormalities become so widespread that almost all brain systems that subserve cognition and function become impaired. A second and related issue is that the widespread involvement of subcortical or 'downstream' structures and systems results in widespread and near total dysfunction of 'upstream' cognitive and motor systems that are not directly involved by neuropathology. Thus, this chapter will approach late stage or advanced dementia as a single or common end point of all the dementias even though some distinctions, for example the frequency of myoclonus and seizures, do persist. Thus, while knowledge of the unique aspects of specific diseases plays a prominent role in the care of people with dementia in the earlier stages of the dementia, this is usually not the case in late-stage dementia (Robinson et al., 2006).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Confusion is a non-specific, non-diagnostic term to describe a patient with disorientation, impaired memory, or abnormal thought process. Agitation describes an increased level of psychomotor activity, and anxious or aggressive behaviour. Many agitated patients may also be delirious, yet they only represent a minority of all delirious patients. ICU delirium is an acute cognitive disorder of both consciousness and content of thought. The hallmark of ICU delirium is a fluctuating mental status, inattention, and an altered level of consciousness. Delirium is the end product of a sequence of insults and injury that lead to a common measurable manifestation of end-organ brain injury. It does not have a single aetiology, but often has multiple different and potentially interacting aetiologies. Both non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors play important roles in the development of delirium. Importantly, the new onset of delirium should prompt the physician to investigate the underlying cause. Cognitive impairment and age are among the most important non-modifiable risk factors, whereas administration of benzodiazepines is the greatest. The alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine shows promise as a sedative reducing the risk for delirium when compared with benzodiazepines.",

      "abstract": "A attending the presentation, the participants will be able to discuss the incidence and clinical features of postoperative delirium (PD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), understand mechanisms and etiology of PD, recognize ongoing controversies surrounding the time course, the severity and even the clinical relevance of POCD and identify subgroups of patients who are at higher risk for PD and POCD and assess the preventive strategies to reduce incidence of these complications. The brain is vulnerable during the perioperative period. Neurobehavioral disturbances are common complications of surgery, manifesting in three distinct forma: Emergence delirium, postoperative delirium and POCD. The relationship between these conditions has yet to be fully elucidated. Although not limited to geriatric patients, the incidence and impact of both are more profound in geriatric population. Delirium has been shown to be associated with longer and more costly hospital course and higher likelihood of death within 6 months or postoperative institutionalization. POCD is a condition characterized by deterioration of cognitive performance after surgery presenting as impaired memory and or concentration. Perioperative physiological derangements (e.g., hypotension), anesthetics, duration of surgery, respiratory complications have been suggested as possible causes but only age and limited education has proven to be consistent risk factors in most studies. Current research suggests that patients with preoperative cognitive impairment are at higher risk for POCD because of their already compromised status and their potential vulnerability to worsen into dementia due to a less cognitive reserve. In this presentation, we review the definitions, etiology, prevention and treatment of both disorders in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery.",

An important clinical consideration for IEED is that of distinguishing mood from affect. IEED describes a syndrome of relatively stereotypical episodes of uncontrollable crying and/or laughing, resulting from lesions of multiple types, in multiple brain regions, without an apparent stimulus to trigger such responses. This syndrome is common among a number of neurological diseases like patients with a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as dementias such as Alzheimer;s disease (AD), and motor disorders such as Parkinson;s disease (PD). The neuropathological cause and neurochemistry of the disorder remains unclear. There is general agreement that IEED is the result of an injury to the neurological pathways that control the expression of emotions. Adequate treatment can reduce the frequency and improve the quality of life of patients and caregivers.",

We suggest that while concerns about litigation may partially account for the continued overreaction and minimization, a more fundamental explanation is psychiatry's continuing inability to integrate itself fully as a medical discipline. We suggest that four basic concepts about schizophrenia and its long-term treatment need to be accepted before TD can be responded to objectively: schizophrenia is a serious brain disease; neuroleptics are helpful when properly used; there are limits to the value of neuroleptic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia; and neuroleptic drugs can cause serious side effects.",

      "title": "Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (FTNCD) represents a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that compromise function of frontal brain networks, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits (see Box 65- ). More often referred to as frontotemporal dementia in the medical literature, FTNCD is a common cause of dementia among patients ages 45–65 years and comprises two sometimes overlapping clinical syndromes: behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD) (Table 3- ). The latter syndrome includes two subtypes: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. Either (1) or (2): Behavioral variant: Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: Behavioral disinhibition. Apathy or inertia. Loss of sympathy or empathy. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior. Hyperorality and dietary changes. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities. Language variant: Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production, word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise, possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed: Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroimaging. Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.83 (G31.84). ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) FTNCD involves a variety of largely nonoverlapping neuropathological patterns that are distinct from those observed among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathological subtypes include diseases that are characterized by aggregation of one of three proteins in affected frontal or temporal areas of the cerebral cortex: tau, transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), and fused-in-sarcoma (FUS). Other less common pathologies have been described. Clinical symptomatology may provide clues about the underlying FTLD subtype, but there are no strict associations between Bv-FTNCD or Lv-FTNCD and a particular histopathology. Clinical features of behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD), including progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD) Subtype Symptoms Cognitive profile Neuroimaging Motor findings Neuropathology Bv-FTNCD Behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, repetitive or stereotyped motor behaviors, and hyperorality Deficits in attention, working memory, set shifting, mental flexibility, response inhibition, and abstract reasoning, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Right hemispheric frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy, particularly involving the orbitofrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices Motor neuron disease in 10%–15%; Parkinsonian findings or supranuclear gaze disturbance in others FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS, and others Lv-FTNCD (PNFA) Slow, effortful, and telegraphic speech; dysarthria; agrammatisms; and occasional asymmetric right foot and hand motor impairment Agrammatical speech, decreased phonemic fluency, and apraxia of speech, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Left frontoinsular and perisylvian atrophy Asymmetric Parkinsonian signs, apraxia, focal dystonia, myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon, supranuclear gaze disturbance, axial rigidity, and postural instability FTLD-tau in most cases Lv-FTNCD (SD) Decreased object naming and single word comprehension Impaired naming, surface dyslexia, and prosopagnosia, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Asymmetric anterior and lateral temporal atrophy, usually left more than right Less common than in other FTNCD subtypes FTLD-TDP in most cases Note. FTLD = frontotemporal lobar degeneration; FUS = fused-in-sarcoma; TDP = transactive response DNA-binding protein. There are two general approaches to treatment of FTNCD: disease modification and symptomatic management. Disease-modifying therapies target pathogenic molecules and thereby alter, slow, or arrest the disease process. Unfortunately, no disease-modifying therapies are available for persons with FTNCD at this time. Symptomatic management attempts to control disease manifestations alone, and it is the only approach to FTNCD currently available.",

Convergence problems include the more commonly seen primary convergence accommodative synkenesis insufficiency and excess, but as well, result from destabilizing vergence disorders of convergence retraction nystagmus and convergence spasm. Convergence effort alone rarely can induce other forms of nystagmus at near. Saccadic dysfunction occurs in a large variety of muscular, neuromuscular and neurologic disorders. Accommodative insufficiency can result from head trauma, mononeuropathy affecting the third cranial nerve and cilliary ganglion, destructive intraocular disease as well as from systemic diseases such as botulism and diphtheria. Drugs can affect any of the near vision factors in dose related fashion. A complete history is paramount in reaching the correct diagnosis.",

Insomnia can be transient, short-term, or chronic in its presentation. Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related personal discomfort. Chronic insomnia can be caused by neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders starting or persisting during sleep that hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity. Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation. Agrypnia excitata (AE) is the term which aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome, whose pathogenetic mechanism consists in an intralimbic disconnection releasing the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation from corticolimbic control.",

      "title": "Microdosing psychedelics in the treatment of ADHD and comorbid disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Microdosing psychedelics has garnered considerable attention within both nonprofessional circles and the scientific community in recent years. This method involves taking small, non-hallucinogenic doses of substances like LSD or psilocybin over weeks or months, purportedly to enhance specific behaviors, emotions, or address psychiatric conditions. Exploring these assertions is crucial given the potential therapeutic value of microdosing, especially in conditions that respond positively to full psychedelic doses, such as depression. The full psychedelic experience might not always be suitable due to various factors like age, capacity to consent or comprehend the experience (e.g., dementia), or individual personality traits that might hinder surrendering to the experience. Microdosing could potentially serve as a maintenance therapy post-full dose administration, aiding specific psychological or biological processes during therapy or therapeutic exercises. Recent studies in healthy individuals highlight that small psychedelic doses have nuanced effects on pain perception, mood, neuroplasticity, sleep duration, brain connectivity, and default mode network synchronicity. However, some parameters show null effects after both single and repeated administration. Our survey research uncovered that individuals with ADHD reported symptom relief through microdosing, deeming it more effective than their conventional treatments. Subsequently, we conducted a naturalistic study following individuals with ADHD across a 4-week microdosing period. Our findings indicated a reduction in symptoms over time, an increase in trait mindfulness, and a decrease in neuroticism compared to baseline. While these results are intriguing, they necessitate validation in a clinical trial. We have recently concluded such a trial and are currently analyzing the data to further explore these effects.

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus is associated with high mortality and is a predictor of poor neurological outcome; yet the contribution of prolonged seizures to mortality and the causal sequence for neurological damage remain unclear. Many cases of status epilepticus are precipitated by illnesses that themselves are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. In studies of children, status epilepticus appears to be no better a predictor of an adverse outcome than is any seizure disorder starting at a similar age. Status epilepticus is a condition in which fast and definitive medical intervention is warranted. Random assignment to treatment groups is difficult. Evaluation of the effect of duration of seizures is also difficult, because those patients responding promptly to treatment may be quite a different population than those not responding. The study of cases of \"nonconvulsive\" status may provide information regarding the effect of these continuing ictal brain discharges, which can be evaluated without the confounding effects of concomitant metabolic (e.g., anoxic, pH, electrolyte) disturbances that accompany most cases of generalized status epilepticus. It is possible that appropriately designed prospective studies of status epilepticus and/or case-control studies will assist in evaluating the contribution of a prolonged seizure per se over and above that associated with preexisting or concurrent illness.",

      "abstract": "Intellectual dysfunction, usually involving short-term memory, abstract reasoning, visuomotor coordination, intellectual flexibility, and spatial reasoning, is a well-documented finding among alcohol imbibers of various drinking styles. Despite the diversity of groups examined and the attempted control of variables other than alcohol consumption, little concensus has been reached with regard to the chronology of dysfunction (as related to lifetime drinking style, duration of alcoholism, quantity consumed per session, or type of potable). In many instances, diet, age, and even sex have outweighed the relative influence of alcohol in the degree of intellectual dysfunction. Morphologically, brain changes tend to be in the anterior/basal areas and may involve the third ventricle, diencephalic areas, and other focal variations. Cerebellar changes also are not uncommon yet may reflect a subgroup of alcoholics rather than a generalised trend. Generally, many intellectual deficits partially rebound rapidly within the first two or three weeks after cessation of drinking, with perhaps modest further improvement if sobriety is sustained for several months. Because of the extreme heterogeneity of the alcoholic population and the potent effect of ancillary variables upon measures of intellectual functioning, control and matching of demographic factors is a paramount consideration. Demographic variables of primary concern include age, sex, socio-economic status, education, duration of alcoholism, quantity of alcohol consumed per session, diet, psychotropic medications, secondary psychiatric diagnoses, secondary medical diagnoses, exact duration of abstinence, and prior exposure to psychometric instruments.",

      "abstract": "Complaints of memory difficulties are common among patients with epilepsy, particularly with temporal lobe epilepsy where memory-related brain structures are directly involved by seizure activity. However, the reason for these complaints is often unclear and patients frequently perform normally on standard neuropsychological tests of memory. In this article, we review the literature on three recently described and interrelated forms of memory impairment associated with epilepsy: (i) transient epileptic amnesia, in which the sole or main manifestation of seizures is recurrent episodes of amnesia; (ii) accelerated long-term forgetting, in which newly acquired memories fade over days to weeks and (iii) remote memory impairment, in which there is loss of memories for personal or public facts or events from the distant past. Accelerated long-term forgetting and remote memory impairment are common amongst patients with transient epileptic amnesia, but have been reported in other forms of epilepsy. Their presence goes undetected by standard memory tests and yet they can have a profound impact on patients' lives. They pose challenges to current theoretical models of memory. We discuss the evidence for each of these phenomena, as well as their possible pathophysiological bases, methodological difficulties in their investigation and their theoretical implications.",

A typical executive task can be defined as the capacity to maintain one’s attention on the current task, that is, responding only to the correct but not to distractive stimuli. Impairments of executive functions, or executive dysfunctions, have a growing impact on everyday life and academic achievement and are usually an early feature, and one of the core features, in brain injury and memory and behavioral disorders. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that memory therapeutics cannot achieve their clinical benefits in cognition if executive dysfunction is not effectively and simultaneously treated. Improvement of executive functions might be achieved through targeting some signaling pathways in the brain, including the brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathways. These agents may be useful either as stand-alone interventions for patients with executive dysfunction and/or psychiatric and memory disorders or as essential adjuncts to drugs that target the underlying pathology in various brain injury and memory and behavioral disorders.",

      "title": "Memory Impairment in Schizophrenia: Perspectives from Psychopathology and Pharmacotherapy",
      "abstract": "Objective: To describe the concept of memory impairment in schizophrenia and the clinical implications of this concept in terms of patient assessment and neuroleptic drug use. Method: Narrative literature review. Results: Individuals suffering from schizophrenia normally exhibit some degree of memory impairment. Recent work in psychopathology indicates that the impairment is comprehensive, involving the sensory, short-term, and long-term memory stores. Memory impairment appears to be a primary symptom of the disease, and its underlying causes are likely organic. A number of medications, however (for example, traditional neuroleptics and drugs that have pronounced anticholinergic activity), may cause or exacerbate impairment. In particular, anticholinergic agents used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms, a common complication of neuroleptic drugs, appear to have a deleterious effect on memory. Conclusions: Memory impairment is an important consideration in the clinical assessment and management of patients with schizophrenia. The use of atypical antipsychotics like risperidone appears to have no impact on memory function; because risperidone is associated with a low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects, it can obviate the need for anticholinergic medications—thus offering greater hope of nondebilitative intervention. The advent of medications that are safer (on cognition) could also lead to generally better outcomes by facilitating compliance with drug regimens and rehabilitation programs.",

      "title": "NONCONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS IN OLDER PEOPLE: A DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGE AND A TREATABLE CONDITION",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Lacking the typical phenotypic features of seizures and the adverse systemic consequences of prolonged convulsions, nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) was incorrectly assumed not to cause neuronal injury.1 Unfortunately, NCSE is associated with morbidity and mortality due to neuronal damage from abnormal electrical activity and its association with the acute neurological disorders that may precipitate it.2,3 This becomes more apparent in the geriatric population, in which impaired baseline mental status hampers diagnosis even further, and the brain parenchyma is more sensitive to prolonged abnormal electrical activity. To determine the prevalence, clinical features, and course of NCSE in the elderly population, an observational prospective study was conducted of all consecutive patients with acute unexplained change in mental,cognitive, or behavioral status or confusion that was the cause of hospitalization or had occurred during hospitalization in the Department of Geriatrics, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, over a 24-month period. Typical electroencephalogram (EEG) changes were required to establish the diagnosis of NCSE.4 Clinical improvement was defined as resumption of the previous (baseline) mental status and disappearance of epileptic activity on EEG. Within a 2-year period seven of 307 hospitalized patients, aged 73 and older, were diagnosed with NCSE (Table 1). Of the seven patients (4 women and 3 men, aged 73–90, mean age 82.7), only one had a previous history of epilepsy; three had renal insufficiency. All patients presented with acute altered mental state: confusion, stupor or coma, without concomitant clinical convulsive activity. In three patients, the presenting symptom was refusal to eat. Time until diagnosis ranged from 1 to 5 days (mean 3 days). All seven patients had generalized NCSE on EEG that disappeared with intravenous diazepam injection (5–8 mg) in the five patients to whom it was given and in all patients on follow-up. None of the patients had focal status epilepticus on EEG. Patients were treated with an intravenous loading dose of phenytoin (800–1,000 mg) or valproic acid (20 mg/kg) followed by a maintenance dose. In six patients, clinical improvement was achieved within 1 to 4 days (mean 2.2 days). None of the medications that the patients were taking are known to cause seizures. In the patients with renal failure, the clinical and encephalographic improvement was chronologically related to the antiepileptic treatment and not to renal function improvement. One patient died of sepsis 19 days after the diagnosis of NCSE. All other six patients were discharged from the hospital after they regained their previous mental and neurological status. We describe seven elderly patients with generalized NCSE. Although the diagnosis was delayed in all, they improved after diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Several features characterize the present series: old age (6 of 7 patients aged ≥80), high incidence (2.3%) of NCSE,5,6 only one patient with a previous history of epilepsy (unlike in other series in which up to 50% of patients were known to suffer from a convulsive disorder),2,3,7 and a benign outcome. Impairment of baseline cognitive abilities and confusion was the presenting symptom in five of seven patients. The fact that NCSE in most of the patients occurred under medical conditions that can cause acute mental status change highlights the diagnostic difficulty and the important role of EEG (sometimes at least as important as imaging) in the evaluation of abrupt mental or behavioral changes in the elderly population. Although the outcome of NCSE is variable, mortality has been reported to reach 50% in critically ill patients,6,8 and in the geriatric age group, NCSE might cause permanent neurological damage.9 Whether the good outcome in our series can be attributed, in part, to the fact that, in all these patients, epileptic activity was generalized and not focal, remains speculative. In addition, because a systemic, metabolic, or infectious condition (renal insufficiency, sepsis, or hypothermia) could have triggered the NCSE in five of seven, the reversibility of these causes may account, in part, for the relatively benign outcome. Although intravenous treatment of seizures is considered to be associated with morbidity and mortality in older people because of hypotensive, cardiac depressant and sedative effects of antiepileptic drugs,10 our experience suggests that, with the appropriate indications and when taking the proper precautions, such therapy is well tolerated in elderly patients with NCSE.",

It is well known that patients with depression often have deficits in verbal and visual memory, verbal fluency, attention and short-term memory. Some of these deficits have also been reported to be maintained beyond acute phases, during clinical remission and euthymia. Aims: To review current literature on cognitive deficits in major depressive disorder and its therapeutic approach.Methods: Non-systematic review of the literature available in the PubMed database using the keywords “depression”, “major depressive disorder”, “cognitive impairment”, “cognitive function”, “cognition”.Results and Conclusions: In some studies cognitive deficits in depression have been related with the use of antidepressant drugs. However, similar deficits were found in non-medicated patients who maintain residual cognitive deficits, even after adequate treatment and achievement of euthymia, with significant functional impairment. Variable patterns of cognitive deficits are found in patients receiving different antidepressants, when in remission of depressive episodes and without medication. The mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in major depressive disorder are not fully understood, but undoubtedly significantly impact patients’ lives. New therapeutic approaches towards cognitive complaints have been applied in these patients, such as cognitive remediation, previously used in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper argues that the lack of strong prospective evidence linking occupational and social stress to chronic disease stems from the failure of research designs to attend sufficiently to the aetiological chronicity of such diseases. Studies of both supposedly acute stress (life events) and chronic stress in life or work must increasingly be designed to distinguish between stress which is sustained or chronic over a period of yean or even decades, and hence capable of causing a serious chronic disease, and brief or transient stress, which may produce transient or brief psychological or physiological disturbances but cannot generate major chronic disease. Prospective studies are needed which collect measures of both stress and health or disease at multiple points over an extended period of time. Measures of stress should focus more on affect (for example, feelings of pressure and tension) than on cognition (for example feelings of satisfaction). Limited existing evidence is consistent with these ideals.",

      "abstract": "O delirium é uma síndrome neuropsiquiátrica comum em Unidades de Terapia Intensiva (UTIs), com uma prevalência que pode chegar a 50% em alguns estudos. Caracteriza-se por uma alteração aguda no estado mental, com prejuízo da atenção, cognição e consciência, e pode ser causado por disfunções orgânicas, intoxicação ou abstinência de substâncias. Fatores predisponentes incluem doenças neurológicas como Parkinson e Alzheimer, idade avançada, déficits sensoriais, e o uso de medicamentos neuropsiquiátricos. Já fatores precipitantes envolvem disfunções renais e hepáticas, infecções e o uso de certos medicamentos, como sedativos e opióides. O delirium pode ser classificado em três tipos: hiperativo, hipoativo e misto. O tratamento geralmente envolve a abordagem das causas subjacentes e intervenções não farmacológicas, como reorientação cognitiva e mobilização precoce. Porém, a condição também pode acarretar sequelas duradouras, com impacto na mortalidade, tempo de internação e custos hospitalares. O termo \"delirium\" tem origem no latim \"delirare\", que significa \"estar fora do caminho\", e foi integrado formalmente à psiquiatria no DSM-III, em 1980. O diagnóstico precoce é facilitado por ferramentas como o CAM-ICU e a ICDSC, enquanto intervenções ambientais, como controle de luz e som, também são essenciais para o manejo da condição.",

      "title": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Epilepsy: Overview and General Principles",
      "abstract": "The management of a patient with epilepsy requires the physician to address himself to two basic tasks: (1) an accurate diagnosis must be made with special attention to the possibility of progressive intracranial disease; and (2) an effective regimen for control of the seizures must be devised. DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGE Seizures beginning in infancy are accompanied, in about half of cases, by other evidence of cerebral damage, especially mental subnormality. The precise pathology often cannot be determined during life, although a cerebral developmental defect or birth injury is usually responsible. In a small proportion of cases a metabolic error, subdural hematoma, neuronal degenerative disease, or some other progressive process will be revealed by a history of deterioration in skills previously acquired. The diagnosis can then be established by other characteristic signs of the condition under consideration and appropriate laboratory studies. Grand mal, focal seizures and minor motor seizures are the types usually encountered in infancy. The same factors which commonly cause seizures in infancy continue to initiate seizures in childhood and early adolescence, but to a steadily decreasing extent. Thus, seizures due to a birth injury, like most post-traumatic seizures, usually begin within 24 months after the traumatic incident1; however, they may be delayed until late childhood or adolescence. Seizures appearing as a sequela of meningitis or other infections are sometimes similarly delayed. After the second year of life, seizures of unknown cause rapidly increase in incidence, including cases of so-called genetic epilepsy. In the latter, centrencephalic seizure bursts (3/sec wave and spike discharges) appear diffusely in the EEG, not only in patients, but in 45% of their asymptomatic siblings (aged 4 to 16 years), as well.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by severe and age-inappropriate levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder, and the majority of patients show comorbid or associated problems from other psychiatric disorders. Also, ADHD is associated with cognitive and motivational problems as well as resting-state abnormalities, associated with impaired brain activity in distinct neuronal networks. This needs to be considered in a multimodal treatment, of which neurofeedback may be a promising component. During neurofeedback, specific brain activity is fed-back using visual or auditory signals, allowing the participants to gain control over these otherwise unaware neuronal processes. Neurofeedback may be used to directly improve underlying neuronal deficits, and/or to establish more general self-regulatory skills that may be used to compensate behavioural difficulties. The current manuscript describes pathophysiological characteristics of ADHD, heterogeneity of ADHD subtypes and gender differences, as well as frequently associated behavioural problems such as oppositional defiant/conduct or tic disorder. It is discussed how neurofeedback may be helpful as a treatment approach within these contexts.",

These stages represent diverse neurobiological mechanisms that are differentially involved in the transition from recreational to compulsive drug use and from positive to negative reinforcement. The progression from recreational to compulsive substance use is associated with downregulation of the brain reward systems and upregulation of the brain stress systems. Individual differences in the neurobiological systems that underlie the processing of reward, incentive salience, habits, stress, pain, and executive function may explain (i) the vulnerability to substance-use disorder; (ii) the diversity of emotional, motivational, and cognitive profiles of individuals with substance-use disorders; and (iii) heterogeneous responses to cognitive and pharmacological treatments. Characterization of the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie individual differences in addiction-like behaviors is the key to understanding the mechanisms of addiction and development of personalized pharmacotherapy.",

However, more subtle neuropsychological impairment may be found in an individual who has almost no physical problems associated with alcohol abuse. The most common problems are short term memory loss, an inability to perform problem solving activities and difficulties with learning new skills. This has wide implications in an individual who needs to learn a new lifestyle which does not involve alcohol abuse.

      "title": "Cognitive Flexibility in Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Eating disorders are often associated with neuropsychological traits of rigid and inflexible cognition and behavior. Cognitive flexibility refers to the ability to effectively adapt to changes in the environment and/or changing task demands by selectively altering one’s thoughts, responses and/or behaviors. It can be assessed using several different neurocognitive tasks, including those that measure set-shifting and task-switching. This chapter will summarize the state of the science of cognitive flexibility deficits in individuals with eating disorders. Cognitive flexibility deficits in neuropsychological tasks appear to be most pronounced among individuals with anorexia nervosa and may be less characteristic of other eating disorders. Implications for a discrepancy in findings between objective and subjective measures of cognitive flexibility are also provided, as well implications for therapeutic interventions.",

MATERIAL and METHODS:The experiment was performed on six WAG/Rij rats, a validated strain for genetic absence seizures.The animals were underwent VNS and the effects were investigated on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings at 22, 24, 26 hours of stimulation and 15 days after the cessation, for duration of spike and wave complexes (SWC), the numbers, mean duration of SWC and frequencies in an hour. RESULTS:EEG recordings demonstrated that the mean duration of SWC was 353.1 seconds and the number of activity per hour was 62 at the baseline.There were statistically significant decreases in the total duration of SWC and the number of activities (61.8% and 78% decrease, respectively).There were no significant decreases in the mean duration of SWC and the frequencies. CONCLUSION:The acute stimulation of the vagal nerve caused a statistically significant decrease both in overall duration of SWC and the number of complexes in an hour.Moreover, the positive effects seemed to last even 15 days after the cessation of the stimulation.Further studies focusing on different stimulation parameters and delayed effects of the VNS on human absence seizures are warranted.",

In particular, assessment of immediate and later follow-up treatment of psychotic patients (1) indicates that moderate doses are adequate for most patients, (2) fails to support the utility of unusually high doses, and (3) even suggests the existence of a biphasic relationship of antipsychotic efficacy to dose of neuroleptics and possibly to plasma concentrations of the drugs as well. Trends toward lesser overall clinical benefits of high doses may reflect untoward extrapyramidal or other central nervous system effects leading to behavioral and cognitive symptoms. Thus, moderate doses of neuroleptics appear, on average, to be about as effective as, and probably safer than, the larger doses that have been popular in the United State in recent years.",

Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment.Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions. Those with strong external motivation may do well on the antagonist naltrexone. Currently, optimum duration of maintenance on either is unclear.

We have done an electronic bibliographical research in MEDLINE using the following key words: psychiatric disorders, amphetamine, stimulants, marijuana, cannabis, long term effects, psychosis, cognitive and cognitive deficits. The marijuana might induce permanent psychosis in subjects with vulnerability to schizophrenia or to psychosis. The cognitive effects are acute and subacute, related with the presence of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the central nervous system. The stimulants can produce a schizophrenia-like psychosis, and they can produce long term cognitive deficits. The stimulants also might produce subsyndromic mood disorders.",

Slowing of the heart rate and weight gain are distinguishing features of tobacco withdrawal. Although nicotine withdrawal may not produce medical consequences, it lasts for several weeks and can be severe in some smokers. Like most other drug withdrawals, nicotine withdrawal is time‐limited, occurs in non‐humans, is influenced by instructions/expectancy and abates with replacement therapy and gradual reduction. Unlike some other drug withdrawal syndromes, protracted, neonatal or precipitated withdrawal does not occur. Whether nicotine withdrawal is associated with tolerance, acute physical dependence, greater duration and intensity of use, rapid reinstatement, symptom stages, cross‐dependence with other nicotine ligands, reduction by non‐pharmacological interventions and genetic influences is unclear. Whether nicotine withdrawal plays a major role in relapse to smoking has not been established but this is also true for other drug withdrawal syndromes.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain and Depression: Understanding 2 Culprits in Common: Does a Shared Pathophysiology Hold the Key to Managing These Conditions When They Coexist?",
      "abstract": "[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Any discussion of the relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD) and chronic encounters an obstacle immediately: Neither has a singular pathophysiology. Furthermore, MDD and, to a significant extent, chronic are defined more by their symptoms than by a presumed etiology and pathogenesis. Why does this matter to a busy clinician? Explicitly or implicitly, we often align our treatment approaches with what we assume is the underlying pathophysiology of the conditions we are addressing. An overview of shared pathophysiology of chronic conditions and MDD therefore can be useful in practice. What is chronic pain? Defined as pain that persists past the healing phase following an injury, (1) chronic often is subdivided into 4 types (2,3): * nociceptive (caused by a lesion or potential tissue damage) * inflammatory * neuropathic (spontaneous or hypersensitivity to related to neurologic illness or injury) * functional (hypersensitivity to due to abnormal central processing of a normal input). Although fibromyalgia often is categorized as a dysfunctional syndrome, persons who suffer from it, much like those who suffer neuropathic pain, commonly report hyperalgesia (augmented sensitivity to painful stimuli), allodynia (abnormal response to non-noxious stimuli), and paresthesias. These shared clinical features of fibromyalgia and neuropathic are consistent with central sensitization, which suggests overlapping pathophysiology. (4) Comorbidity between depression and is common. A 30% to 60% co-occurrence rate of MDD and chronic has been reported. (5) Some subtypes of chronic pain, such as fibromyalgia, are so commonly comorbid with psychiatric conditions that they have spawned a scientific debate as to whether the conditions are most parsimoniously considered (1) separate illnesses with high comorbidity or (2) different symptomatic manifestations of a single underlying condition. (6) Moreover, cumulative evidence suggests that chronic and depression do not just co-occur; each one facilitates development of the other, such that chronic is a strong predictor of subsequent onset of MDD, and vice versa. When and depression are comorbid, they also tend to make treatment of each condition more difficult. For example, presents (1) a major obstacle to achieving remission when treating depression (7,8) and (2) significant risk of relapse. (9) A 3-year longitudinal study showed that painful symptoms substantially reduced the chance of recovery in a group of older depressed patients (n = 327). A substantially greater percentage of patients with MDD alone attained recovery (47%), compared with only 9% in whom MDD and painful symptoms were comorbid. (10) Furthermore, a higher level of can delay remission when treating MDD, (11) thus reducing the likelihood of an optimal outcome. (12) Understanding shared processes. Recent developments in neuroscience and psychoimmunology point to the fact that comorbid and depression might be driven by overlapping pathophysiological processes in the brain and body. In the 2 parts of this article, we (1) review scientific understanding of these shared processes and (2) demonstrate how recent advances in the epidemiology, phenomenology, and etiology of chronic and MDD provide important clues for more effective diagnosis (Part 1) and treatment (Part 2, March 2016)--and, therefore, better outcomes. Our focus is primarily on the relationship between MDD and the best-studied comorbid chronic conditions: fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, chronic back pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. The societal burden of chronic conditions is enormous A recent epidemiological study (13) projected that as many as 100 million people in the United States--30.7% of the population--suffer some form of chronic pain, including arthritis and joint pain. …",

      "abstract": "Insomnia may be categorized as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. The ideal hypnotic must promote rapid sleep onset and maintain sleep throughout the night while allowing the patient to awake refreshed the following day. Several benzodiazepines, with differing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles are presently available. All are clinically effective and not only elimination half-life but also dosage prescribed and pattern of distribution are important factors for determining treatment response. Hypnotics have been divided into those with long elimination half-lives (e.g. nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam), those with intermediately long half-lives (brotizolam, loprazolam, lormetazepam, temazepam) and those with short half-lives (midazolam and triazolam). Carry-over effects into the morning such as excessive daytime sleepiness or drowsiness are related to drug half-life, dosage and pattern of distribution. In equipotent dosages most controlled clinical trials have found no significant differences between the various benzodiazepine hypnotics. Nevertheless, clinicians in general tend to use long half-life benzodiazepines in patients who have difficulties maintaining sleep and short half-life benzodiazepines for treating sleep onset insomnia. Intermediately long half-life, benzodiazepines are used for both indications and most clinicians feel that the choice of hypnotic should not only be influenced by elimination half-life or the dosage used, but by individual patient preference. Hypnotics should be used for only short periods of time and in those patients for whom a more chronic use is indicated, they should be used only on an intermittent basis.",

      "abstract": "Guidelines for the determination of death by neurologic criteria (DNC) require an absence of confounding factors if clinical examination alone is to be used. Drugs that depress the central nervous system suppress neurologic responses and spontaneous breathing and must be excluded or reversed prior to proceeding. If these confounding factors cannot be eliminated, ancillary testing is required. These drugs may be present after being administered as part of the treatment of critically ill patients. While measurement of serum drug concentrations can help guide the timing of assessments for DNC, they are not always available or feasible. In this article, we review sedative and opioid drugs that may confound DNC, along with pharmacokinetic factors that govern the duration of drug action. Pharmacokinetic parameters including a context-sensitive half-life of sedatives and opioids are highly variable in critically ill patients because of the multitude of clinical variables and conditions that can affect drug distribution and clearance. Patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors that influence the distribution and clearance of these drugs are discussed including end organ function, age, obesity, hyperdynamic states, augmented renal clearance, fluid balance, hypothermia, and the role of prolonged drug infusions in critically ill patients. In these contexts, it is often difficult to predict how long after drug discontinuation the confounding effects will take to dissipate. We propose a conservative framework for evaluating when or if DNC can be determined by clinical criteria alone. When pharmacologic confounders cannot be reversed, or doing so is not feasible, ancillary testing to confirm the absence of brain blood flow should be obtained.",

      "abstract": "Delirium oppstår oftest etter kirurgi og under intensivbehandling, og er en akutt forvirringstilstand på grunn av forstyrrelser i hjernens funksjoner. Patofysiologien er uklar, men delirium har en identifiserbar organisk årsak. Forløpet er fluktuerende og kan utvikle seg over tid. Symptomene kan være desorientering, hukommelsessvikt, hallusinasjoner og persepsjonsforstyrrelser (1). Pasientene blir svært sårbare fordi de har redusert evne til å ta del i, påvirke, eller kontrollere egen situasjon (2). Intensivmiljøet inneholder fysiske, psykiske og miljømessige faktorer som kan utløse et delirium, for eksempel respiratorbehandling, sedasjon, alvorlighetsgrad av kritisk sykdom, mangel på døgnrytme og farmakologisk påvirkning. Predisponerende faktorer som demens eller kognitiv dysfunksjon, depresjon, alvorlig sykdom eller komorbiditet er også tilstede hos pasienten før sykehusinnleggelse (3, 4). Det er rapportert om delirium hos nær 87% av alle respiratorbehandlede pasienter. Ubehandlet delirium kan påvirke pasientens kliniske tilstand, og føre til redusert kontinuitet i behandlingen, lengre behandlingstid, økte kostnader og i verste fall økt mortalitet (5). Pasientens adferd deles inn i hyperaktivt og hypoaktivt delirium, eller en kombinasjon av begge tilstandene. Hyperaktivt delirium er klassisk beskrevet som at pasienten er aggressive og utagerende, og ute av stand til å samarbeide. Hypoaktivt delirium viser seg ved svekket oppmerksomhet og bevissthet, og nedsatt psykomotorisk aktivitet. Det er høyest forekomst av pasienter i hypoaktivt delirium. På grunn av vage symptomer er det vanskeligere å avdekke. Dette fører til at langtidsprognosen for pasienter med hypoaktivt delirium er dårlig (5, 6). Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) er et validert kartleggingsverktøy som benyttes for å avdekke tilstanden hos intuberte pasienter som ikke kan kommunisere verbalt (4, 7, 8). Rutinemessig screening med et slikt kartleggingsverktøy for å avdekke delirium er anbefalt. Likevel viser forskning at tilstanden er underdiagnostisert (9, 10).",

Due to the absence of specific symptoms, it is frequently misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder, which delays treatment. The cases of two patients who exhibited psychiatric symptoms and subtle cognitive disturbances (without confusion) as the sole manifestation of frontal lobe NCSE are reported. Both patients were initially treated as psychiatric disorders (depression and anorexia nervosa). The correct diagnosis was established by the electroencephalographic study, in one case after the patient experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and in the other, after failure to improve with supposedly adequate treatment. There are reports of patients with NCSE whose symptoms suggest a psychiatric disorder (inappropriate behavior, emotional disinhibition, perseveration, reduced speech and motivation). This can occur without altered consciousness and symptoms may fluctuate, making the correct diagnosis extremely difficult. This entity can occur at any age and without a previous history of seizures. A high level of suspicion is necessary for prompt electroencephalographic study to confirm the diagnosis. Early treatment will correct the symptoms and significantly improve quality of life for patients and their families.",

Signs and symptoms of AW can include, among others, mild to moderate tremors, irritability, anxiety, or agitation. The most severe manifestations of withdrawal include delirium tremens, hallucinations, and seizures. These manifestations result from alcohol-induced imbalances in the brain chemistry that cause excessive neuronal activity if the alcohol is withheld. Management of AW includes thorough assessment of the severity of the patient's symptoms and of any complicating conditions as well as treatment of the withdrawal symptoms with pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Treatment can occur in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Recognition and treatment of withdrawal can represent a first step in the patient's recovery process.",

Recent studies indicate that impairment of the normal structure and function of microglia, caused by either intense inflammatory activation (e.g., following infections, trauma, stroke, shortterm stress, autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases) or by decline and senescence of these cells (e.g., during aging, Alzheimer's disease, or chronic unpredictable stress exposure), can lead to depression and associated impairments in neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Accordingly, some forms of depression can be considered as a microglial disease (microgliopathy), which should be treated by a personalized medical approach using microglial inhibitors or stimulators depending on the microglial status of the depressed patient.",

      "abstract": "The acute use of alcohol and several other licit and illicit drugs can affect mental state and cognitive function. The chronic use of certain drugs may also increase the risk of cognitive impairment and perhaps dementia in later life. This paper focuses on the long-term cognitive consequences of using alcohol, benzodiazepines, tobacco and cannabis. Currently available evidence indicates that mild to moderate alcohol consumption is not associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and may in fact have a protective effect against dementia, although heavy, long-term consumption is likely to have a negative impact on cognitive function. The degree that alcohol-related cognitive impairment must reach to be classified as dementia is currently obscure. Longer-term smoking is associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and possibly dementia. The chronic use of benzodiazepines has been associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment but information relating to dementia remains inconclusive. The chronic use of cannabis may impair intellectual abilities but data on this topic remain sparse and difficult to interpret. In conclusion, there is evidence that some drugs contribute to the causal pathway that leads to the development of cognitive impairment but currently available data do not support the introduction of a separate diagnostic category of drug-induced dementia (such as alcohol-related dementia). Health promotion programs designed to decrease tobacco smoking and \"harmful\" alcohol use (and possibly other drug use) may decrease the burden of cognitive impairment and perhaps dementia in later life.",

This corresponds to a prolonged alteration of the mental state with continuous or sub-continuous generalized spikes or spike-wave discharges on the EEG. The prototype is absence status (petit mal status, spike-wave stupor, minor epileptic status),13,14 where there is clouding of awareness but, presumably, no specific cognitive deficit. Apathy, drowsiness, slowness, inattention, perplexity, strange affect, amnesia, slow speech are the most obvious abnormal behaviors. It is not clear to what degree higher-level mental functions are truly preserved and what new memories can be formed during these episodes: detailed studies are rare.15These NCSE can be phases in primary generalized epilepsies, but may be manifestations of complex partial status epilepticus of temporal or frontal origin.15 In temporal partial status epilepticus, only limited purposeful organized activity and responses to outside stimuli are possible and there is usually a total amnesia for the period. The epileptic nature is recognized by the presence, often subtle, of automatic motor behavior and vegetative phenomena.16,17 A special form of frequent refractory nonconvulsive partial status epilepticus, associated with ring chromosome 20, is probably of frontal origin and, because it is so frequent, should allow exploration of the affected and preserved behaviors and memories during seizures.18,19",

Cierto deterioro se acepta universalmente, sin concretarse factores relevantes productores, generalmente multifactoriales. Analizamos la relacion neuropsicologia/ epilepsia en neuropediatria. Desarrollo. La relacion epilepsia/comportamiento debe considerarse una excepcion y no la regla, salvo que coexistan trastornos de personalidad y/o deficiencia mental. Los efectos cognitivos de los FAE dependen del farmaco, de la dosis utilizada y de la polifarmacia; estos efectos son tanto adversos como favorables. Las diferencias entre farmacos son criticables, ya que dosis adecuadas monitorizadas producen efectos adversos generalmente leves, valorados fiablemente (MIDDRA). El tiempo de escalada es importante, en especial con algunos nuevos FAE. Los mecanismos de produccion son variados, pero el conocimiento del mecanismo de accion mejora el funcionamiento cognitivo gracias al control de la crisis. En la infancia existen reacciones cognitivas idiopaticas. Las principales son disminucion del tiempo de reaccion y del procesamiento de informacion con alteracion de la memoria, la atencion y el lenguaje. Conclusiones. La epilepsia se asocia a diversos problemas cognitivos generalmente leves. La edad de inicio, el tipo de sindrome, la etiologia, la respuesta terapeutica y la polifarmacia son elementos multifactoriales condicionantes de efecto adverso.

      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

Diagnosis may be missed and treatment inadequate if symptoms are attributed solely to aging or to life's circumstances. Proper dosage is determined by the patient's age and metabolic capabilities, and patient education increases compliance. Although the patient may deny the need for psychotherapy, continued support and a life review help the patient acquire insights and adjust to changes. The patient can sustain progress by keeping active, pursuing interests, and socializing. The aim of long-term antidepressant pharmacotherapy is to reduce morbidity, restore productive and optimal functioning, and enhance the quality of life. The attainment of previous levels of function is the gauge of success.",

Primary impairment of episodic memory often results in reduced semantic and autobiographic memory. Neuropsychological performance predicts academic achievement and everyday life functioning while subjective memory complaints are highly correlated with depression. Memory impairment is also influenced by initial brain damage, developmental retardation and dynamic factors (e.g., seizure frequency, medication). Damage of functional tissue, low mental reserve capacity, and poor seizure outcome increase the risk for postsurgical memory impairment whereas functional release due to seizure freedom counteracts negative impact. Preliminary findings indicate that postsurgical training improves memory deficits and encourage further research.",

Following the ingestion of a benzodiazepine, short-term memory is not affected, but longterm memory is impaired. The memory loss may occur because events are not transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory and thus not consolidated into memory storage. Information stored prior to the ingestion of a benzodiazepine is not affected. Memory impairment is more likely in benzodiazepines that have a high benzodiazepine-receptor affinity, that accumulate in the body, that are given in high doses or intravenously, or that are eliminated slowly. Individuals taking benzodiazepines are often unaware of their memory impairment unless it is pointed out to them. Elderly clients experiencing memory impairment may be embarrassed to mention the problem. Alternatives to prescribing benzodiazepines include antidepressant medications, exercise or psychotherapy. When prescribing a benzodiazepine, it is important to fully inform patients of the drug's potential side effects and to maintain the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time.",

      "title": "A Review of the Biological Mechanisms of Dexmedetomidine for Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorders",
      "abstract": "Postoperative neurocognitive disorders are common neurological complications following surgery that are generally characterized by varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Postoperative neurocognitive disorders can exhibit as short-term postoperative delirium and/or long-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In addition, postoperative neurocognitive disorders may result in poor outcomes in patients, and are a leading cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality, particularly in elderly patients. Recently, there has been a heightened interest in mechanisms and clinical treatments for postoperative neurocognitive disorders. Though some influencing factors and mechanisms of postoperative neurocognitive disorders have been revealed, they remain troublesome problems in clinical departments. Dexmedetomidine is a commonly used anesthetic adjuvant that may help improve postoperative cognitive impairment, especially the conditions of a postoperative acute event (postoperative delirium, within 1 week after operation) and delayed neurocognitive recovery (postoperative cognitive dysfunction, up to 30 days). In the recent literature, dexmedetomidine has been shown to exert positive effects on cognitive impairment in clinical and animal studies, especially for postoperative neurocognitive disorders. However, not all clinical findings support this efficacy. Though some mechanisms of dexmedetomidine on postoperative neurocognitive disorders have been proposed, such as signaling pathways associated with inflammation and apoptosis, this evidence is fragmentary and disputed in the literature. Therefore, this article aims to review the potential biological mechanisms underlying dexmedetomidine's effects on postoperative neurocognitive disorders, providing a reference for future studies.",

The most significant abnormality is that which is termed posthypoxic and/or postresuscitation encephalopathies whose nature has not been elucidated particularly at the cellular and molecular levels. It is emphasized that this involves brain abnormalities, which is a sequela of hypoxia or ischemia of systemic origin, rather than primary brain damages. In some patients who have sustained a severe hypoxic episode of any nature and recovered their psychoneurological status ever rapidly and rather fully, there may be an abrupt progressive deterioration of their neurological status in some days or months, which results in death or grave irreversible disability. It is concluded that not only do reparative and compensatory processes occur, but also there are phenomena of progressive degenerative changes in a primarily successfully resuscitated person or experimental animal in the central nervous system in the postresuscitation period. A classification of psychoneurological disorders in patients in the early postresuscitation period has been made and ways of their prevention or alleviation have been indicated.",

Whatever scheme is used, however, it is essential that the type and level of anxiety is assessed before undertaking drug treatment. In general, tranquillizers such as benzodiazepines are more effective in lessening acute or chronic sustained levels of anxiety than peaks, as in panic attacks. With sustained levels of anxiety, long-acting benzodiazepines such as diazepam and clorazepate are usually preferred, while episodic anxiety normally responds best to shorter-acting drugs such as oxazepam or lorazepam. Short-term use of benzodiazepines is justified in patients with severe symptomatic distress and/or impairment of ability to cope. Long-term use is only justified in patients with chronic severe anxiety in which the symptomatic relief and improved functioning outweigh the risk of dependence.",

      "abstract": "Mortality rates alone are no longer a sufficient guide to quality of care. Due to medical advances, patients are surviving for longer following critical illness and major surgery; therefore, functional outcomes and long-term quality of life are of increasing consequence. Post-operative cognitive dysfunction has been acknowledged as a complication following anaesthesia for many years, and interest in persistent cognitive dysfunction following a critical illness is growing. Psychological and neurocognitive sequelae following discharge from intensive care are acknowledged to occur with sufficient significance to have recently coined the term 'the post-intensive care syndrome'. Rehabilitation following critical illness has been highlighted as an important goal in recently published national UK guidelines, including the need to focus on both physical and non-physical recovery. Neuropsychological and cognitive consequences following anaesthesia and critical illness are significant. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms linking delirium, cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychological symptoms following critical illness are not fully elucidated but have been studied elsewhere and are outside the scope of this article. There is limited evidence as yet for specific peri-operative preventative strategies, but early management and rehabilitation strategies following intensive care discharge are now emerging. This article aims to summarise the issues and appraise current options for management, including both neuroprotective and neurorehabilitative strategies in intensive care.",

      "abstract": "The term dysautonomia refers to a change in autonomic nervous system function that adversely affects health. The changes range from transient, occasional episodes of neurally mediated hypotension to progressive neurodegenerative diseases; from disorders in which altered autonomic function plays a primary pathophysiologic role to disorders in which it worsens an independent pathologic state; and from mechanistically straightforward to mysterious and controversial entities. In chronic autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson disease), orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure from sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after “patchy” autonomic impairment or blood volume depletion or, as highlighted in this discussion, from a primary abnormality that augments delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart. Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys seems to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm that is associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, which rationalizes treatment with β-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between the chronic fatigue syndrome and orthostatic intolerance; however, treatment with the salt-retaining steroid fludrocortisone, which is usually beneficial in primary chronic autonomic failure, does not seem to be beneficial in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Dysautonomias are an important subject in clinical neurocardiology.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> To design a classification concentrating on the art and severity of functional restriction that could include all possible postoperative neurological disturbances and prove its validity to be comparable and easily used in neurosurgery. A seven grade classification was proposed commencing from grade \"0\" for no neurological disturbances to grade \"6\" for coma/vegetative state/demise: grade “1”, any remittent neurological disturbances with full improvement spontaneously or as a result of any temporary drug therapy or re-surgery, a single epileptic seizure without the need for anticonvulsant therapy; grade “2”, lasting neurological disturbances resulting in no functional restrictions, no epileptic seizures needing for long-term anticonvulsant therapy; grade “3”, lasting neurological disturbances resulting in slight functional restrictions, rare epileptic seizures despite of anticonvulsant therapy, slight aphasia; grade “4”, lasting neurological disturbances resulting in moderate functional restrictions and partial need of outside help, average frequency of epileptic seizures despite anticonvulsant therapy, moderate aphasia; and grade “5”, lasting neurological disturbances resulting in severe functional restriction and complete need of outside help, high frequency of epileptic seizures despite of anticonvulsant therapy, severe aphasia. The study included a total of 1681 operations at 1530 patients. The postoperative neurological disturbances occurred in 7.7% (n=119) of patients. All postoperative neurological disturbances could be easily classified according to the CPNC. The ranking system was proportional to the length of hospital stay. The CPNC is useful and easily applicable to assess the rates of postoperative neurological disturbances. It can be a comparable instrument in the quality management of neurosurgery.",

      "title": "On the Misdiagnosis of Non-epileptic Seizures as Tonic-Clonic Seizures: Challenges and Recommendations",
      "abstract": "Many seizures are a result of epilepsy. In contrast, other episodes, known as non-epileptic seizures(NES), are not caused by abnormal electrical signals in the brain and are, therefore, not a direct cause of epilepsy; however, NES episodes are commonly misdiagnosed as tonic-clonic seizures. The misdiagnosis of NES episodes can result in the inapt use of antiepileptic drugs, which have no beneficial effect for people with NES and are commonly used to prevent further epilepsy-induced seizures, leading to the high risk of side effects and the unnecessary payment for these expensive medications. Other consequences of misdiagnosis include limitations on education and employment prospects, the underlying condition going unrecognized and untreated, and a decline in the quality of life of the subject. Although an electroencephalogram(EEG) can be utilized to detect if a convulsion is a result of epilepsy, the test is not entirely accurate and can all the same result in misdiagnosis and its subsequent consequences. It is vital that the EEG is improved to avoid the negative ramifications of the misdiagnosis of NES as tonic-clonic seizures. In this paper, significant flaws with the EEG and other tests used to diagnose tonic-clonic seizures are addressed and characterized in terms of their specificity and sensitivity, and methods to reduce unnecessary brain waves in brain mapping and neuroimaging such as sedation are proposed. Furthermore, auxiliary solutions such as making alterations in the placements and types of electrodes to the conventional method(10/20 system) when performing an EEG as well as alternate tests are considered with the goal of increasing the true positive rate of the diagnosis of epilepsy.",

The frequency and severity of the psychological disturbances are difficult to determine because many factors confound the interpretation of evidence whether it results from open case reports, controlled clinical trials, or neuropsychological testing. Concern about potential problems should not preclude trying an AED if other properties make the agent otherwise appropriate because the occurrence of adverse effects is often unpredictable in any given individual. Impairment can be minimized by gradual titration of dose and limiting total dose as clinically possible. If psychological problems arise and fine titration of the AED cannot eliminate the problem, the drug can be discontinued without permanent life threatening sequellae.",

      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

      "abstract": "Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is a neurocognitive dysfunction that is present in the majority of patients with cirrhosis. MHE has a characteristic cognitive profile that cannot be diagnosed clinically. This cognitive dysfunction is independent of sleep dysfunction or problems with overall intelligence. MHE has a significant impact on quality of life, the ability to function in daily life and progression to overt hepatic encephalopathy. Driving ability can be impaired in MHE and this may be a significant factor behind motor vehicle accidents. A crucial aspect of the clinical care of MHE patients is their driving history, which is often ignored during routine care and can add a vital dimension to the overall disease assessment. Driving history should be an integral part of the care of patients with MHE. The preserved communication skills and lack of specific signs and insight make MHE difficult to diagnose. The predominant strategies for MHE diagnosis are psychometric or neurophysiological testing. These are usually limited by financial, normative or time constraints. Studies into inhibitory control, cognitive drug research and critical flicker frequency tests are encouraging. These tests do not require a psychologist for administration and interpretation. Lactulose and probiotics have been studied for their potential use as therapies for MHE, but these are not standard-of-care practices at this time. Therapy can improve the quality of life in MHE patients but the natural history, specific diagnostic strategies and treatment options are still being investigated.",

Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

Treatment of delirium focuses on finding the cause and managing the symptoms, often with the use of pharmacologic agents.

Furthermore, MMN can serve as a measure of recovery or neural reorganization in different neurological disorders. For example, the recovery from aphasic symptoms after stroke was associated with the enhancement of MMN. MMN has also been useful in determining neural plastic changes of the auditory system associated with cochlear implantation.",

      "title": "Perioperative Management of Acute Central Nervous System Injury",
      "abstract": "Neural function is essential to human existence. Thus, loss of any neural element in the course of a critical illness represents a major loss to a given individual. Neurons or supporting elements may be lost in a small, virtually unnoticeable manner, perhaps manifest as cognitive or behavioral deficit, or there may be widespread selective neuronal loss or tissue infarction with more apparent and disabling deficits. Based on the notion that neural function is the essence of acceptable survival from critical illness, it is crucial for perioperative management to include considerations of neural viability and the impact and interactions of the primary diseases and therapeutics on the nervous system. There are numerous perioperative scenarios where a patient may present with neurologic dysfunction. In a general sense, these scenarios often involve ischemia, trauma, or neuroexcitation. Each of these, as they progressively worsen, at some point typically involve a period of decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), usually resulting from elevated intracranial pressure, eventually compromising cerebral blood flow sufficiently to produce permanent neuronal loss, infarction, and possibly brain death. A variety of biochemical pathways play a major role. Optimization of perioperative outcome after injury to the central nervous system (CNS) is a multifactorial process requiring skillful and well-informed anesthetic and critical care management. However, none of these interventions is risk-free, and extensive knowledge and expertise are very important to ensure a fine balance between the benefits and risks of specific interventions. By the end of this chapter, the anesthesia provider should have a general understanding of how to address the most commonly encountered complications in the acutely injured central nervous system.",

Some involve genetic or metabolic disturbances affecting the muscle directly, some are caused by interruptions to the transmission of impulses at the neuromuscular junction, still others by abnormalities in the muscle nerve supply. Disuse atrophy with profound weakness may be seen in advanced arthritis or in any other condition where chronic pain enforces immobility. There are numerous uncommon syndromes in which muscle weakness is an important component; many of these will come to a specialist neurologist for elucidation. Some weakness is temporary, recovery of strength often occurs in stroke or very commonly in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Cranial motor and peripheral muscular dysfunction in myasthenia gravis may respond to steroids, immuno-suppressants and either plasma exchange or immunoglobulin infusions as well as thymectomy and the use of pyridostigmine. There are presentations of ‘functional’ weakness (often unilateral and sometimes accompanied by sensory symptoms) commonly of prolonged duration, that are little altered by treatment of any kind, but are not readily assigned to any recognizable neurological diagnosis. This group of disorders reminds us that weakness is a subjective as well an objective and measurable symptom.",

      "title": "THE RELATION OF NEURORECURRENCES TO LATE SYPHILIS",
      "abstract": "Immediately after the introduction of arsphenamine there was recognized a type of precocious neurosyphilis to which was given the name neurorecurrence (Neurorezidive). As usually accepted, this term is limited to a syndrome consisting of the sudden appearance of symptoms and signs of involvement of the central nervous system in a patient with early (primary or secondary) syphilis, who has received an amount of treatment insufficient to eradicate the infection, and has then lapsed from treatment. The clinical manifestations are varied, but usually consist of an acute or subacute syphilitic meningitis, commonly with, but sometimes without, focal lesions of the cranial nerves. The early literature on this subject was filled with a controversy as to whether these lesions were caused by the harmful effects of arsenicals or by syphilis. The controversy has long since been settled. Neurorecurrences are due, not to arsphenamine, but to too little arsphenamine; the symptoms usually disappear",

      "title": "Syncope And Related Paroxysmal Spells",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal spells are non-epileptic, paroxysmal events that may mimic epileptic seizures but are not associated with rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons typical of seizures. They clinically manifest as a transient loss of consciousness, often occurring suddenly, with or without a prodrome. Paroxysmal spells can be caused by psychological disorders such as substance abuse and psychiatric disease or physiological events such as hypoglycemia, traumatic brain injury, and syncope. Psychological Conditions Data suggest that men with psychiatric disease have an increased incidence of syncope or paroxysmal events of unknown etiology. This data should lead clinicians to consider screening for psychiatric disorders in patients with transient loss of consciousness they cannot identify with a clear etiology.Among patients with a history of substance use disorder, 45% have been found to have unexplained syncope. This suggests that prior and current substance use is also associated with increased incidence of transient loss of consciousness of unknown etiology. Patients evaluated in the emergency department or even hospitalized with syncope of unknown etiology may benefit from toxicology screening and possible detoxification referral. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is defined as low blood sugar with associated symptoms. In patients without diabetes mellitus, this is usually manifested at glucose levels below 50 mg/dl. To diagnose hypoglycemia, symptoms and blood sugar must improve with exogenous glucose. Hypoglycemia can affect the central nervous system, leading to lightheadedness, nausea, flashes of light, focal neurological deficits, transient loss of consciousness, and seizure. It is, therefore, paramount that patients with any paroxysmal spell or syncope receive a fingerstick glucose. Traumatic Brain Injury Traumatic brain injury is an intracranial impairment, often due to external forces. These forces may include blunt or penetrating trauma to the head, causing acceleration/deceleration injury to the cerebral cortex. Intracerebral bleeding, lacerations, and diffuse axonal injuries may result. Injuries, such as an epidural hematoma, may cause a brief state of loss of consciousness, with rapid return of, usually, altered consciousness. Other injuries, such as large subdural hematoma or diffuse axonal injury may cause worsening mentation and coma over hours to days. This is a result of increased intracranial pressure, leading to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, and finally, neuronal ischemia. Diagnosis is by clinical history and CT imaging, although MRI may be more specific for secondary trauma. Management is to reduce intracranial pressure and edema. Syncope As most paroxysmal events are syncopal, the remainder of this discussion will focus primarily on syncope. Physiologically, syncope is a transient loss of consciousness as a result of cerebral hypoperfusion. As such, syncope varies from other etiologies of loss of consciousness in that it does not include head trauma or a post-ictal state. Syncope instead results in complete and rapid resolution of mental status. It may have myoclonic jerking, but no generalized tonic-clonic movement. Rather than a disease, syncope is a symptom of an underlying pathology ranging from benign to life-threatening. Patients are often divided into low-risk and high-risk groups. The etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, treatment, and management of these patients vary greatly. In the United States, hospitalization costs for syncope are estimated to be $5300 per admission and more than $2 billion annually. These costs are higher than those of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma combined. As extensive workups can be costly, time-consuming, and often unnecessary, a growing cadre of management tools has been devised to evaluate patients with syncope. These tools are tailored to determining the etiology of the syncopal event and treating dangerous, high-risk, syncope patients.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

      "abstract": "Normal aging and depression both slow information processing speed which leads to poorer attentional control, shallower inhibition monitoring, poorer encoding, poorer updating of short term memory, and subsequent poorer learning, set-shifting, error monitoring, inhibition control, and cognitive planning. A combination of aging and depression amplifies these cognitive effects. Deterioration in frontal brain functioning in normal aging is irreversible, but altering of frontal brain function due to depression may be reversible. Since the symptoms are indistinguishable, it is difficult to separate effects of depression and aging with use of neuropsychological tests, even when premorbid history is known. Statistical group effects show more severe cognitive effects in late life depression than in normal aging or depression in younger persons, but no particular cognitive markers of depression in older subjects have been identified. Attention and inhibition are closely related, but their relationship needs to be studied further. It is not clear, whether a problem with inhibition of irrelevant stimuli occurs because of attentional deficits due to late life depression, or if it is a primary consequence of the depression. Further studies on the relationship between inhibition, attention and processing speed involving homogeneous depressed and non-depressed groups of different age may help disentangle this relationship.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is seen by the insurance industry and many health care providers as an \"event.\" Once treated and provided with a brief period of rehabilitation, the perception exists that patients with a TBI require little further treatment and face no lasting effects on the central nervous system or other organ systems. In fact, TBI is a chronic disease process, one that fits the World Health Organization definition as having one or more of the following characteristics: it is permanent, caused by non-reversible pathological alterations, requires special training of the patient for rehabilitation, and/or may require a long period of observation, supervision, or care. TBI increases long-term mortality and reduces life expectancy. It is associated with increased incidences of seizures, sleep disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, neuroendocrine dysregulation, and psychiatric diseases, as well as non-neurological disorders such as sexual dysfunction, bladder and bowel incontinence, and systemic metabolic dysregulation that may arise and/or persist for months to years post-injury. The purpose of this article is to encourage the classification of TBI as the beginning of an ongoing, perhaps lifelong process, that impacts multiple organ systems and may be disease causative and accelerative. Our intent is not to discourage patients with TBI or their families and caregivers, but rather to emphasize that TBI should be managed as a chronic disease and defined as such by health care and insurance providers. Furthermore, if the chronic nature of TBI is recognized by government and private funding agencies, research can be directed at discovering therapies that may interrupt the disease processes months or even years after the initiating event.",

      "abstract": "Neuro psychiatric illnesses are commonly recognised these days in the intensive care especially with the increasing aging population and more intensive care admissions. However they are still inadequately diagnosed and treated disease entities as a majority of these patients do not seek the help of specialists psychiatrists Of course the number of drugs used in psychiatry has explosively increased in recent years. As a corollary to this, the phenomenon of drug- drug interaction between psychiatric drugs and other drugs has come to the forefront. Drug- drug interaction (DDI)) is the response (pharmacological or clinical) of altered drug effects or increase in adverse effects when two or more drugs are used simultaneously1,2 This effect may be different from the usual action of the individual drugs when used alone. Potential drug- drug interaction (PDDI) are those where theoretically there may be an interaction between the drugs but have not clinically occurred.1,2.Shobhana A.

They can, however, markedly diminish withdrawal symptoms and craving, and block opioid effects due to lapses. The most effective withdrawal method is substituting and tapering methadone or buprenorphine. alpha-2 Adrenergic agents can ameliorate untreated symptoms or substitute for agonists if not available. Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment. Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions. Those with strong external motivation may do well on the antagonist naltrexone. Currently, optimum duration of maintenance on either is unclear. Better agents are needed to impact the brain changes related to addiction.",

      "title": "Axonal injury following mild traumatic brain injury is exacerbated by repetitive insult and is linked to the delayed attenuation of NeuN expression without concomitant neuronal death in the mouse",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) affects brain structure and function and can lead to persistent abnormalities. Repetitive mTBI exacerbates the acute phase response to injury. Nonetheless, its long‐term implications remain poorly understood, particularly in the context of traumatic axonal injury (TAI), a player in TBI morbidity via axonal disconnection, synaptic loss and retrograde neuronal perturbation. In contrast to the examination of these processes in the acute phase of injury, the chronic‐phase burden of TAI and/or its implications for retrograde neuronal perturbation or death have received little consideration. To critically assess this issue, murine neocortical tissue was investigated at acute (24‐h postinjury, 24hpi) and chronic time points (28‐days postinjury, 28dpi) after singular or repetitive mTBI induced by central fluid percussion injury (cFPI). Neurons were immunofluorescently labeled for NeuroTrace and NeuN (all neurons), p‐c‐Jun (axotomized neurons) and DRAQ5 (cell nuclei), imaged in 3D and quantified in automated manner. Single mTBI produced axotomy in 10% of neurons at 24hpi and the percentage increased after repetitive injury. The fraction of p‐c‐Jun+ neurons decreased at 28dpi but without neuronal loss (NeuroTrace), suggesting their reorganization and/or repair following TAI. In contrast, NeuN+ neurons decreased with repetitive injury at 24hpi while the corresponding fraction of NeuroTrace+ neurons decreased over 28dpi. Attenuated NeuN expression was linked exclusively to non‐axotomized neurons at 24hpi which extended to the axotomized at 28dpi, revealing a delayed response of the axotomized neurons. Collectively, we demonstrate an increased burden of TAI after repetitive mTBI, which is most striking in the acute phase response to the injury. Our finding of widespread axotomy in large fields of intact neurons contradicts the notion that repetitive mTBI elicits progressive neuronal death, rather, emphasizing the importance of axotomy‐mediated change.",

      "title": "Molecular mechanisms of drug resistance in status epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency, characterized by continuous or intermittent seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures, which can result in death or neurologic sequelae. In about one-third of patients, SE is unresponsive to sequential treatment with first- and second-line antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The two most important variables that influence the response of SE to AEDs are the underlying etiology and the duration of SE (Neligan & Shorvon, 2008). With respect to etiology, acute structural brain disorders (e.g., encephalitis, stroke, and trauma) resulting in SE in previously nonepileptic patients are particularly likely to be refractory. Conversely, in cases of acute SE in previously nonepileptic patients, for which no etiology is found, the outcome is usually much better. With respect to duration of SE, the longer the seizure persists (typically >1 h), the more likely is the seizure to be unresponsive to AED therapy, the higher is the mortality, and the worse is the prognosis in survivors. Similar observations have been reported in rat models of SE. In rats, SE can be induced with chemical agents or by electrical stimulation. Chemical models of SE include systemic administration of the convulsants kainic acid or pilocarpine, whereas electrical models include hippocampal or amygdala stimulation via depth electrodes. In such models, seizures rapidly become self-sustaining and continue long after the withdrawal of the convulsive stimulus. Various molecular and functional changes are thought to play a role in the transition from single seizures to self-sustained SE and in the development of time-dependent pharmacoresistance in rat SE models (Chen & Wasterlain, 2006; Wasterlain & Chen, 2008). These changes include alterations in the functional properties of hippocampal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors and enhanced trafficking of GABAA receptors (or receptor subunits) from the synaptic membrane to the cytosol, resulting in a loss of GABA-mediated inhibition. At the same time, glutamate receptor subunits, including alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtypes, move to the synaptic membrane where they form additional excitatory receptors. These changes are likely to explain progressive resistance to AEDs acting on GABAA receptors, whereas anticonvulsant NMDA or AMPA antagonists remain highly effective in terminating SE (Wasterlain & Chen, 2008). These findings, however, do not easily explain resistance to AEDs, such as phenytoin, that do not primarily act via GABA receptors. It is conceivable that AED targets other than GABA or glutamate receptors are also affected by sustained seizure activity. For instance, molecular and functional changes in voltage-dependent sodium channels, which are targets of phenytoin and various other major AEDs, have been found after a pilocarpine-induced SE in rats (Ellerkmann et al., 2003; Remy & Beck, 2006). Furthermore, a decrease in surface expression of potassium channels has been described after prolonged SE (Lugo et al., 2008). Another explanation for the progressive loss of AED efficacy with ongoing SE activity would be increased expression of drug efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) at the blood–brain barrier, which would decrease brain concentrations of AEDs that are substrates for Pgp (Löscher, 2007). However, recent experiments in two rat models of SE did not result in any evidence supporting this possibility (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008; Kuteykin-Teplyakov et al., 2009). Pgp expression at brain capillary endothelial cells was not increased during or shortly after SE, but only 2 days following SE. This was substantiated by studying the mRNA expression of the genes (Mdr1a, Mdr1b) encoding for Pgp in rats. Furthermore, the selective Pgp inhibitor, tariquidar, did not counteract resistance of a pilocarpine-induced SE to phenobarbital or phenytoin (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008). In our hands, the only effective treatment for terminating a pilocarpine-induced SE was a combination of phenobarbital and diazepam (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008), which may be explained by the fact that phenobarbital, in addition to modulating GABAA receptors, blocks glutamatergic excitation at AMPA/kainate receptors (Rogawski & Löscher, 2004), so that combining these two AEDs results in a synergistic effect on GABAA receptors plus an antiglutamatergic effect. Other potential mechanisms of drug resistance of SE include induction of proinflammatory mediators and neuronal damage. SE has been shown to induce cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα); complement; and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, that is, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins in the brain (Vezzani & Granata, 2005). The induction of these mediators may be involved in alterations in the blood–brain barrier, increased neuronal hyperexcitability, and neuronal degeneration, all of which may affect AED efficacy. However, at least in our hands, induction of proinflammatory mediators by SE did not develop rapidly enough to explain resistance of SE to AEDs (Kuteykin-Teplyakov et al., 2009). These alterations, however, may be critically involved in the development of epilepsy and neuronal damage after SE, as indicated by the disease-modifying effects of treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, administered after a pilocarpine-induced SE (Jung et al., 2006). Interestingly, neurodegeneration developing after SE could be significantly reduced or prevented by treatment with the NMDA-antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine), administered together with diazepam after kainate- or pilocarpine-induced SE (Brandt et al., 2003; Bankstahl et al., 2008), substantiating that SE-induced release of glutamate is involved in brain damage. Therefore, combining diazepam with an NMDA antagonist such as ketamine may not only be an advantageous treatment for terminating SE (Martin & Kapur, 2008; Wasterlain & Chen, 2008), but may also prevent part of the long-term consequences of SE. Apart from molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, the severity of SE may play a role in the response to AED treatment. We recently demonstrated in rats that SE induced by pilocarpine was more resistant to AEDs than an electrically induced SE, and also induced more severe brain damage than determined in the electrical model (Bankstahl & Löscher, 2008). So one may speculate that drug resistance, at least in part, is a mere expression of higher SE severity (and/or the severity of the underlying condition), rather than of molecular or functional alterations developing as a result of sustained seizure activity. In conclusion, mechanisms of drug resistance in SE are only incompletely understood. Important variables that influence the response of SE to AEDs are the underlying etiology and the duration of SE, but several other variables may be involved, including disease-related, patient-related, and drug-related factors (Table 1). Initiating treatment of SE with two drugs that have different mechanisms of action (e.g., a benzodiazepine plus a barbiturate or an NMDA antagonist) might increase chances of success. It is hoped that a better understanding of the factors and mechanisms involved in refractory SE might help us to improve its treatment.

Although polypharmacy is known to increase the risk of iatrogenic neurological conditions, the recovery of cognitive function after drug withdrawal has been rarely documented in psychiatric patients using standardized neuropsychological methods. We present a neuropsychological case report of patient SN, a 41-year-old woman who developed a socially and occupationally detrimental condition of cognitive dysfunction likely induced by long-term exposure to lithium and other psychiatric medications. To shed light on SN's cognitive deficits and their recovery after drug withdrawal, neuropsychological assessments were conducted before, and approximately 2 years after, lithium and other psychiatric drugs were discontinued. Selective cognitive impairments were observed before drug discontinuation in visuomotor speed, visuoperceptual reasoning and delayed visual memory. Partial, but not complete, recovery of function was observed 2 years after drug withdrawal.",

      "title": "Poor insight in psychosis and meta-representation models",
      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

      "title": "Confusional status epilepticus in elderly",
      "abstract": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by prolonged impairment of consciousness of variable entity, often associated with myoclonias or automatisms. EEG shows continuous paroxysmal activity or electrographic discharges. When NCSE occurs in older patients, differential diagnosis with other conditions such as stroke or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, may be difficult and a high degree of suspicion is required. Emergency EEG represents the most important means of investigation in such cases. According to ictal EEG, NCSE may be classified as generalized (including typical and “de novo” absence status) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Absence status, or ‘petit mal’ status, is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It can occur in the context of different types of generalized idiopathic epilepsies, or ‘de novo’, with onset usually in the elderly, precipitated by toxic or metabolic factors in subjects with no previous history of epilepsy [1]. Ictal EEG shows continuous or almost continuous generalized spike and polyspike and wave discharges. Clinical and EEG normalization occurs after i.v. benzodiazepines (BDZ) in most cases. The prognosis of “de novo” absence status is generally good and recurrences are rare [1]. In CPSE, impairment of consciousness may be continuous or fluctuating, but it is usually clinically very difficult to distinguish from absence status. CPSE may occur in patients with preexisting epilepsy, at times precipitated by AEDs withdrawal, or in subjects with acute or remote cerebral lesions. Ictal EEG shows continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. CPSE tends to recur and may be difficult to treat (response to i.v. BDZ in ~ 60% of patients) [2]. Cognitive and behavioral sequelae have been rarely reported, thus prompting an early recognition and treatment of such a condition. Mortality is also rare, mostly depending on etiology, but may reach up to 26,3% in the elderly. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively [3].",

In the absence of cognitive impairment, it is benign oblivion, more and more common with advancing age. It is not possible today to conclude on later risk of dementia, since the studies are contradictory on this point. In contrast, subjective complaints of memory are often associated with depression or increased by certain medications they are primarily associated, in the representations of the patients or their surroundings, to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.

It is a condition resulting either from the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms, which leads to abnormally, prolonged seizures. This definition provides a good guidance, when emergency treatment must be considered. In general, time point t1 is the time when treatment should be started, which is at 5 minutes for generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and at 10 min for focal seizures with or without impairment of consciousness. Time-point t2 marks the time at which neuronal damage or self-perpetuating alteration of neuronal networks may begin and indicates that SE should be controlled latest by that time; 30 min in case of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. All treatment protocols recognize a staged approach to treatment with different drugs used in early (stage I), established (stage II), refractory (stage III) and super-refractory SE (stage IV); and emphasize prompt recognition and treatment of persisting seizure activity at each stage aiming to reduce morbidity, mortality, and long-term consequences of status epilepticus (beyond t2).",

These have been attributed to a resulting inability to increase hepatic glucose output acutely. A more important consequence may be reduced awareness of impending hypoglycaemia. Such hypoglycaemia unawareness is related to, but not entirely explained by, diminished sympathetic activity, perhaps due to failure to activate the sympathoadrenal system until a lower blood glucose level is achieved. The patient's subsequent failure to act appropriately would then be due to impaired cerebral function preventing the perception of sympathoadrenal activation during the more severe hypoglycaemia. Unawareness of moderate hypoglycaemia is common in diabetic patients. Autonomic neuropathy probably accounts for only a few cases of hypoglycaemia unawareness and other factors which are potentially important include duration of diabetes, glycaemic control, insulin species, and the degree and frequency of hypoglycaemia. Further research is required to discover both the pathophysiological mechanisms of, and the treatment needed to reverse or prevent, the abnormality.",

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

The adaptive changes that occur are coordinated and mediated by the stress system in the central nervous system (which includes corticotrophin-releasing hormone and noradrenergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem, respectively), and its peripheral limbs, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic (sympathetic) system. Controlled or self-driven challenges to homeostasis and a normally functioning stress system are crucial for normal development and preservation of self and species. In childhood and adolescence, appropriately functioning neuroendocrine responses to stressors are necessary to allow growth and psychosexual maturation to progress normally. Maladaptive neuroendocrine responses, i.e. dysregulation of the stress system, may lead to disturbances in growth and development and cause psychiatric, endocrine/metabolic and/or autoimmune diseases or vulnerability to such diseases, not only during childhood and adolescence, but also in adulthood.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is the most common neurologic condition in children and is characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy can be diagnosed after a first unprovoked seizure if characteristic clinical and electroencephalographic features suggest a high risk of future seizures. Epilepsy is classified based on seizure type, underlying causes, and potential electroclinical syndromes. This classification guides management and predicts its effectiveness. Some epilepsy syndromes resolve spontaneously (ie, are self-limited) or improve with management (ie, are pharmacoresponsive). Syndromes that contribute to intellectual disability, referred to as developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, are not self-limited, are unlikely to improve with management (ie, are pharmacoresistant), and are associated with poor long-term outcomes. Antiseizure drugs are the mainstay of epilepsy management. Some broad-spectrum drugs are used to manage multiple seizure types, and others have indications for specific seizure types or epilepsy syndromes. Dietary therapy, surgical resection, and neuromodulation may be options if drugs do not control seizures. Neurodevelopmental and mental conditions are common in children with epilepsy. These include intellectual disability, learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, and anxiety. Patients with epilepsy should undergo screening for these associated conditions as part of routine care. Physicians should instruct caregivers and family members on how to manage seizures, including use of rescue drugs.",

      "abstract": "Adverse events in childhood and adolescence, such as social neglect or drug abuse, are known to lead to behavioral changes in young adulthood. This is particularly true for the subset of people who are intrinsically more vulnerable to stressful conditions. Yet the underlying mechanisms for such developmental trajectory from early life insult to aberrant adult behavior remains elusive. Adolescence is a period of dynamic physiological, psychological, and behavioral changes, encompassing a distinct neurodevelopmental stage called the 'critical period'. During adolescence, the brain is uniquely susceptible to stress. Stress mediators may lead to disturbances to biological processes that can cause permanent alterations in the adult stage, even as severe as the onset of mental illness when paired with genetic risk and environmental factors. Understanding the molecular factors governing the critical period and how stress can disturb the maturation processes will allow for better treatment and prevention of late adolescent/young adult onset psychiatric disorders.",

Los principales factores de riesgo son la hipertensión arterial, la diabetes mellitus, la enfermedad renal crónica (ERC), contrastes hiperosmolares, cantidad de contraste infundida y su infusión directa en el territorio cerebral posterior, o patologías que cursen con daño de barrera hematoencefálica. La sintomatología es inespecífica y puede presentarse como alteración del nivel de conciencia, focalidad neurológica o crisis comiciales. El diagnóstico es de exclusión tras haber descartado los accidentes cerebrovasculares (ACV) isquémicos o hemorrágicos; el TC o la resonancia magnética (RM) son de utilidad para su diferenciación. Generalmente aparece poco tiempo tras la exposición y la sintomatología dura 48-72 h con recuperación completa, aunque se han descrito casos con persistencia de los síntomas o mayor duración. El tratamiento es la monitorización con medidas de soporte y la terapia de sustitución renal con hemodiálisis (HD) en aquellos pacientes en programa crónico.

Contrast-induced encephalopathy is a neurological complication related to contrast used in endovascular procedures or computed tomography (CT). The main risk factors are arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperosmolar contrasts, the amount of infused contrast and its direct infusion in the posterior cerebral territory, or pathologies with blood–brain barrier damage. Symptomatology is non-specific and may present as altered level of consciousness, neurological focality or seizures. Diagnosis is done by exclusion after ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke has been ruled out; CT or MRI are useful for differentiation. Generally, it appears shortly after exposure and the symptoms lasts 48–72 h with complete recovery, although cases with persistence of symptoms or longer duration have been described. Treatment consists of monitoring, supportive measures and renal replacement therapy (RRT) with hemodialysis (HD) in patients in chronic RRT program. It is important for the nephrologist to be aware of this entity given the susceptibility of the patient on HD as well as its potential therapeutic role in these patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

It occurs more often with high potency and depot forms, frequently 3 to 9 days after initiation and sometimes years later, and is not related to dose or previous exposure. About 40% of cases had evidence of an affective disorder. NMS apparently results from deficient compensatory mechanisms following blockade of dopaminergic regulation of muscle tone and autonomic function. Possible indicators of vulnerability and various treatments are discussed. Neuroleptic challenge resulted in recurrence of symptoms in about one third of cases.

      "title": "A Clinical Profile of Coma",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nImpaired consciousness is among the most difficult and dramatic of clinical problems. The brain tolerates only limited physical or metabolic injury, so that impaired consciousness is often a sign of impending irreparable damage to the brain. Stupor and coma imply advanced\r\nbrain failure, just as, for example, uremia means renal failure, and the longer such brain failure lasts the narrower the margin between recovery and the development of permanent neurologic injury. The limited time for action and the multiplicity of potential causes of brain\r\nfailure challenge the physician. The physician must organize available information to anticipate as accurately as possible the likelihood that the patient will either recover or remain permanently disabled. Prospective studies of prognosis in adults and children\r\nindicate that within a few hours or days after the onset of coma, neurologic signs and electrophysiologic markers in many patients differentiate, with a high degree of probability, the extremes of no improvement or good recovery. Unfortunately, radiologic and biochemical indicators have generally provided less accurate predictions of outcome, with some exceptions.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nTo determine the incidence, etiology, and outcome of coma, to determine the commonest causes of coma, to recognize unusual presentations and to assess the prognosis in these patients.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nA total of 100 consecutive patients admitted in a comatose state to the IMCU/medical ward in Government Stanley Medical College, were enrolled in this study after prior written and informed consent.\r\nPeriod of the Study: February 2010 To April 2010.\r\nMETHODOLOGY:\r\nA detailed case history was taken.Depression of consciousness was assessed by the GCS. A detailed clinical examination was done.Investigations were guided by the clinical presentation. Neurological outcomes were determined as intact(normal or no change from\r\npre-morbid condition), impaired (alteration of tone,power or reflexes,cranial nerve dysfunction, ataxia, seizures, persistent vegetative state) or death.\r\nInclusion Criteria:\r\n• Cases with coma &focal signs,\r\n• Those without focal signs,\r\n• Cases with coma & fever.\r\nExclusion Criteria:\r\n• Head injury.\r\n• Toxin ingestion.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe GCS is a valuable tool but it may not account for the localized motor, speech and language deficits associated with a focal lesion and hence its accuracy may be affected which has an impact on its prognostic value. The presence of pupillary /eye signs may not portend a poor prognosis in all cases especially in hypoxic injury.\r\nThe initial GCS may be deceptively low in alcoholics. Caution is required while interpreting the clinical findings in alcoholics. There may be difficulties in differentiating the more serious injuries from reversible signs.\r\nThe presence of seizures in a comatose patient may not always signify a poor prognosis in all cases.\r\nThe limitations of our study are that it is an observational study and the number of patients\r\nanalyzed may not be significant to apply the results to a larger population. The observed proportion might represent the lower limit of a confidence interval rather than the mean. Also, actual outcome from the illness in many instances could be worse than the best neurologic state because some patients who recovered temporarily (48 hrs) died of complications later.\r\nA multimodal work up including brain CT, MRI, EEG, somatosensory evoked potentials and clinical examination might be useful in predicting accurate prognosis than any of them alone.",

      "title": "Co‐factors for smoking and evolutionary psychobiology",
      "abstract": "Smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated in people with co-factors such as depression, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and bulimia/bingeing. These behavioral or cognitive patterns may be adaptive or neutral in the conditions under which we evolved but maladaptive in environments requiring alertness for extended periods, where a fully mobilized fight-or-flight response is inappropriate, and where food availability makes lack of an \"appestat\" a liability. Such conditions are amenable to management by nicotine because of its ability to produce small but reliable adjustments in relevant cognitive and behavioral functions. Moreover, symptomatology may be unmasked or exacerbated by nicotine abstinence, persisting beyond the usual time-course for nicotine withdrawal, which may explain the particular attraction of smoking and the difficulty these individuals experience in quitting without necessarily requiring that they be more nicotine-dependent. The implications are: (1) a better understanding of the evolutionary psychobiology of smoking may promote development of tailored interventions for smokers with co-factors; (2) nicotine may have therapeutic applications for non-smokers with co-factors; (3) because smoking has a fairly high heritability index, and because of evidence of assortative mating, special prevention efforts targeting children of smokers with co-factors, as well as early identification of the co-factor itself, may be needed.",

      "abstract": "Acute symptomatic seizures (ASS) occur at the time or in close temporal association with a documented systemic or brain insult and are a common cause for seeking an emergency neurological opinion. The major issues involved in their management are the diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause, whether seizures should be treated or not, the choice of anti-epileptic drug (AED) and the duration of AED treatment. These decisions are not straightforward and currently no clear guidelines exist to guide management in this area. We outline our current practice which is based on the evidence available on risks of seizure recurrence, and on our own experience. Most ASS only need short term therapy (up to 3 months) if there is complete recovery from the acute insult. Patients with residual structural brain abnormalities with focal neurological deficit and/or MRI changes need long term prophylactic treatment. We make suggestions for minimum duration of treatment for ASS associated with some common conditions, including—subarachnoid and intracerebral haemorrhage—1 year; ischaemic stroke and venous sinus thrombosis—1 year; mild to moderate head injury—acute seizure control only; severe head injury—2 years; metabolic and toxic disorders (including alcohol withdrawal)—correction of underlying cause only; meningoencephalitis with complete recovery and normal MRI—3 months, residual focal deficit and/or MRI changes—2 years; cerebral abscess, tuberculoma—2 years; parasitic granuloma—if completely resolved with normal MRI—3 months, if persistent/calcified—2 years.",

The great question of importance is to distinguish the two states or conditions when the result—intemperance—is the same. We must observe whether there are symptoms in our patient which can be referred to primary disease of the nervous system. We must examine for hereditary influences, which, when present, lead us, of course, to suspect disease.

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

However, this damage is not diffuse and predominantly affects specific cerebral networks, resulting in a particular pattern of spared and impaired cognitive abilities. Disruption of fronto-cerebellar, Papez's, decision-making and reward/motivation circuits are associated with deficits of executive functions and working memory, episodic memory and decision-making, as well as reduced motivation to change, respectively. These neuropsychological disabilities can hamper treatment of alcohol dependence and can also indirectly interfere with successful treatment outcomes. Cognitive impairments may impede positive treatment outcome by interrupting treatment processes, which in turn mediate the influence of impairment on these outcomes. Deficits may also serve to moderate the influence of treatment processes by reducing or enhancing their influence on treatment outcomes. Neuropsychological impairments must therefore be detected at treatment entry and taken into account to provide the most appropriate treatment.",

The pathophysiology remains obscure; physical investigations are usually performed to exclude pathology rather than elucidate dysfunction. However, modern neuroimaging has allowed the study of nervous system structure and function. Although there are few diagnostically specific findings, patterns of association have emerged: where action is impeded (certain forms of conversion disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome) frontal systems of the brain are often implicated; when subjective awareness of the body is disturbed (passivity phenomena and anorexia nervosa) temporo-parietal cortices appear to be dysfunctional. The caudate nuclei (components of the frontal executive circuit) are implicated in a variety of syndromes (including body dysmorphic disorder, somatisation and chronic fatigue). The brain may be viewed as a cognitive neurobiological entity, crucially oriented towards action (for survival). Psychiatric syndromes that have an impact on bodily awareness signal dysfunction within systems representing that body and its performance in time and space.",

      "abstract": "The quantities of alcohol consumed by many people nowadays overwhelm the body's natural defense mechanisms and lead to dependence, a range of physical and mental disorders, and serious individual, interpersonal, and societal problems. The peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) after a single amount of alcohol is reached 30-45 minutes after ingestion, depending on the rate of absorption and whether food has been taken. Alcohol is a pharmacological intoxicant that suppresses the brain and the rest of the central nervous system. Alcohol interferes with the ability to form new memories, particularly when it is taken in intoxicating amounts. Mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced memory impairments include disruption of neurotransmission in the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a central role in the formation of new memories. A common consequence of clinically significant alcohol intoxication is memory loss for events that occurred while the person was intoxicated—a form of anterograde amnesia.",

Chronicity in primary depression was significantly correlated with a positive family history of affective disorder, multiple losses through death of family members, disabled spouses, concurrent incapacitating medical diseases (especially their treatment with depressant antihypertensive drugs), and secondary sedativism (including alcoholism). No correlation was found with childhood loss of a parent or severity of depressive episodes.",

Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

      "title": "When does Parkinson's disease begin?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Pathological and neuroimaging studies have shown that in Parkinson's disease (PD) there is a “subclinical” or “premotor” period during which dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) degenerate but typical motor symptoms have not yet developed. Post‐mortem studies based on nigral cell counts and evaluating dopamine levels in the striata, and imaging studies assessing the nigrostriatal pathway in vivo, have estimated that this time period could last 3 to 6 years. In addition, emerging evidence indicates that the neuropathological process of PD does not start in the SN but more likely elsewhere in the nervous system: in the lower brainstem and the olfactory bulb, or even more distant from the SN, such as in the peripheral autonomic nervous system. Patients with PD frequently can present non‐motor symptoms, such as hyposmia or constipation, years before the development of classical motor signs. The physiopathology of these “premotor” symptoms, though still unclear, is currently thought to be related to early involvement by the pathological process underlying PD of non‐dopaminergic lower brainstem structures or autonomic plexuses. However, the answer to the question “when does PD start” remains uncertain. Here, we review clinical, pathological, and neuroimaging data related to the onset of the pathological process of PD, and propose that its onset is non‐motor and that non‐motor symptoms could begin in many instances 10 and 20 years before onset of motor symptoms. The variable course of the disorder once the motor symptoms develop, suggests that the start and progression of premotor PD is also highly variable andgiven the heterogeneous nature of PD, may differ depending on the cause/s of the syndrome. When and where the neuropathological process develops in PD remains uncertain. © 2009 Movement Disorder Society",

A chronic illness has a lengthy duration, uncertain outcome, and unpredictable episodes, often with intrusive symptoms and intermittent or progressive disability. Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Individuals who complain of insomnia report repeated difficulty with either initially falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia) or remaining asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep. Their sleep is described as short and inadequate, light and easily disrupted, of poor quality, unrefreshing, unsatisfactory, or nonrestorative. Frequent extended periods of wakefulness or persistent early morning awakenings may be reported. In children, insomnia may present as bedtime resistance or lack of ability to sleep independently. This sleep disturbance is associated with impairment of daytime function. Most investigators define insomnia as a sleep latency of 30 minutes or more; wake time after sleep onset of 30 minutes or more; sleep efficiency of less than 85%; or total sleep time less than 6 to 6.5 hours, occurring at least 3 nights a week. Patients with insomnia often report greater subjective sleep disturbance compared to objective polysomnographic parameters. The discrepancy between subjective estimates and objective measures of sleep is believed to be due to persistent sensory processing during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which decreases the ability of patients with insomnia to distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Perception of sleep appears to be altered. Persons with insomnia may have a greater tendency to describe, when awakened from sleep, of being awake all along, compared with those without insomnia. In addition, they may overestimate the duration of their sleep latencies.",

Drugs affecting several neurotransmitters were developed, such as the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which, as the name suggests, inhibited the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, and they have become increasingly popular. The SNRIs now being marketed are not only used in the treatment of depressive disorders, but serve in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia , and relief of menopausal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

The additional effect of CSE characteristics on outcomes after CSE and whether prolonged seizures cause any long-term hippocampal injury which leads to developmental or memory impairment is uncertain. This review provides an overview of long-term prognosis after childhood CSE, highlighting data from recent literature. Findings: In previously normal children, the long-term prognosis after childhood CSE is favorable, with low incidence of epilepsy, motor, and cognitive difficulties. Mesial temporal sclerosis is uncommon in children after prolonged febrile seizures. In children with symptomatic causes and those with pre-existing neurological abnormalities, there is substantial morbidity after childhood CSE. Etiology is the primary determinant of outcome after childhood CSE and the additional effect of CSE characteristics such as seizure duration seems to be less than previously believed.",

      "abstract": "Harmful alcohol use is responsible for a group of disorders collectively named alcohol use disorders (AUDs), according to the DSM-5 classification. The damage induced by alcohol depends on the amount, time, and consumption patterns (continuous and heavy episodic drinking). It affects individual global well-being and social and familial environments with variable impact. Alcohol addiction manifests with different degrees of organ and mental health detriment for the individual, exhibiting two main traits: compulsive drinking and negative emotional states occurring at withdrawal, frequently causing relapse episodes. Numerous individual and living conditions, including the concomitant use of other psychoactive substances, lie in the complexity of AUD. Ethanol and its metabolites directly impact the tissues and may cause local damage or alter the homeostasis of brain neurotransmission, immunity scaffolding, or cell repair biochemical pathways. Brain modulator and neurotransmitter-assembled neurocircuitries govern reward, reinforcement, social interaction, and consumption of alcohol behaviors in an intertwined manner. Experimental evidence supports the participation of neurotensin (NT) in preclinical models of alcohol addiction. For example, NT neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala projecting to the parabrachial nucleus strengthen alcohol consumption and preference. In addition, the levels of NT in the frontal cortex were found to be lower in rats bred to prefer alcohol to water in a free alcohol–water choice compared to wild-type animals. NT receptors 1 and 2 seem to be involved in alcohol consumption and alcohol effects in several models of knockout mice. This review aims to present an updated picture of the role of NT systems in alcohol addiction and the possible use of nonpeptide ligands modulating the activity of the NT system, applied to experimental animal models of harmful drinking behavior mimicking alcohol addiction leading to health ruin in humans.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common brain disorder in the elderly. In most patients who develop dementia the core syndrome of cognitive dysfunction is superimposed over the course of the disease by behavioral disorders that manifest at least temporarily to varying degrees. These include depression, anxiety, agitation, restlessness, aggression, disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle, delusions and hallucinations. Classical psychiatric exploration can be complemented by the use of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) which allows structured diagnosis and comparative documentation of the clinical course. The majority of psychotropic drugs used in psychogeriatics have not been specifically developed for or tested in elderly, often multimorbid patients. Substances used in psychogeriatrics are subject to special requirements due to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes specific to very old persons. They must show clinical efficacy and a low rate of cardiovascular, peripheral and central anticholinergic effects, a low delirogenic potential and favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Most of the newer atypical neuroleptics (e.g. risperidone) and the newer antidepressants (e.g. from the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, or selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, SNRIs) tend to fulfill these criteria better than the high-potency neuroleptics of the butyrophene type (e.g. haloperidol) or the tricyclic antidepressants. For that reason, these newer products should usually be preferred over the conventional agents.",

      "abstract": "The frequency of sleep disruption and the degree to which insomnia significantly affects daytime function determine the need for evaluation and treatment. Physicians may initiate treatment of insomnia at an initial visit; for patients with a clear acute stressor such as grief, no further evaluation may be indicated. However, if insomnia is severe or long-lasting, a thorough evaluation to uncover coexisting medical, neurologic, or psychiatric illness is warranted. Treatment should begin with nonpharmacologic therapy, addressing sleep hygiene issues and exercise. There is good evidence supporting the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy. Exercise improves sleep as effectively as benzodiazepines in some studies and, given its other health benefits, is recommended for patients with insomnia. Hypnotics generally should be prescribed for short periods only, with the frequency and duration of use customized to each patient's circumstances. Routine use of over-the-counter drugs containing antihistamines should be discouraged. Alcohol has the potential for abuse and should not be used as a sleep aid. Opiates are valuable in pain-associated insomnia. Benzodiazepines are most useful for short-term treatment; however, long-term use may lead to adverse effects and withdrawal phenomena. The better safety profile of the newer-generation nonbenzodiazepines (i.e., zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopidone, and ramelteon) makes them better first-line choices for long-term treatment of chronic insomnia.",

The minor side effects may include headache, muscle pain, nausea rarely associated with vomiting, confusion and post treatment agitation. Memory disturbance is usually limited to impaired short term memory during the treatment course and for a few weeks following the completion of the course. Adolescents who have been evaluated months or years following ECT do not differ significantly from those who did not receive this treatment. Prolonged seizures may be somewhat commoner in adolescents than in adults and may be prevented and treated by appropriate steps. No fatalities, which could be directly attributed to ECT, have been ever reported in this age group.",

      "abstract": "Dementia represents decline in cognitive functioning which interferes with working ability and social skills. Dementia can be divided in two categories, reversible and irreversible dementia, depending on what was the cause of illness. Since symptoms of dementia are overlapping with symptoms of depression and delirium (both treatable conditions), one should be careful when diagnosing dementia. Most common and most important type of irreversible dementia is Alzheimer’s dementia. Aggregation of senile plaques and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins are still in focus when talking about the pathophysiology of the disease. The increase of oxidative stress and therefore changes in functioning of neurons both lead to neurological decline. Progressive decline in cognitive functioning, inability to perform everyday activities, behavioral changes and dependence on help of family members or medical personnel are some of the symptoms of dementia. Significant cognitive deprivation in the majority of diseased can lead to behavioral impairment. People with dementia are prone to delusions and hallucinations, which makes their treatment quite challenging. Since there is no cure for dementia, only symptomatolitic remedies are being used. These drugs reduce symptoms of dementia, but also delay admission to nursing homes. Currently used drugs are NMDA receptor antagonist memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors- rivastigmin, galantamin and donepezil. Memantine decreases impact of glutamate on oxidative stress of neurons and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors restore loss of cholinergic pathways by inhibiting breakdown of acetylcholine in synaptic cleft. Behavioral and psychotic symptoms are treated with antipsychotics and benzodiazepines.",

Normal aging, depression, and anxiety are commonly associated with memory difficulties, as are many neurologic conditions. Systemic illnesses can impair memory by injuring vulnerable limbic regions sensitive to hypoxia or hypoglycemia. Commonly used over-the-counter and prescription medications can likewise cause amnesia. These conditions disrupt memory in characteristic ways. Recent studies suggest that immediate, recent, and remote memory functions have different neuroanatomic substrates, as do the processes of registration, retention, and retrieval. New classifications have emerged to explain the evidence for multiple memory subsystems. The neuropharmacology of memory now includes several peptides in addition to cholinergic and noradrenergic pathways. Critical limbic regions have been discovered that mediate memory consolidation, and neuronal mechanisms such as long-term potentiation are being implicated in the unique capacity of these areas to permit new learning to take place.",

They are safe for individuals in recovery from alcoholism or drug dependence. Depression is no longer attributed simply to too little neurochemicals such as serotonin or norepinephrine. Instead, depression is associated with a dysregulation of neurochemical firing patterns. Antidepressants treat specific symptoms of depression such as depressed mood, sadness, fatigue and suicidality, and they also regulate the altered brain chemistry that may contribute to these symptoms.",

Here, we report a 60‐year‐old male patient who presented with a sudden onset of disorientation and short‐term memory loss and started to ask about his whereabouts and what happened. He had no significant past medical or psychiatric disorder. Likewise, the patient did not have a recent history of head trauma, substance abuse, loss of consciousness, seizure disorder, or migraine. Neurologic examination was normal except for mild disorientation and short‐term memory impairment. He had a score of 18/30 on the mini‐mental state examination. Extensive laboratory investigations did not show any abnormal findings. Brain MRI and EEG were normal. His memory improved and returned to a normal baseline within 24 h from the onset. After the exclusion of potential causes and the patient returned to a normal state of memory, the diagnosis of transient global amnesia was made. At the follow‐up visit, the patient was in a state of normal function without a recurrence of memory impairment. Here, we presented this interesting case of transient global amnesia. TGA is a diagnosis of exclusion and is essential to keep in mind when evaluating a patient with acute onset of short‐term memory impairment, especially when etiological investigations reveal no potential cause.",

      "abstract": "Patients affected by the outcomes of serious traumatic and/or non-traumatic brain injury may show progressive recovery characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical conditions, which are often not completely different, but of differing seriousness. The unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) are syndromes that may characterize progression from the coma state and may be temporary clinical conditions, or in some cases, the final outcome of acute brain injury. The eventual recovery of consciousness is a dynamic process, in constant progress following the acute event. It is undeniable, however, that depending on various clinical (including non-neurological) determinants, positive progress can be strongly affected. While it remains true that the longer the UWS lasts, the less likely the patient is to recover from it, observations of \"late recovery\" are becoming increasingly frequent in the literature. Accordingly, it is becoming increasingly important to identify those late clinical, non-neurological complications, in particular during the intensive rehabilitation period, that can potentially affect the outcome. The aim of this study is to investigate late recovery from the UWS and MCS in a group of patients admitted to a neurorehabilitation program and to identify prognostic factors that may affect recovery, including late recovery, from the UWS. A retrospective cohort analysis without parallel cohort took place between January 2005 and January 2010, and involved 309 patients with severe brain injury outcomes (with initial GCS scores ≤ 8). With regard to patients emerging from the UWS after 36 months, univariate analysis revealed male gender, young age, a shorter duration of consciousness disorder and the absence of epileptic seizures to be the most important clinical characteristics for transition from UWS to MCS. The other variables considered were not significant: etiology of the coma, CRS-R score upon admittance to the ICU, infection by multidrug-resistant bacteria, and episodes of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity.",

Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment.

Drug-induced psychosis is expected to resolve after a 30-day period of sobriety, however, individuals with this condition are more likely to develop severe drug addiction. Compared to primary psychosis, participants with drug-induced psychosis exhibit poorer family history of psychotic diseases, higher insight, fewer positive and negative symptoms, more depressive symptoms, and greater anxiety. Substance-induced psychosis is strongly associated with the emergence of bipolar illness or schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with an increased chance of developing schizophrenia at a younger age. Episodes of self-harm after substance-induced psychosis are strongly linked to an elevated likelihood of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effective treatment involves ruling out emergencies, investigating underlying causes, and addressing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Management includes dynamic assessment, intervention, and vigilant monitoring in cases of suicidal behaviour. Antipsychotics may be used for short term, with gradual discontinuation when a person is in a stable condition. Relapse prevention strategies, both medication and non-medication-based, are crucial in long-term management. Conversion rates to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be as high as one in three individuals, with cannabis users and those with early-onset substance abuse at the highest risk.Keywords: Drug-induced psychosispsychotic disordersbipolar disorderschizophreniarisk Authors' contributionAll authors participated in all stages of the review.Disclosure statementLB worked as a scientific consultant for Libbs and Jansen.

      "abstract": "Substance addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder. It is the manifestation of the long-term pharmacological actions of substances on the receptor mechanisms of the brain’s neural circuitry. There are different neurotransmitter systems (e.g. dopamine, GABA, opioids) and even appetite hormones, acting within this neural circuitry in addiction, but their collective roles in the disorder remain equivocal. Importantly, disturbances to these systems may also pre-date addiction, which leads people to initiate substance abuse (e.g. stress, reward sensitivity). People may also be at an increased risk of initiating substance abuse due to age (e.g. adolescence), where there is an imbalance in the maturation of neural circuits. The pharmacokinetics of addictive drugs also plays a significant role in their abuse potential. Addiction is a recurrent disorder that is difficult to cure. Treatments that possess efficacy in aiding people to remain abstinent and stabilize their lives are the best courses of treatment for addiction disorders.",

      "abstract": "The syndrome of delirium is one of the most common manifestations of acute illness or drug toxicity in older patients. Controversy surrounds the definition of delirium, because its manifestations are pleomorphic and its mechanisms poorly understood. The American Psychiatric Association, in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV), emphasizes four key features (Table 60.1). The first of these is disturbance of consciousness. Patients with delirium characteristically are less aware of their surroundings and have difficulty focusing, sustaining, or shifting attention. They become easily distracted and have difficulty following commands or maintaining a conversation. Accompanying delirium is an impairment of cognition and perception not attributable to prior or progressing dementia. This is manifested by memory problems, disorientation, misperceptions, hallucinations, and language problems (e.g., dysnomia, dysgraphia). The course of delirium is acute (defined as hours to days) and fluctuating (patients may be lucid during morning rounds yet combative or confused at night). Finally, delirium in an individual patient has one or more underlying medical etiologies.1 KeywordsFemoral Neck FractureNeuroleptic Malignant SyndromeAcute Confusional StateDelirious PatientElderly Medical PatientThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "abstract": "One of the reasons for the development or worsening of cognitive impairment (CI) may be the use of a number of drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, glucocorticosteroids, antitumor drugs and a number of others. The negative effect of drugs on cognitive functions is realized due to many pathophysiological mechanisms: disruption of hormonal regulation, decreased neuronal excitability, increased activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, decreased cerebral circulation, atrophic changes in the brain; many mechanisms have not been fully established. Risk factors for the development of drug-induced CIs are: old age or childhood, brain damage, chronic diseases, genetic factors, the patient's initial CI, polypharmacy, dose and duration of drug use, acute infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, dehydration, acute urinary retention, etc. To diagnose and differentially diagnose drug-induced CI, it is necessary to establish a connection between the start of taking a suspected drug-inducer and a decrease in cognitive functions. The first step in the treatment of drug-induced CI is the abolition of an inducer drug or a reduction in its dose, in cases where it is impossible to discontinue the drug and there is no replacement, special slow-release dosage forms can be considered. The main measures to prevent drug-induced CI include the use of drugs with the lowest risk of their development, assessment of drug interactions, and the use of modern scales to assess the risk of developing this side-effect (anticholinergic burden scale, etc.).",

Cette maladie chronique est caracterisee par des etats de tolerance, de manque et d'usage compulsif de drogues, malgre des consequences negatives certaines, ainsi que d'un risque de rechute a long terme.

This paper described the relationship between several medical agents (neuroleptics, anti-depressants, anti-anxietics, anti-convulsants, psychostimulants, and drugs other than CNS-effective agents) and those effect on sleep and sleep stages. In the medicated patients, medical drugs are mainly responsible for their insomnia. However, it is sometimes difficult to find these drugs. The pathological sleep (i.e., delirium) are often developed following the drug-induced insomnia. Medication against insomnia (i.e., benzodiazepines) often exacerbates the pathological sleep. Therefore, common types of insomnia, drug-induced insomnia and pathological sleep should carefully be discriminated. Drug-induced rhythm-disorders and drug-induced sleep apnea remain to be studied. Future studies may clarify the effects of several drugs on these two disorders.",

      "title": "Chronic dizziness and instability as adverse effects explained by drug-induced vestibulotoxicity.",
      "abstract": "Background Dizziness and imbalance are common symptoms which can cause an important impairment of the ability of the patients affected to perform their daily activities. Diseases affecting posterior labyrinth can explain these symptoms. Ototoxicity is a quite common etiology of simultaneous damage of both labyrinths. The aim of this study is to present and analyze a series of patients with chronic dizziness and imbalance induced by vestibulotoxic pharmaceuticals administration. Methods A prospective study in patients diagnosed by chronic imbalance due to drug-induced vestibulotoxicity was performed, along 12 years. The inclusion criteria were: a) vertigo or balance disorders absent before drug administration; b) appearance of dizziness or imbalance during or just after drug administration; c) persistent symptoms for at least three months; d) dysequilibrium confirmed by abnormal dynamic posturography, and/or e) labyrinthine lesion demonstrated by spontaneous or postheadshake nystagmus, saccades as response to Halmagyi test or hypofunction observed by nystagmographic recording of caloric tests. Results Eight patients were included. In all cases, toxic effect was observed only on posterior labyrinth while cochlear symptoms were absent. All patients complained of feeling of dizziness and unsteadiness. Drugs involved were antibiotics in 4 patients, anti-tuberculosis medicinal products in 2 patients, chemotherapeutic agents in 1 and tamoxifen in the last one. All patients had abnormal dynamic posturography, while caloric tests were normal in 2 and abnormal in 6 patients. A remarkable improvement of clinical status was achieved in 7 patients, while one subject, despite improving her symptoms, continued to have a serious imbalance at the end of follow-up period. Conclusions Dizziness and imbalance as vestibulotoxic effects induced by some drugs are symptoms, likely underdiagnosed, that limit the physical activity and cause a decrease in quality of life of the affected patients. Early detection of these symptoms might allow, in some cases, to replace the vestibulotoxic medication by less toxic or non-ototoxic drug. In those cases with serious diseases, it is not possible to avoid the use of certain drugs but physician might prescribe other compounds to prevent or reduce their ototoxic effect.

Whilst symptoms are not as numerous or severe as in major depressive disorder (MDD), morbidity associated with dysthymia can be serious owing to the long duration of the distressing syndrome. Consistently depressed mood can lead to impairment in workplace functioning, as well as compromised management of interpersonal, marital and familial relationships.

The rapid development of technical advances in the neurosciences has led to a better understanding of the molecular biology, neurotransmitter systems, and neural circuitry involved in mental illness and substance use disorders. The authors discuss the neurobiological interface between substance use disorders and other psychiatric disorders with an emphasis on emerging data concerning four psychiatric disorders that commonly co-occur with substance use disorders: depression/mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. Better understanding of the connection between substance use disorders and psychiatric disorders could have a profound effect on prevention and treatment.",

Gelegentlich können allerdings eine Hypoglykämie, Nebennierenrindeninsuffizienz, Hypo- und Hypernatriämie oder auch Hypokalzämie akute neurologisch-psychiatrische oder synkopale Zustandsbilder hervorrufen, die zunächst häufig verkannt werden. Diese Erkrankungen können durch unauffällige Befunde bei Basisuntersuchungen und \"Routinelabor\" bereits weitgehend ausgeschlossen werden.",

      "title": "Impact on Cognition of the Use of Antipsychotics",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYCognitive dysfunction is recognised as one of the more enduring deficits in schizophrenia. The syndrome is associated with impairment of the temporal and frontal regions of the brain that are concerned with cognitive function, as well as subcortical regions that are closely interconnected with them. Cognitive dysfunction may underpin some of the psychopathology of schizophrenia, as well as contribute to the patient's impaired social and vocational functioning. Cognitive deficits are relatively independent of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia, and are probably central and enduring features of the disorder. It must also be considered that cognitive disability may be rate-limiting to the schizophrenic patient's rehabilitation and impairs quality of life. Although there is a general consensus that neuroleptic drugs are able to improve thepsychopathology of schizophrenia, there is continued debate concerning their impact on cognitive function. Chronic treatment with classical neuroleptics has been reported to produce only minimal improvement in, and may actually impair, cognitive function in schizophrenia. In contrast, novel antipsychotics seem to cause less cognitive impairment than classical antipsychotic medication and may improve cognitive function. Whilst in the past research focused on the development of clinically effective antipsychotic drugs with a reduced propensity to cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), it is now being recognised that maintaining and enhancing cognitive function and improving quality of life should be the goal in the treatment of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Learning disorders (LD) are disorders interfering with academic performance or with daily living activities requiring reading, writing, or mathematical abilities in subjects with a normal intelligence quotient. The prevalence of LD in the general population has been found to be 2–10% and reading disorders are the most frequent subtype. Epilepsy is one of the commonest neurological disorders in childhood with an estimated prevalence in 4–5/1,000. Epilepsy is considered to be idiopathic or cryptogenic in approximately two‐thirds of cases. LD are more common in people with epilepsy than in the general population: about 25% of patients with epilepsy are said to have LD. Various psychosocial, medication‐related, and epilepsy‐related factors may be associated with LD in epilepsy. LD can be either permanent or state‐dependent. Permanent LD are caused by a brain lesion and/or a stable brain dysfunction. In contrast, state‐dependent LD are potentially reversible and treatable; they are caused by epilepsy‐related factors. If allowed to persist for a long period, a state‐dependent LD may become permanent.",

Outcome was more benign than in schizophrenia, with most patients having a brief duration of psychosis and good response to small doses of neuroleptics. One-fourth of patients suffered a single, brief psychotic episode with return to full premorbid function. None required maintenance neuroleptic treatment. The outcome and descriptive profile of the disorder also differed from late-onset schizophrenia. Thus, Psychosis due to a General Medical (Neurological) Condition does appear to have predictive validity. However, no temporal association was found between the neurological illness and psychosis.

En este artículo se describen las indicaciones y se dan pautas para la deprescripción de potenciadores cognitivos (inhibidores de acetilcolinesterasa y memantina) y psicofármacos en pacientes con demencia. Materiales y métodos: esta es una revisión narrativa a partir del estado del arte sobre la deprescripción en el anciano con demencia. Resultados: la deprescripción no significa limitar esfuerzos terapéuticos, por el contrario, consiste en una estrategia de prevención cuaternaria para reducir el riesgo de reacciones adversas e identificar escenarios donde el beneficio clínico es marginal. Para esto, es necesario rastrear activamente a pacientes con demencia con indicación de deprescripción (falta de respuesta clínica adecuada, desaparición del beneficio con el uso prolongado, estadio de demencia grave o fase terminal). Discusión: los procesos de deprescripción varían según el grupo farmacológico e incluyen disminuciones progresivas de la medicación, así como el seguimiento y la monitorización para evitar el empeoramiento clínico. Se requiere de programas de educación médica en deprescripción para estudiantes y profesionales en ejercicio, especialmente en servicios de atención primaria en áreas rurales o dispersas, lo cual configura un llamado urgente a la neurología, la psiquiatría y la geriatría. Conclusión: el proceso de deprescripción en el paciente con demencia puede implementarse bajo criterios específicos y de una forma organizada.",

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Structural Aspects of Ischemic Brain Damage",
      "abstract": "The structural changes during cerebal ischemia are reviewed. In the acute phase the neurons may show either pale or dark type of ischemic injury. The former is usually associated with complete ischemia and the structural alterations are fairly inconspicious, while the latter is seen in incomplete ischemia or ischemia with recirculation and is characterized by shrinkage of neurons with extensive mitochondrial swelling and astrocytic edema. Both types of injury may be irreversible, but long post-ischemic period is usually necessary to see the final outcome of the insult, all the more since the neurons may not die until after a free postischemic interval (even with resumed function) of several hours to days. The delayed death is preceded by peculiar proliferation of cytoplasmic membranes before the doomed neurons become shrunken and disintegrate. This \"maturation phenomenon\" or \"delayed neuronal death\" is understandably important since it suggests that a longer postischemic interval for therapeutic interventions may exist. Several factors both during and after the ischemic insult can modify the changes and affect the severity of the damager Among the most important ones are the degree of lactic acidosis during the ischemic period, as well as the characteristics of the neurons, since excitoxic damage by transmitter substances released by the ischemic insult has been suggested to be responsible for the delayed neuronal death.",

One of the difficulties in studying delirium is that symptoms tend to fluctuate over the course of the day. Pre-existing organic brain disease appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of delirium, and numerous studies have shown a high rate of delirium in patients with cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The cognitive deficits associated with delirium have not been widely studied in a systematic, quantitative fashion. Following resolution of the frank delirium, documented cognitive deficits can be observed, and may persist in a diluted form for a period of months. Residual cognitive deficits may be due to a minimal and persistent confusion or to an underlying brain disorder.",

During the past twenty years, we have witnessed growing public and professional interest in dementia, its diagnosis and causes. This has led to the introduction of better methods of detection of cognitive impairment, coupled with early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and, to a lesser degree, of other forms of dementia. However, if the clinical presentation of patients does not follow the typical pattern of progressive memory loss starting in later life, then currently available diagnostic methods are less likely to be useful and patients with dementia may go unidentified for prolonged periods of time. Some of the less frequent causes of dementia may initially present with psychological or behavioral disturbances, others are associated with prominent neurological signs and symptoms. Patients may also present with marked deficits in cognitive domains other than memory, such as impaired language, which makes the diagnostic workup more difficult and onerous.",

Not infrequently, older adults experience minor impairment in memory, speed of cognitive processing, sleep, vision and hearing, vibratory sense in the lower extremities, and gait and posture. In general, these changes correspond with age-associated neuroanatomic changes (eg, diminished brain weight), but there is wide variability in the extent to which these changes occur.

      "title": "Mitochondrial DNA-Associated Leigh Syndrome and NARP",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP (neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa) are part of a continuum of progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormalities of mitochondrial energy generation. Leigh syndrome (or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is characterized by onset of symptoms typically between ages three and 12 months, often following a viral infection. Decompensation (often with elevated lactate levels in blood and/or CSF) during an intercurrent illness is typically associated with psychomotor retardation or regression. Neurologic features include hypotonia, spasticity, movement disorders (including chorea), cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Extraneurologic manifestations may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. About 50% of affected individuals die by age three years, most often as a result of respiratory or cardiac failure. NARP is characterized by proximal neurogenic muscle weakness with sensory neuropathy, ataxia, and pigmentary retinopathy. Onset of symptoms, particularly ataxia and learning difficulties, is often in early childhood. Individuals with NARP can be relatively stable for many years, but may suffer episodic deterioration, often in association with viral illnesses. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome is established clinically in a proband with progressive neurologic disease with motor and intellectual developmental delay, signs and symptoms of brain stem and/or basal ganglia disease, raised lactate concentration in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid, and any one of the following: Characteristic features on brain imaging Typical neuropathologic changes Typical neuropathology in a similarly affected sib Identification of a pathogenic variant in one of the 14 mitochondrial genes known to be involved in mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome confirms the diagnosis. The diagnosis of NARP is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and identification of a heteroplasmic pathogenic variant in one of the three mitochondrial genes known to be involved in NARP. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive treatment includes use of sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate for acute exacerbations of acidosis and anti-seizure medication for seizures. Dystonia is treated with benzhexol, baclofen, tetrabenazine, and gabapentin alone or in combination, or by injections of botulinum toxin. Anticongestive therapy may be required for cardiomyopathy. Regular nutritional assessment of daily caloric intake and adequacy of diet and psychological support for the affected individual and family are essential. Surveillance: Neurologic, ophthalmologic, and cardiologic evaluations at regular intervals to monitor progression and appearance of new symptoms. Care is frequently coordinated by a biochemical geneticist in North America, and by a metabolic physician/pediatrician elsewhere in the world. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sodium valproate and barbiturates, anesthesia, and dichloroacetate. Genetic counseling Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP are transmitted by maternal inheritance. The father of a proband is not at risk of having the mtDNA pathogenic variant. The mother of a proband usually has the mtDNA pathogenic variant and may or may not have symptoms. In most cases, the mother has a much lower proportion of abnormal mtDNA than the proband and usually remains asymptomatic or develops only mild symptoms. Occasionally the mother has a substantial proportion of abnormal mtDNA and develops severe symptoms in adulthood. Offspring of males with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are not at risk; all offspring of females with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are at risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. The risk to offspring of a female proband of developing symptoms depends on the tissue distribution and proportion of abnormal mtDNA. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for couples at increased risk of having children with mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome or NARP are possible by analysis of mtDNA extracted from non-cultured fetal cells or from single blastomeres, respectively. However, long-term outcome cannot be reliably predicted on the basis of molecular genetic test results.",

Some symptoms are clustered into syndromes, and provisional operational criteria, such as AD-related psychosis or depression, are proposed to facilitate their study.4,5 These symptoms have serious negative consequences for patients, including compromising quality of life and increasing impairment in activities of daily living. They are also major sources of psychological stress, depression, and burden for the caregivers.6 Studies have shown that these symptoms are linked to elder abuse and are important determinants of the institutionalization of patients with AD.7,8 Neuropsychiatric symptoms reflect the underlying neurobiological changes of the diseased brain, and many can be alleviated by psychotropic medications.9,10 Certain stage-specific patterns of the neuropsychiatric symptoms can be observed during the course of AD,11 and some symptoms may have specific value in the prediction of the disease course. For example, several studies have found that depression is a harbinger of AD;12,13 others have shown that delusions or hallucinations predict clinical or functional decline.14,15Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes cognitive impairment in the elderly not of sufficient severity to meet diagnostic criteria for dementia. It is often a transitional state between normal aging and dementia. Subjects with MCI have memory impairment or other cognitive deficits that may be noticeable to their family. Objective cognitive tests show worse performance than their age-and education-comparable contemporaries. However, their daily function is generally preserved.",

For a variety of clinical and methodological reasons, this remains an area that begs for new investigation. At the very least, these depressive symptoms should be viewed as a cause of significant and treatable \"excess disability\" (Kramer and Reifler, 1992). Demented patients with clinically significant depression (e.g., depressed mood, significant loss of appetite, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and agitation) should be considered for a trial of antidepressant therapy, even when they fail to meet full diagnostic criteria for major depression. These symptoms will, in most instances, respond to antidepressant therapy. The \"rules\" for treatment of depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) pay attention to cognitive toxicity of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms do not persist as long as in cognitively intact patients. Current treatments, especially those SSRI's like fluoxetine and sertraline that have cognitive enhancing effects, should be considered the \"first line\" antidepressants. We need to emphasize early detection and treatment of depressive symptoms in dementia in all arenas.",

      "title": "From Precipitation to Inhibition of Seizures: Rationale of a Therapeutic Paradigm",
      "abstract": "Epileptic seizures can be triggered by both nonspecific facilitating factors such as sleep withdrawal, fever, or excessive alcohol intake, and specific reflex epileptic mechanisms. These consist of sensory or cognitive inputs activating circumscribed cortical areas or functional anatomic systems that, due to some functional instability, respond with an epileptic discharge. Interruption of seizure activity at the stage of the aura (i.e., locally restricted discharge) also can be achieved by nonspecific (e.g., relaxation or concentration techniques or vagal nerve stimulation) or by specific focus-targeted sensory or cognitive inputs. The latter, again, activate circumscribed cortical areas. Intriguingly, in some patients, the same stimulus can either precipitate or abort a seizure. The response depends on the state of cortical activation: seizure precipitation occurs in the resting condition, and seizure interruption occurs when the epileptic discharge has begun close to the activated area. These relations can be understood on the background of experimental data showing that an intermediate state of neuronal activation is a precondition for the generation of paroxysmal depolarization shifts, whereas a hyperpolarized neuron will remain subthreshold, and a depolarized neuron that already produces action potentials is not recruitable for other activity. Sensory input meeting an intermediately activated pool of potentially epileptic neurons is adequate to produce a seizure. In another condition, the same stimulus can depolarize a neuron pool in the same area sufficiently to block the further propagation of nearby epileptic activity. Understanding these interactions facilitates the development of successful nonpharmaceutical therapeutic interventions for epilepsy.",

      "title": "Generalized Versus Selective Cognitive Impairments Resulting from Brain Damage Sustained in Childhood",
      "abstract": "Children who have sustained focal brain damage frequently have learning problems. It is difficult to determine whether the learning problems are selective, in that they affect only certain domains of cognitive function, or generalized and consistent with restricted intellectual ability. To distinguish between the two types of outcome, the consequences of early damage to the hippocampus and its effects on memory are contrasted with the effects of early hemispheric damage and surgery on speech and language function. That global amnesia results from bilateral damage to the medial temporal lobe in adults has been known for nearly 50 years 1. Until recently, however, there were no reports of a similar syndrome resulting from medial temporal pathology incurred in infancy. The earliest injuries that had been reported to produce such an effect were those that occurred at ages 8–10 years 2-4. The absence of cases with injuries earlier than this had led to two possible explanations: (a) damage to the medial temporal lobes very early in life results not in selective memory impairment but in mental retardation because of the widespread effects of such early damage on the development of cognition; or (b) the functional effects of early medial temporal pathology are only transient because of the special plasticity and impressive reorganizational capacity of the immature brain. Both of these explanations have now been challenged by the discovery of several young patients who, in association with hypoxic–ischaemic episodes incurred perinatally or during early childhood, showed severe bilateral hippocampal pathology verified by magnetic resonance imaging, and marked impairments in recall and episodic memory (i.e., memory for everyday events), in the presence of relatively preserved recognition and semantic memory (i.e., memory for factual information) 5, 6. The spared abilities were sufficiently developed to enable these children to attend mainstream schools and to acquire average levels of intelligence, language, and literacy skills. Conversely, the memory impairments, evident on such everyday tasks as remembering routes, appointments, messages, and so on, were sufficiently severe and chronic to preclude independence later in life. To distinguish this unusual pattern of memory function from that commonly seen in adult-onset amnesia, the syndrome has been labeled “developmental amnesia”(Fig.1)6. A: Severely impaired performance of five patients with developmental amnesia of perinatal origin on a test of episodic memory, the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test. B: Normal performance of these same five patients on verbal IQ subtests assessing semantic memory. Interestingly, the memory problems of patients with developmental amnesia of perinatal origin typically become manifest many years after their original insult, as they grow older and are required to become responsible and look after their schedules, belongings, and homework. Furthermore, the patients with pathology of perinatal origin show as great an impairment in recall and in episodic memory as do the patients with onset of damage in middle childhood, suggesting that the increased plasticity associated with a very early age at damage does not overcome the adverse consequences of selective hippocampal pathology on cognitive memory 7. Diagnosis of such selective memory problems early in life is now of critical importance, both to provide the affected children with appropriate remedial help in school and in daily life, and to protect against the adverse socioemotional consequences that memory impairment can impose on the developing child and adult alike. Unlike patients with developmental amnesia who develop low average to average intelligence, language, and literacy skills in the presence of bilateral hippocampal pathology, the majority of patients with focal hemispheric damage leading to hemispherectomy in childhood show a generalized pattern of cognitive impairment, primarily manifested as a dramatic loss of intellectual ability 8. This restriction affects both verbal and nonverbal functions 8, 9. In rare cases where a discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal abilities does occur, it almost always favours verbal intelligence, suggesting that verbal functions tend to be rescued and nonverbal functions crowded out as a consequence of early hemispheric damage 9, 10. Against the background of restricted intellectual abilities, levels of language comprehension and expression, reading, spelling, and numeracy are usually in line with expectations derived from the full-scale IQ. This generalized impairment in all aspects of cognitive ability resulting from early pathology is independent of hemispheric side of removal, as outlined below 8. Left hemisphere damage sustained during early childhood, particularly before the age of 4 or 5 years, rarely produces long-lasting aphasia 11-13, provided the homologous areas on the right remain functional. Extensive left hemisphere damage sustained congenitally or perinatally (i.e., before the onset of speech) has not been reported to result in aphasia or even dysphasia, although there may be delays in the development of speech and language. Later in childhood, subtle deficits in the production and comprehension of higher-order aspects of language emerge, but these appear to reflect not difficulties in language, per se, rather the limits set by a general reduction of intellectual abilities after hemispheric dysfunction and removal. With extensive left hemisphere injury acquired before the age of 4 or 5 years but after the onset of speech, aphasic symptoms may result initially, but the symptoms generally resolve before hemispherectomy. Furthermore, there is usually postmorbid development of speech to a point where, as in the patients with congenital or perinatal injury, there is no longer a selective dysphasia 14, 15. Indeed, language production in these patients may actually exceed comprehension ability, which again tends to decline together with the pathology-induced reductions in overall intellectual capacity. When extensive left hemisphere pathology is acquired after the age of 5 or 6 years, a mild version of the adult pattern of aphasia typically emerges. In such cases, speech arrest, transient mutism, anomia, and/or agrammaticism are seen, and these symptoms may become chronic 16-18. Even then, however, speech tends to be a resilient function, with the patient able to communicate effectively through short phrases and sentences. Numerous reports have indicated that, except for temporary interference with speech and language at the onset of a right hemisphere seizure disorder, neither extensive pathology nor removal of this hemisphere impairs linguistic functions selectively 11, 19, 20. Unlike linguistic outcome after left hemispherectomy, outcome after right hemispherectomy appears to be less dependent on the age at initial pathology, there being no reports in the literature of chronic dysphasic symptoms after right hemisphere pathology incurred at any age. Thus, with right hemisphere damage acquired late in childhood, just as with such pathology acquired in adulthood, speech and language functions appear to be unaffected even at the outset of the disorder. With right-sided pathology acquired early but after the onset of speech, there may be some initial linguistic disturbances (e.g., slurring, disorganized, or irrelevant speech) associated presumably with interhemispheric spread of epileptic activity, but these effects ordinarily resolve after hemispherectomy and arrest of seizures. Finally, right-sided, like left-sided pathology of congenital/perinatal onset may result in delayed development of speech and language, but there are no selective deficits. Rather, as with pathology leading to removal of the left hemisphere, damage and subsequent removal on the right at any age has an indirect effect on linguistic function that is related to the lowering of intelligence 8, 15. Because patients with either early-acquired or late-acquired pathology leading to left or right hemispherectomy have had acute-onset seizures, it is often difficult to disentangle the effects of seizures, per se, from those of the underlying pathology. The same confounding factor exists in most patients with congenital/perinatal pathology, because such pathology is commonly accompanied by early-onset seizures. There are exceptions, however, and these add support to existing evidence 21 that the seizures, or the associated anticonvulsant treatments, are particularly deleterious to both linguistic and intellectual development. When both the initial pathology and its related seizure disorder commence early in life, then intellectual and, as a consequence, linguistic outcome can be extremely poor. In such cases of early-onset, drug-resistant seizures, the prospects for a favourable intellectual and linguistic outcome are greatly improved by early hemispherectomy, presumably because it minimizes the chance that seizures will further damage or produce chronic dysfunction in the remaining hemisphere, particularly during early development. Late onset of protracted seizures is less deleterious for intellectual ability than early onset, however. For example, patients with middle- to late-childhood onset of epilepsy associated with Rasmussen's encephalitis 22 have better preserved nonverbal intellectual ability in the presence of selective linguistic and verbal intellectual impairments than do those with early-onset seizures 8, 18. This brief overview of the effects of neuropathology on the development of memory and speech and language functions indicates that there are definite limits to rescuing of cognitive functions in the face of early brain damage. Thus, in the domain of cognitive memory, episodic memory is selectively impaired after bilateral hippocampal pathology, even when this pathology is sustained perinatally. In the domain of language function, there is evidence of rescuing of speech and basic communication abilities, but this is often achieved at the cost of nonverbal cognitive functions being “crowded out.” More importantly, early unilateral brain damage leading to hemispherectomy places a heavy cost on intellectual ability, and thus sets limits on the ultimate development of all aspects of cognitive function.",

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

They are not effective in reversing an intravenously administered anesthetic or in depressions due to physical agents or an overdosage of a volatile anesthetic or a stimulating drug.Antinarcotics are weak narcotics rather than stimulants. They exert an antagonistic action only in the presence of an over-dosage of a narcotic; they are not effective if the depression is due to excess use of either barbiturates or other non-narcotic hypnotics.Management of a comatose patient includes establishing an airway, administering oxygen, giving the drug indicated by the type of depression, hydrating the patient, and maintaining the correct fluid-electrolyte balance.",

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

Despite its clear association with multiple common risk factors and important outcomes, including mortality and long-term cognitive impairment, both the ultimate causes of and ideal treatments for delirium remain unclear. Studies suggest that neuroinflammation, hypoxia, alterations in energy metabolism, and imbalances in multiple neurotransmitter pathways contribute to delirium, but commonly used treatments (e.g., antipsychotic medications) target only one or a few of these potential mechanisms and are not supported by evidence of efficacy. At this time, the optimal treatment for delirium during critical illness remains avoidance of risk factors, though ongoing trials may expand on the promise shown by agents such as melatonin and dexmedetomidine.",

These deficits extend across a wide variety of neuropsychological domains and can be observed over a period of months following detoxification. Furthermore, they are seen in both male and female alcoholics, despite the fact that female alcoholics often have shorter drinking histories. Although these deficits are widely observed, there is considerable heterogeneity both within and across studies. Currently, the sources of this variability are only poorly understood. In this article, we review these neurocognitive and neurophysiological deficits, their pattern of recovery, potential contributing or confounding factors, and some of the clinical implications of these findings.",

      "title": "PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS, STRESS, AND THE EGO",
      "abstract": "Making the differential diagnosis of a psychosis associated with psychedelic drugs is a difficult and confusing, but very important, clinical problem. Understanding the interaction between the drug effect, the current stress on the individual, and his characteristic level of ego function not only makes differential diagnosis possible, but has ramifications for treatment and prognosis. This interaction can best be understood by clarifying a number of different factors including the extent of drug use, past personal history, prepsychotic level of functioning, mode of onset of the psychosis, nature of external precipitating factors, and presenting mental status. Three different clinical entities can be found when this is done, each of which presented a psychotic appearance, and in each of which past drug use was involved. These are: 1) An acute response to a drug effect, in which the weakened ego of a borderline individual is overwhelmed and not able to reintegrate when the drug effect wanes. This individual responds well to short term hospitalization with supportive treatment. 2) A gradual shift toward projection, denial and then delusions, and withdrawal even in relatively healthy individuals who take drugs very frequently at a time of a life crisis. The development of alloplastic ego defenses is to avoid a dealing with painful affect, and hospitalization or any treatment which would require confronting this was unsuccessful and just reinforces the new defense structure. 3) Occasional drug use in a schizophrenic may well have no effect on that individual's overall clinical course or response to any mode of treatment. Why the drug experience, a transient stress of ego function, does not have long range consequences is not known, but may be because the ego has learned to adapt to these transient episodes, which are much less threatening than actual events in the individual's life. Three patients were presented who demonstrated these three clinical conditions and their different responses to treatment were noted.",

      "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by dream-enacting behavior and loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep. Idiopathic RBD occurs in the absence of any neurological disease or other possible cause, is male-predominant and its clinical course is generally chronic progressive. Secondary RBD may be related to neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. Recent long-term prospective studies have shown that 30% to 65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disorder with the rate of emergence depending on the length of the follow-up period. RBD may therefore be one of the earliest signs of and/or a long-term predictor for neurodegenerative disorders. Because RBD antecedes the development of these disorders by several years or decades, its recognition may enable the delay or prevention of neurodegenerative disorders through the early application of neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapies in the future.",

The same drugs can cause both psychomotor excitement or psychic slowness. In a few instances psychotic syndromes can be observed.

The prevalence of delirium in elderly patients admitting to hospital is 5-55% [1]. Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome that may occur in several different settings and one of them is vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes many cerebral cortex abnormalities such as confusion, mood and memory changes, delirium with or without hallucinations, depression and acute psychotic states [2,3]. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) describes the spectrum of potentially reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities seen in patients with liver dysfunction after exclusion of unrelated neurologic and/or metabolic abnormalities. The clinical manifestations of HE is characterized by cognitive and motor deficits of varying severity without specific lesions in the central nervous system. The symptoms range from minimal changes in personality to coma, including delirium [4]. Usually, in the elderly patients with cirrhosis, it is hard to differentiate two clinical situations. Here we report a case of an elderly patient with cirrhosis who experienced delirium due to vitamin B12 deficiency, but was treated as HE before.",

La amnesia del desarrollo se ha asociado a la afectacion bilateral del hipocampo, evidente en algunos casos en la resonancia magnetica en forma de alteracion de la senal y signos de atrofia, o bien disminucion del tamano del hipocampo en estudios volumetricos cerebrales. Pacientes y metodos. Se presentan seis observaciones de amnesia del desarrollo, su cuadro clinico, exploracion neuropsicologica y hallazgos de neuroimagen. Resultados. Todos ellos muestran una alteracion de la memoria episodica con preservacion de la memoria semantica. Presentan una inteligencia general normal y siguen una escolarizacion ordinaria con necesidades educativas especiales. Conclusiones. Es necesario tener presente esta entidad en el seguimiento de los recien nacidos de riesgo por sus antecedentes perinatales e incluir la exploracion de la memoria en el estudio neuropsicologico de estos sujetos. Por otra parte, se senala la especificidad del cuadro clinico y del perfil neuropsicologico para el diagnostico de la amnesia del desarrollo aun en ausencia de lesiones del hipocampo en la resonancia magnetica convencional.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus(SE)is defined as a prolonged seizure and is a common neurological emergency with high morbidity and mortality rates. As uncontrolled SE causes irreversible neurological damage, prompt diagnosis and treatment are required. If anti-seizure medications and benzodiazepines, which are initial treatments for SE, are not effective and SE deteriorates to refractory, anesthetic drugs are needed to suppress seizure activity under electroencephalogram(EEG)monitoring. Continuous EEG monitoring is useful not only for evaluating the control of SE but also for diagnosing non-convulsive SE(NCSE)and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. New-onset refractory status epilepticus is defined as refractory SE in a patient without active epilepsy and without a clear acute or active structural, toxic, or metabolic cause. Because autoimmune encephalitis is the most frequently identified cause, immunotherapy can be attempted in addition to antiepileptic treatment within 2 weeks. Although NCSE is the major cause of unconsciousness, diagnosis is difficult because of uncertain clinical symptoms. Continuous EEG monitoring over 24 h is crucial for diagnosis, although arterial spin labeling-magnetic resonance imaging is alternatively useful. Finally, the building of a multidisciplinary cooperation system is required for prompt diagnosis and intensive treatment for controlling SE.",

      "abstract": "Electrophysiologic testing plays an important role in evaluating peripheral nerve, muscle, and neuromuscular junction diseases, aiding in diagnosis and treatment strategies by offering real-time assessment. Demyelination of peripheral nerves results in increased conduction delay, temporal dispersion, conduction block, and stimulation threshold. The localization or diffusion of these changes is crucial in understanding disease pathogenesis, necessitating stimulation at multiple points along nerve pathways. When axonal degeneration occurs, the amplitude is reduced, with mild conduction delay. Acute axonal degeneration may require 1 week to develop into Wallerian degeneration. During this time, conductivity was preserved in the nerve peripheral to the lesion. When MG or LEMS is suspected, repetitive nerve stimulation tests and single-fiber EMG are valuable for the diagnosis and pathophysiological evaluation. Notably, the latter is highly sensitive but not specific. Needle electromyography (EMG) assists in differentiating between myopathies and neurogenic diseases, and in determining whether the patient is in an acute or chronic stage. Integration of these tests contribute to an accurate diagnosis when considering the presenting symptoms.",

      "title": "Review: Psychiatric Disorder and Cognitive Impairment in SLE",
      "abstract": "Poor performance on cognitive testing is common in SLE but it is not progressive in the majority of patients and may fluctuate or resolve without specific treatment. Cognitive impairment in patients without overt CNS-SLE may result from generalised disease activity or psychiatric disorder which reduce speed, concentration and motivation. This emphasises once again the importance of recognising and treating psychiatric disorder in these patients. Although mean cognitive scores are lower in SLE patients with overt CNS involvement than those without, an individual's cognitive score is a poor predictor of the presence of CNS involvement because of considerable overlap between groups. It has been suggested that the pattern of cognitive impairment, rather than simply whether it is present or absent, may be more helpful in identifying patients with CNS involvement but this requires further investigation in prospective studies. Cognitive impairment at one point in time is not predictive of future CNS events during 1 or 2 years of follow-up. Routine cognitive testing in SLE does not therefore appear to be helpful either for identifying patients with current CNS involvement or for identifying those at future risk of this complication. In the absence of double-blind randomised controlled trials, treatment of neuropsychiatric SLE is based on clinical experience and anecdotal case reports. Aggressive immunosuppression with high-dose corticosteroids in conjunction with either azathioprine or cyclophosphamide may be indicated in patients with life-threatening CNS-SLE but, on the basis of current evidence, is not justified in those with lone subtle cognitive abnormalities.",

A significant proportion is related to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, either diffuse or focal (e.g., stroke). Neonatal brain injury is recognized clinically by a characteristic encephalopathy that evolves over days in the newborn period. This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births. More than 95% of infants with neonatal stroke survive to adulthood, and many have some form of motor or cognitive disability.",

      "abstract": "Critical care physicians often find themselves prognosticating for their patients, attempting to predict patient survival as well as disability. In the case of neurologic injury, this can be especially difficult. A frequent cause of coma in the intensive care unit is resuscitation following cardiac arrest, for which mortality and severe neurologic disability remain high. Recent studies of the clinical examination, of serum markers such as neuron-specific enolase, and of somatosensory evoked potentials allow accurate and specific prediction of which comatose patients are likely to suffer a poor outcome. Using these tools, practitioners can confidently educate the family for the majority of patients who will die or remain comatose at 1 month. Delirium is a less dramatic form of neurologic injury but, when sought, is strikingly prevalent. In addition, delirium in the intensive care unit is associated with increased mortality and poorer functional recovery, prompting investigation into preventative and therapeutic strategies to counter delirium. Finally, neurologic damage may persist long after the patient's recovery from critical illness, as is the case for cognitive dysfunction detected months and years after critical illness. Psychiatric impairment including depression or post-traumatic stress disorder may also arise. Mechanisms contributing to each of these entities are reviewed.",

Withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia (WE-D), a less recognized subtype of TD, can manifest shortly after abrupt cessation of antipsychotic use regardless of the neuroleptic subclass used. Super sensitivity psychosis is another possible symptom of acute withdrawal from neuroleptics that can occur alone or concomitant with WE-D. Because of their ever increasing off-label indications and attenuated extrapyramidal side effect profiles, atypical antipsychotics are becoming ubiquitous in both inpatient and outpatient settings, reflecting their utility. However, it is likely that this trend will also result in a greater prevalence of WE-D and super sensitivity psychosis. Clinicians without expertise in the utilization of neuroleptics are likely to misattribute withdrawal symptoms precipitated by abrupt cessation of antipsychotics with toxicity to these agents and erroneously withhold or delay their reinitiation, thereby exacerbating symptoms and inadvertently prolonging patient distress. This case report will illustrate the unique and perplexing presentation of WE-D and super sensitivity psychosis in an acute setting, and provide an effective diagnostic and treatment approach to resolving these conditions.",

It is the most frequent reason for referring children to mental health services. Core symptoms of AD/HD (inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) present behaviors that parents may rate in standardized questionnaires (e.g., does not study, memory problems, cannot concentrate, cannot stay still, has no motives, etc.), are also present in other developmental or psychiatric disorders (e.g., specific learning difficulties, sensory modulation disorder, mood or anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders). This may cause errors in the differential diagnosis if clinicians do not add objective measures of cognitive deficits associated with each disorder. AD/HD presents neuropsychological deficits (compared to non-clinical populations) that are also present in other disorders, like deficient working memory, whereas other neuropsychological deficits are unique characteristics of AD/HD, such as sustained attention, response inhibition, and variability of response time. Likewise, anxiety disorders present neuropsychological deficits in autobiographical memory, mood disorders present neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and verbal memory. Neuropsychological tests such as the Continuous Performance Test, tests of reading phonetic decoding, and others, may improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis, differentiating AD/HD from other disorders, or revealing the comorbidity of AD/HD with other disorders.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a seizure lasting longer than 5 min, or at least two seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them. Early emergent medical management consists of life support and an etiology survey, and subsequent treatment can be classified into 4 stages: (1) early SE, (2) established SE, (3) refractory SE, and (4) super-refractory SE. For early SE, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, are the agents of choice, given to terminate the seizure activity rapidly. For established SE (20-30 min after SE onset), the therapeutic strategy is to give parental antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. At the stage of refractory SE (1-2 hours after SE onset), the conventional treatment is induction of general anesthesia using midazolam or propofol. Superrefractory SE is defined as SE that continues, or recurs, for at least 24 hours after the onset of anesthetic therapy. In addition to treatments used in established and refractory SE, other potentially effective therapies include ketamine, magnesium, inhalational anesthetics, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, induced hypothermia, and neurosurgery. The principle of SE therapy is rapid seizure control and correction of underlying problems. Future well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to establish the standard treatment, especially in settings of established, refractory, and super-refractory SE.",

      "abstract": "一、 药物滥用是一种慢性、复发性脑疾病。药物滥用将导致药物成瘾（addiction），其主要表现有药物依赖、药物耐受、药物敏感化以及药物停用后的戒断症状（withdraw symptom）。药物成瘾的核心特征是强迫性觅药和用药行为。药物成瘾会导致药物滥用者认知功能的损伤和认知偏差，并会造成滥用者情绪异常。药物成瘾是一个复杂的生物学过程，有着及其复杂的机理。对药物成瘾机制的解释有很多种，主要认为成瘾过程是一种学习记忆过程，学习记忆的机制在药物成瘾过程中起到了非常重要的作用。首先，学习记忆和药物成瘾过程都受到了相似的神经营养因子以及神经递质系统的调控，例如：它们都受cAMP，CREB等调控因子的调控。其次，研究发现与成瘾相关的线索，如用药有关的人物、地点或暗示等，在药物戒断很长时间后都会恢复吸毒者的用药行为。并且，当把与成瘾相关的线索呈现给毒品戒断中的人时，这些人会出现心率、呼吸加快，血压升高等现象，甚至表现出明显的渴求行为。药物对学习记忆的影响是复杂的，虽然重复使用药物会导致药物成瘾，并且这个过程需要学习记忆机制的参与，但同时使用吗啡却会对其他类型的学习记忆（如：恐惧性学习记忆、一次性被动回避学习记忆和水迷宫空间学习记忆）造成破坏。学习前给予吗啡可以剂量及状态依赖地破坏被动回避试验以及空间辨别试验的记忆获取过程。学习过程结束后立即给予吗啡可以破坏一次性被动回避试验、主动回避试验和恐惧条件化试验的记忆巩固过程。测试前给予吗啡可以破坏空间辨别试验的记忆提取过程。本研究的目的在于更进一步地了解使用吗啡导致吗啡成瘾以及使用吗啡导致学习记忆的各个阶段受损的机制。为此我们采用了药理学以及多种行为学的方法，1、用PTZ诱发的癫痫持续状态干扰吗啡成瘾的学习记忆过程，进一步比较了吗啡成瘾的学习记忆与其他学习记忆，例如：空间学习记忆以及食物奖赏学习记忆的机制有何异同；2、研究了β-肾上腺素系统与阿片系统在空间记忆巩固过程中的相互作用；3、我们还研究了NMDA受体的激动剂和拮抗剂在吗啡破坏空间记忆提取过程中的作用。研究结果发现： 1．戊四唑诱发的癫痫持续状态，对吗啡建立的条件化位置偏好没有任何影响，动物仍然对阳性箱（吗啡匹配箱）表现出明显的偏好。但是癫痫持续状态破坏了食物建立的条件化位置偏好，并且还破坏了水迷宫和Y迷宫检测的空间记忆。癫痫持续状态破坏了食物建立的条件化位置偏好，原因不是由于其影响了动物的食欲。此外，癫痫持续状态也没有持续地破坏动物的活动能力，因此，对动物活动量的影响也不是造成其他学习记忆破坏的原因。这些结果说明，吗啡成瘾的学习记忆和普通的学习记忆在机制上可能存在不同之处。为了说明这个问题，我们还需要进行其他更深入的研究。 2、训练后立即单独注射吗啡（0.25和2.5 mg/kg）或心得安（2，10和20 mg/kg）都不会破坏动物Y-迷宫空间记忆的巩固过程，动物仍然能识别新异环境，并在里面停留较长时间。但是，训练后同时注射吗啡和心得安却可以破坏动物空间记忆的巩固过程。并且，较高剂量的吗啡（2.5 mg/kg）加上较高剂量的心得安（10和20 mg/kg）对记忆的破坏更严重，实验组动物在新异环境停留的时间显著低于对照组。这说明阿片系统和去甲肾上腺素系统在破坏记忆巩固的过程中可能有协同作用。 3、记忆提取前30分钟注射吗啡（1和10 mg/kg）可以剂量依赖地破坏Y-迷宫空间记忆的提取。单独注射NMDA受体的激动剂NMDA（1，2和4 mg/kg）对动物的空间记忆提取没有影响，但是，单独注射NMDA受体拮抗剂MK-801（0.05，0.1和0.2 mg/kg）剂量依赖地破坏了空间记忆的提取。同时注射吗啡（10 mg/kg）和NMDA（2 mg/kg）可以阻断吗啡对空间记忆造成的破坏作用。相反，共同注射吗啡（1 mg/kg）和MK-801（0.05 mg/kg）可以加重吗啡对空间记忆造成的破坏作用。这说明谷氨酸系统可以干扰吗啡对记忆提取过程的影响。 二、衰老严重地影响了人们的视觉功能，然而眼睛光学系统的老年性改变并不能完全解释清楚这种视觉功能衰退。一般认为是神经系统的退化导致了这种老年性功能降低。但是，研究显示视网膜（retina）和外膝体（dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, dLGN）在衰老的过程中神经元的数量和体积以及神经元的功能特性，如对比度敏感性、空间分辨率等，都没有明显的变化，因此，人们推测老化导致的神经系统的变化发生在更高级的视觉皮层。过去几年的研究发现老年动物视觉皮层细胞发生了一系列反应特性的改变，如：老年动物皮层细胞的方向选择性和方位选择性降低以及细胞反应的潜伏期延长。这些细胞水平的变化被认为是老年性视觉功能衰退的神经机制。为了更全面地了解衰老过程对视觉皮层的影响以及细胞反应改变与整体功能降低之间的关系，本研究采用活体动物细胞外单位记录的方法，比较了青年和老年猕猴初级视觉皮层细胞时间反应特性和空间反应特性的差异。研究结果发现：老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的时间频率和空间频率敏感性明显比年轻动物降低。表现为老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的最优时间和空间频率、空间分辨率（spatial resolution, SR）和较高时间截至频率（high temporal frequency cut-off, TF50）都显著低于年轻动物初级视觉皮层细胞，同时伴随着这些功能的降低，老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的自发放增加，对视觉刺激的反应增加，但是信噪比却显著降低。这些结果表明，老年动物初级视觉皮层细胞的功能在老化过程中都普遍降低。这可能是导致老年人视觉功能降低的原因。",

      "abstract": "Prolongation or lifelong pharmacotherapy has emerged as the main therapeutic tool for preventing relapse in depression. However, outcome after discontinuation of antidepressants is unfavourably affected by the duration of their administration. Loss of clinical effects, despite adequate compliance, has also emerged as a vexing clinical problem. Use of intermittent pharmacotherapy with follow-up visits is another therapeutic option, that, however, entails the problems of resistance and of discontinuation syndromes. In recent years, several controlled trials have suggested that a sequential use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of the acute episode and psychotherapy in its residual phase may improve long-term outcome. Antidepressant drugs may be tapered and discontinued during the course of psychotherapy. The sequential treatment of depression not fall within the realm of maintenance strategies. It is an intensive, two-stage approach, which is based on the fact that one course of treatment with a specific tool (whether pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy) is unlikely to provide solution to the complex array of symptoms of patients with mood disorders.",

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs. Four of the most common epilepsies are: (1) grand mal — manifested by major convulsions, usually a sequence of tonic spasm of all body musculature followed by synchronous clonic jerking and prolonged post-seizure depression of all central functions; (2) petit mal — characterized by brief attacks of loss of consciousness usually accompanied by some clonic motor activity, sometimes with no motor activity, and sometimes with complete relaxation of all musculature; (3) psychomotor epilepsy — characterized by attacks of confused behavior with a wide variety of clinical manifestations; (4) focal cortical epilepsy in which there may be motor abnormalities including convulsions of single limbs or muscle groups or specific and localized sensory disturbances depending on the particular area of cortex producing the abnormal electrical activity.",

Deux grands types de plainte peuvent être opposés. La plainte suspecte de révéler une ma traduit un trouble de la mémorisation : les difficultés ne portent que sur le passé récent, elles retentissent rapidement sur la vie quotidienne et s’accompagnent de modifications du comportement qui amènent l’entourage à demander la consultation. Un examen rapide de la mémoire met en évidence un trouble du rappel qui n’est pas amélioré par les procédures de facilitation (indiçage). La plainte « bénigne » témoigne d’un trouble du rappel : elle porte aussi bien sur le passé ancien que récent, ne s’accompagne pas de modifications du comportement ou de diminution des activités de la vie quotidienne. La gêne est essentiellement subjective et le sujet vient seul consulter. L’examen montre une disparition des difficultés de rappel par l’indiçage.

      "abstract": "In critically ill patients, the central nervous system remains vulnerable to multiple insults including ischemia, hemorrhagic events, and encephalopathy. The peripheral nervous system is vulnerable in the setting of neuro-muscular blockade (NMB), related drug-drug interactions, and drug-clinical state interactions. Optimal assessment of the nervous system is done by means of the clinical neurological examination. In this manner, orientation, arousal, and responsiveness to stimulation provide feedback on focal and global stability of the central nervous system. Where clinical evaluation is compromised, such as with deep sedation and NMB, risk of undetected seizure activity, and/or progression of neurological injury increases dramatically. A patient receiving NMB risks breakthrough awareness and pain. Long-term complications of NMB including prolonged weakness or paralysis as well as post-traumatic stress dramatically increase morbidity and length of stay. Technologies such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and bispectral index (BIS trade mark ) monitoring are effective for assessing cerebral function as well as level of sedation or arousal, respectively, in patients with a compromised neurological assessment. Neuromuscular transmission (NMT) monitoring by means of peripheral nerve stimulation and assessment of the evoked response may be utilized, within the context of clinical assessment, to determine level of chemical paralysis and minimize dosing of NMB agents. This article explores utilization and differentiates technologies such as EEG, BIS, and NMT monitoring. Monitoring parameters are illustrated using a case study approach.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The withdrawal syndromes after discontinuance of alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedative drugs, such as chloral and paraldehyde, are all similar. The severity of a withdrawal reaction is largely determined by the daily dose, the duration of administration and the rate of fall of the drug levels after withdrawal, as well as the propensity of the individual patient. The time course of a withdrawal reaction is determined by the drug's clearance. Alcohol has a half‐life of a few hours; withdrawal symptoms may develop within 6–8 hours of abstinence and convulsions in 12–48 hours. After discontinuance of short‐ or medium‐acting barbiturates (half‐life 8–40 hours) symptoms may develop in 1–3 days, followed by convulsions and delirium after 3–8 days. Symptoms and seizures may develop in the 1–10 days after withdrawal of benezodiazepines. In patients with no prior history of epilepsy the types of seizures most commonly induced by drug withdrawal are generalized convulsions, but partial seizures are not uncommon if there is a focal cerebral lesion, or a previous history of partial seizures. Paroxysmal activity and photosensitivity may occur after barbiturate withdrawal in non‐epileptics, more commonly in severe withdrawal reactions. Similar EEG changes may be seen after alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, but photosensitivity does not appear to have been shown to be a feature of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.",

      "title": "Obstetric antecedents of cerebral palsy",
      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy has been defined as a group of non-progressive disorders of movement or posture due to a defect or lesion of the immature brain. 1 Cerebral palsy is defined by clinical description only; there is no definitive test. It is not informative about aetiolgy, pathology or prognosis. The definition of cerebral palsy also lacks precision in that neither the age at which the brain is mature nor the severity of the disorder required are specified. Brain development is most rapid in utero and early childhood but continues at a diminished rate throughout life. There is therefore no biological rationale for choosing any particular age to define brain maturity. The defining age below whcih cerebral palsy may be recognised therefore varies between centres for pragmatic reasons usually associated with assertainment. For example, in Western Australia the criterion is set at 5 years, 2 since by this age any central motor impairments of congenital or neonatal origin will be apparent and can usually be differentiated from progressive disorders or isolated motor delay. Thus the definition includes a group of children with post-neonatally acquired brain damage resulting in movement disorder. Post-neonatally acquired cerebral palsy differs from presumed congenital or perinatal cerebral palsy in that there is usually no doubt that it was caused by a specific post-neonatal event such as meningitis or head trauma. Although there is an excess of perinatal morbidity amoung children acquiring cerebral palsy post-neonatally, 3 suggesting a prior vulnerability in some cases, post neonatally acquired cerebral palsy will not be considred further in this review.",

Delirium can be provoked by medical conditions, or the use or withdrawal of drugs. Risk factors include older age and cognitive impairment. Delirium is associated with many complications, represents a significant emotional burden for the patient and caretakers, increases length of stay in the hospital, and causes higher health care costs. Non-pharmacological measurements can sometimes prevent delirium, and are essential for its treatment with proven effectiveness. Antipsychotics should be administered only as an exception, not as a rule. Antipsychotics may be of use when the patient puts himself or others in danger, or when he suffers substantially from hallucinations.",

Long-term impairments are often subtle and overlooked. They need to be objectively assessed using neuropsychological tests to be diagnosed. Although POCD has been the subject of considerable research over the past decades, it remains uncertain why some patients do not return to preoperative levels of cognitive function. Surgery and anesthesia have both been implicated to play a role in POCD development, and certain patient-related factors, such as advanced age and low preoperative baseline cognitive function, have consistently been found to predict postoperative cognitive decline. This article will present an overview of POCD and its etiology and provide advice on possible strategies on its prevention.",

You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event.

The pathway to the diagnosis of alcoholism may be considerably compromised in the often comorbid or multimorbid patient. To live up to an advanced age seems to be a good argument against chronic substance abuse. Elderly people and their relatives are often still more reluctant to report about socially stigmatizing disorders. On top of that, the amount of social control is reduced after the end of employment and upon entering retirement. Yet, if alcohol-withdrawal symptoms occur, e.g., following an admission of the addicted patient to a hospital, the missed diagnosis of alcoholism means a delay of the correct interpretation of such complications and of the necessary treatment. Aged patients with reduced physical and mental reserve capacity are at special risk of developing further serious complications. Progressive, sometimes irreversible decay of the cognitive functions in long lasting delirious states or, as an aftermath of withdrawal, epileptic seizures are of particular importance.",

      "abstract": "Since the introduction of neuroleptics in 1952, many studies have examined objective aspects of efficacy and tolerability. Despite the fact that neuroleptic treatment should also improve the patient's subjective experiences, this outcome criterion has been neglected in the past. This is unfortunate, as subjective well-being with treatment appears to be strongly related to patients' readiness to take their medication. The few existing studies differ in methodology and are difficult to compare due to a number of weaknesses, including varying underlying concepts, used assessment scales, or small sample sizes. Negative subjective well-being may manifest itself throughout the entire neuroleptic treatment, even as early as in the first 48 hours after neuroleptic treatment starts (initial dysphoric reaction, IDR). The aetiology of reduced subjective well-being or IDR is not fully explained; neuroleptic side effects, especially affective, cognitive and motor adverse events, differential effects of varying psychopathology or biopsychosocial are factors in discussion. The clinical impression is characterised by symptoms as dysphoria/anhedonia, reduced vitality, and emotional indifference, which could have a negative impact on relevant clinical factors such as response or medication adherence, and therefore on outcome. With regard to pharmacological treatment, evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotics induce less negative subjective effects than conventional neuroleptics, and that various new-generation antipsychotics could be evaluated differently by patients. This article reviews existing literature in order to approach relevant questions for pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychological impairment is prominent in patients with depression, but it is unclear whether deficits persist after clinical response. This study aimed to investigate neuropsychological functions in the course of the illness. Depressive patients were investigated in the acute state and after clinical response using an extensive neuropsychological test battery. After clinical response, there was only a partial improvement in learning and memory and there were no changes regarding working memory, executive functions, and attention. Transient impairments in visual learning and memory suggest a depression-related state effect. The continuing deficits in attention, working memory, and executive function might be considered a trait marker.",

      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A expectativa de vida da populacao idosa vem aumentado sensivelmente de forma mais acelerada que a de qualquer outra faixa etaria. Este fatopode estar relacionado, as acoes de saude publica, mudancas comportamentais, alem dos avancos nas pesquisas cientificas e recursos tecnologicos na area da saude. Com o avanco da idade, ocorre tambem a chegada de doencas cronicas nao transmissiveis, como a depressao. A depressao e uma sindrome de natureza multifatorial, que se caracteriza pela associacao de condicoes clinicas e psiquicas, tendo como principais sintomas o humor deprimido e o isolamento de forma gradual e continua. Na populacao idosa, a depressao associa-se ao proprio processo de envelhecimento (deficits fisicos e cognitivos relacionados a idade) e a comorbidades, uso continuado de alguns medicamentos, adversidades emocionais e mudancas de estilo de vida. Por outro lado, a depressao piora a comorbidade, diminuindo a qualidade de vida e aumentando a mortalidade. Esse trabalho tem como objetivo relatar a abordagem com um grupo de pessoas idosas sobre depressao na terceira idade. Desenvolvimento do trabalho: Relato de experiencia tendo como abordagem utilizada a roda de conversa. A acao educativa foi realizada comoito idosos, integrantes do grupo UnAPI (Universidade aberta a pessoa Idosa), da Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul.O grupo proporciona diversas atividades que priorizam a educacao em saude, alem da troca de conhecimento entre os idosos e discentes dos mais diversos cursos de graduacao da UFMS.A acao educativa foi realizada no dia 2 de agosto de 2017. Resultados: Foi iniciado com uma apresentacao e avaliacao do grau de conhecimento previo a respeito da depressao, posteriormente abordamos o mesmo tema , dando enfoque na epidemiologia da doenca, principais sinais e sintomas e tratamento.Notou-se a participacao constante dos integrantes no decorrer da atividade educativa, havendo uma boa integracao entre os mesmos, onde relataram suas vivencias pessoais e de conhecidos com depressao, demonstrando interesse nos esclarecimentos de duvidas quanto ao tema tratado. Consideracoes finais: Abordar temas emergentes de saude como a depressao, tem se mostrado de grande valia na conquista de autonomia em saude da populacao idosa. Os idosos participantes da acao apresentaram diversas duvidas e relataram suas experiencias acerca do tema, tal fato mostra que os mesmos nao estao alienados no que tange o assunto. Pode-se observar atraves desta acao, que as vivencias individuais e a maneira de como e realizado o enfrentamento dos problemas cotidianos interferem intrinsicamente na qualidade de vida e na prevencao da depressao na terceira idade. A abordagem do tema para com este publico se mostra necessaria e pertinente, servindo como medida terapeutica e educativa nos campos da saude mental.",

Although it was long believed that positive and disorganized symptoms of schizophrenia burned out over time and only negative or deficit symptoms would be detected in late life, several recent studies have suggested that this conception is not fully accurate. However, patients who are unable to care for themselves and suffer from deficits in adaptive life functioning often have negative symptoms as well as severe cognitive impairment. The strong correlation with cognitive function, even when the severity of negative symptoms is considered, suggests that interventions aimed at improvement of adaptive outcome may be targeted at enhancement of cognition. These interventions may include atypical neuroleptic medications and augmentation strategies directly targeting cognition with specific agents that may not affect the positive or negative symptoms of the illness.",

The appropriate therapy in this case is a withdrawal of analgesics, for which the patient needs to be hospitalised. The recovery process after hospitalisation depends heavily on the after treatment. Factors for a favourable prognosis are the length of the abuse period (less than 5 years), the use of dihydergot as a pain-killer, motivation of the patient and the support of the family and the patient's immediate environment.",

      "title": "Role of nucleus accumbens glutamatergic plasticity in drug addiction",
      "abstract": "Substance dependence is characterized by a group of symptoms, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). These symptoms include tolerance, withdrawal, drug consumption for alleviating withdrawal, exaggerated consumption beyond original intention, failure to reduce drug consumption, expending a considerable amount of time obtaining or recovering from the substance's effects, disregard of basic aspects of life (for example, family), and maintenance of drug consumption, despite facing adverse consequences. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a brain structure located in the basal forebrain of vertebrates, and it has been the target of addictive drugs. Different neurotransmitter systems at the level of the NAc circuitry have been linked to the different problems of drug addiction, like compulsive use and relapse. The glutamate system has been linked mainly to relapse after drug-seeking extinction. The dopamine system has been linked mainly to compulsive drug use. The glutamate homeostasis hypothesis centers around the dynamics of synaptic and extrasynaptic levels of glutamate, and their impact on circuitry from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the NAc. After repetitive drug use, deregulation of this homeostasis increases the release of glutamate from the PFC to the NAc during drug relapse. Glial cells also play a fundamental role in this hypothesis; glial cells shape the interactions between the PFC and the NAc by means of altering glutamate levels in synaptic and extrasynaptic spaces. On the other hand, cocaine self-administration and withdrawal increases the surface expression of subunit glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1) of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors at the level of the NAc. Also, cocaine self-administration and withdrawal induce the formation of subunit glutamate receptor 2 (GluA2), lacking the Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) at the level of the NAc. Antagonism of the CP-AMPARs reduces cravings. It is necessary to pursue further exploration of the AMPA receptor subunit composition and variations at the level of the NAc for a better understanding of glutamatergic plastic changes. It is known that cocaine and morphine are able to induce changes in dendritic spine morphology by modifying actin cycling. These changes include an initial increase in spine head diameter and increases in AMPA receptor expression, followed by a second stage of spine head diameter retraction and reduction of the AMPA receptors' expression in spines. Besides glutamate and dopamine, other factors, like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), can influence NAc activity and induce changes in dendritic spine density. BDNF also induces drug-related behaviors like self-administration and relapse. Neither apoptosis nor neurogenesis plays a relevant role in the neurobiological processes subjacent to cocaine addiction in adults (rodent or human). Different therapeutic drugs like N-acetylcysteine (NAC), modafinil, acamprosate, and topiramate have been tested in preclinical and/or clinical models for alleviating drug relapse. Moreover, these therapeutic drugs target the glutamatergic circuitry between the PFC and the NAc. NAC and acamprosate have shown inconsistent results in clinical trials. Modafinil and topiramate have shown some success, but more clinical trials are necessary. Based on the current review findings, it could be recommendable to explore therapeutic approaches that include synergism between different drugs and neurotransmitter systems. The discrepancy in the results of some therapeutic drugs between preclinical versus clinical trials for alleviating relapse or drug dependence could be linked to the scarce exploration of preclinical models that mimic polydrug abuse patterns, for example, cocaine plus alcohol. At the clinical level, the pattern of polydrug consumption is a phenomenon of considerable frequency. Finally, as a complement at the end, an updated summary is included about the role of glutamate in other neuropsychiatric disorders (for example, mood disorders, schizophrenia, and others).",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

Su rasgo cardinal, la anhedonia, se vincula con alteraciones en la neurotransmisión dopaminérgica, desbalances energéticos neuronales y procesos neuroinflamatorios.Este trabajo describe la evolución natural del síndrome cuando no recibe diagnóstico ni intervención: desde la fase inicial con apatía fluctuante (0–6 meses), pasando por depresión persistente (6–18 meses), hasta la cronificación con deterioro funcional (2–3 años) y finalmente la progresión a cuadros de neurodegeneración y riesgo vital por suicidio (5–10 años). Con base en evidencia epidemiológica mexicana, se estima que entre 2–5% de la población adulta podría encajar en este fenotipo, aunque gran parte permanece infradiagnosticada y se autogestiona con conductas compensatorias de alto riesgo (consumo de azúcares, alcohol, nicotina).Se discuten los factores aceleradores (variabilidad glucémica, insomnio, sedentarismo, dieta proinflamatoria) y moduladores protectores (actividad física estructurada, dieta antiinflamatoria, higiene del sueño, reducción de azúcares), así como la urgencia de protocolos integrativos que permitan diferenciar esta condición de otros cuadros psiquiátricos tradicionales.El presente análisis busca aportar al reconocimiento clínico y científico de un síndrome que, de no ser visibilizado, condena a miles de pacientes a diagnósticos erróneos, tratamientos ineficaces y al deterioro progresivo de su salud física, mental y social.",

      "abstract": "Delirium is an organic mental syndrome defined by a global disturbance in consciousness and cognition, which develops abruptly and often fluctuates over the course of the day. It is precipitated by medical illness, substance intoxication/withdrawal or medication effect. Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is a leading presenting symptom of illness in the elderly. Elderly patients with altered mental status, including agitation, should be presumed to have delirium until proven otherwise. The clinical manifestations of delirium are highly variable. A mental status evaluation is crucial in the diagnosis of delirium. Medical evaluation and stabilization should occur in parallel. Life-threatening etiologies including hypoxia, hypoglycemia and hypotension require immediate intervention. The differential diagnosis of etiologies of delirium is extensive. Patients with delirium need thorough evaluations to determine the underlying causes of the delirium. Pharmacological agents should be considered when agitated patient has the potential to harm themselves or others, or is impeding medical evaluation and management. Unfortunately, the evidence to guide pharmacologic management of acute agitation in the elderly is limited. Current pharmacologic options include the typical and atypical antipsychotic agents and the benzodiazepines. These therapeutic options are reviewed in detail.",

      "abstract": "Abstract MCI is a transitional state between the cognitive changes of normal aging and very early dementia. As the field of aging and dementia moves toward early identification of cognitive symptoms, MCI has become an area of active research. Most clinicians believe that neurodegenerative processes evolve over years and perhaps decades. Thus, the concept of an intermediate stage of impairment between normal aging and early dementia needs to be clarified. MCI has evolved to represent this transitional zone (Figure). According to recent research, MCI can be classified into three subtypes: 1) amnestic MCI, in which the person has a memory impairment out of proportion to performance in other cognitive areas; 2) multidomain MCI, in which the person has a slight impairment in several cognitive domains, for example, language, attention, executive function, and visuospatial skills with or without a memory impairment, although these deficits are mild and not sufficient to constitute dementia; and 3) single non-memory domain MCI, in which the person is impaired in a non-memory area in relative isolation to the other cognitive domains.",

      "title": "Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is characterized by clusters of nocturnal motor seizures, which are often stereotyped and brief (5 seconds to 5 minutes). They vary from simple arousals from sleep to dramatic, often bizarre hyperkinetic events with tonic or dystonic features. Affected individuals may experience aura. Retained awareness during seizures is common. A minority of individuals experience daytime seizures. Onset ranges from infancy to adulthood. About 80% of individuals develop ADNFLE in the first two decades of life; mean age of onset is ten years. Clinical neurologic examination is normal and intellect is usually preserved, but reduced intellect, psychiatric comorbidity, or cognitive deficits may occur. Within a family, the manifestations of the disorder may vary considerably. ADNFLE is lifelong but not progressive. As an individual reaches middle age, attacks may become milder and less frequent. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ADNFLE is established in a proband who has suggestive clinical findings combined with a family history that is positive for other affected individuals and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CHRNA4, CHRNB2, CHRNA2, KCNT1, DEPDC5, or CRH on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Carbamazepine is associated with remission in about 70% of individuals, often in relatively low doses. Individuals with ADNFLE associated with the CHRNA4 pathogenic variant p.Ser284Leu are more responsive to zonisamide than carbamazepine. Resistance to AEDs, present in about 30% of affected individuals, requires a trial of all appropriate AEDs. Adjunctive fenofibrate therapy or vagal nerve stimulation may be considered for individuals resistant to AEDs. Surveillance: Reevaluation of EEGs at regular intervals to monitor disease progression. Evaluation of relatives at risk: A medical history from relatives at risk can identify those with ADNFLE so that treatment can be initiated promptly. Pregnancy management: Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given antiepileptic drug during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling ADNFLE is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with ADNFLE have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown, as the frequency of subtle signs of the disorder in parents has not been thoroughly evaluated and molecular genetic data are insufficient. Penetrance is estimated at 70% and the risk to each offspring of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%; thus, the chance that the offspring will manifest ADNFLE is (50% x 70% =) 35%. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible.",

      "abstract": "Transient Epileptic Amnesia is a late-onset form of temporal lobe epilepsy characterized by recurrent attacks of transient retrograde and anterograde amnesia usually lasting less than one hour and beginning in late-middle to old age. Attacks commonly occur on waking, a potentially helpful diagnostic clue. The amnesic attacks may be associated with persistent memory complaints. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical history, wake or sleep - deprived EEG (often repeated) and/or a clear - cut response to anticonvulsivant therapy. The pathophysiology remains poorly understood. It is uncertain whether recurrent episodes of amnesia represent ictal or post-ictal phenomena.",

Inadequate management of neurogenic voiding disorders, especially of urinary incontinence, results in impaired quality of life. Moreover, inadequately treated neurogenic voiding disorders may result in medium and long-term renal complications and even death. Treatment of neurogenic disorders, whatever their origin (spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease), must take into account the gravity of the neurological disease, the potential risks for the upper urinary tract and the expected quality of life. Therefore, each patient must be considered as a separate entity and treated individually. Recent progress in the comprehension of the neurophysiology of the lower urinary tract and the neurophysiopathology of the neurogenic voiding disorders has been followed by the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools aimed at improving the patients' health and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Background: There is a group of optic neuropathies of either genetic or acquired origin characterized by similar clinical manifestations with preferential involvement of the papillomacular bundle (PMB). PMB fibers are most susceptible to injury as they are small, unmyelinated, and have high-energy demands. These optic neuropathies share a presumed common pathophysiology of mitochondrial dysfunction. Evidence Acquisition: A variety of medications cause optic neuropathy by interfering with mitochondrial function. The evidence linking these therapeutic agents as a cause of mitochondrial optic neuropathy (MON) is well established in some and less certain in others. The differential diagnosis includes other optic nerve disorders producing bilateral, symmetric visual loss, including certain nutritional deficiencies, toxins, and genetic diseases. Results: Ethambutol, chloramphenicol, linezolid, erythromycin, streptomycin, and antiretroviral drugs can cause drug-related MON. In many cases, drug toxicity is dose and duration dependent, and discontinuation of the drug in a timely manner can lead to significant visual recovery. Conclusions: Mitochondrial optic neuropathies are increasingly recognized as a spectrum of conditions that reach a similar end point by compromising a common pathway of mitochondrial dysfunction. Clinicians should be aware of drugs that can cause a MON. Prompt recognition of this association is critical in preventing irreversible, profound visual loss.",

These remote effects result from deafferentation, a phenomenon known as \"diaschisis\". After an interval of time, which will vary directly with the severity of the lesion, functional recovery occurs due to synaptic reactivation of neurones. This is favourably influenced by rehabilitation. Diaschisis most commonly manifests itself by such neurological signs as impaired consciousness or cognitive impairments including dementia, dyspraxias, dystaxias, dysphasias, incoordination and sensory neglect. The nature of diaschisis has been demonstrated by widespread depressions of local cerebral blood flow and metabolism extending far beyond the anatomical lesion. Recovery of function is associated with recovery of local perfusion and metabolism. [Neurol Res 1993; 15: 362-366]",

      "abstract": "As it is well known, all living humans are subject to daily effects of stress; the stress response varies among individuals depending on the experience that has endowed each person to learn how to deal with stress. Stress relief may be obtained by procedures that lead the subject to “forget” the bad situation or to relax, for instance physical exercise, talking the problem to someone else, drinking alcoholic beverages or using drugs of abuse. Drug addiction develops in persons voluntarily seeking relief from a depressive situation, usually linked to personal catastrophic event, death of a dear family member or a valuable loss of personal belonging, or else also voluntarily aiming to a novel mood enhancing experience, in spite of being conscious of the unwanted effects – dependence – arising from repetitive drug taking, the most serious being addiction, a persistent state in which compulsive drug use escapes control. Addictive drugs besides providing a pleasant rewarding experience also generate reinforcing behaviors of the drug effects leading to tolerance, dependency compulsion, persistence, chronicity with multiple relapses and withdrawal syndrome. The compulsion and persistence are based on pathological molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in memory. Studies done both in humans and rodent models of addiction indicate that key behavior abnormalities associated with addiction are related to changes in the brain, both at molecular and cellular levels. The plastic changes in the dopaminergic VTA NAc pathway and the interconnected structures, also include changes in the gene transcription, RNA and protein processing and in synaptic structure. All the specific changes so far identified are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the behaviors associated with addiction.",

Any physical symptoms should raise the possibility of an alternative etiology for the patient's amnesia.

Patients who develop transient global amnesia generally are taken by companions to an emergency room. Neuropsychological testing after multiple attacks may reveal more memory impairment as well as visuoperceptual deficits. Transient global amnesia is rare in young or middle-age adults.

Acute fatigue is a normal condition that disappears after a period of rest; in contrast, chronic fatigue does not disappear after an ordinary rest. Chronic fatigue impairs daily activities and contributes to various medical conditions and death. In addition, many people complain of chronic fatigue. It would thus be of great value to clarify the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and to develop efficient treatment methods to overcome it. Here, we review data primarily from behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging experiments related to the neural mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue. We propose that repetitive and prolonged overwork and/or stress cause neural damage of a facilitation system, as well as central sensitization and classical conditioning of an inhibition system. We also propose a new treatment strategy for chronic fatigue on the basis of its underlying neural mechanisms.",

These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "title": "Electrolytes Disturbances and Seizures",
      "abstract": "Electrolyte disturbances are frequently encountered in daily clinical practice. The diagnosis of these abnormalities is commonly made from routine laboratory findings, and they are not usually of clinical significance. However, they may sometimes lead to serious complications when overlooked or not treated appropriately. Electrolyte abnormalities may affect many organs and tissues, including the brain. Most of the clinical manifestations of these derangements are predominantly neurologic and parallel the severity of neuronal damage. Furthermore, these disorders may appear with seizures, or with rapidly progressive neurologic symptoms and signs, and thus require emergency treatment (Rose and Post, 2001; Riggs, 2002). Acute and/or severe electrolyte imbalances frequently cause seizures, and these seizures may be the sole presenting symptom. Seizures are especially common in patients with sodium disorders, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Successful management of patient seizures begins with the establishment of an accurate diagnosis of the underlying electrolyte disturbance, because rapid identification and correction of the disturbance is necessary to control seizures and prevent permanent brain damage (Kunze, 2002; Riggs, 2002). A 61-year-old man was initially seen in the emergency department with nausea and emesis and, after several minutes, tonic–clonic seizures developed. The patient had a previous medical history of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and several hours before admission, he came to the radiology department to undergo a routine abdominal ultrasound examination. To fill his bladder before undertaking the ultrasound test, he drank a copious amount (4–5 L) of water. On physical examination, the patient was confused and disoriented. The neurologic examination was unremarkable. His serum electrolyte levels were as follows: sodium, 112 mEq/L; potassium, 3.4 mEql/L; serum osmolality, 235 mOsm/kg; and blood glucose, 124 mg/dl. Emergency computed tomography of the brain was normal. We diagnosed hyponatremic encephalopathy due to water intoxication and treated with intravenous 3% saline solution. In 48 h, the patient's serum sodium level increased to 136 mM. He made a full clinical recovery. It is clear that better training in management of electrolyte imbalances in patients with seizures is needed to reduce common and serious neurologic morbidity associated with these medical problems. We give an overview of the clinical aspects of electrolyte disturbances associated with seizures, with special regard to the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved and treatment recommendations. Electrolyte homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS) is essential for brain function. Regulation of ionic balance is a critical process involving a complex array of molecules for moving ions into and out of the brain and involving blood–brain barrier function as well as mechanisms in the membranes of both neurons and glia. Alterations in ion gradients across cellular membranes can have direct and indirect effects on neuronal discharge and may facilitate epileptiform activities (Scwartzkroin et al., 1998). A variety of pathological states or conditions such as dehydration or renal failure are associated with substantial modifications of plasma osmolality and electrolyte balance. These conditions may overcome homeostatic brain systems and provoke profound consequences on brain metabolism and function. Clinical manifestations of electrolyte disturbances in the CNS are variable. In general, they represent functional disturbances of the brain, and, at least in the beginning, are generally not associated with morphologic changes in brain tissue. Because neurologic symptoms of electrolyte disorders are generally functional rather than structural, the neurologic manifestations of electrolyte disturbances are typically reversible (Kunze, 2002; Riggs, 2002). However, because functional dysfunction such as seizures can lead to structural alterations, it is important to treat the underlying disturbance before the pathology becomes permanent. Disorders of sodium and osmolality produce CNS neuronal depression, with encephalopathy as the major clinical manifestation; these disorders can also provoke CNS neuronal irritability. Similarly, hypercalcemia and hypermagnesemia produce CNS neuronal depression with encephalopathy. Conversely, hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia cause mainly CNS neuronal irritability with seizures. In contrast, disorders of potassium rarely produce symptoms in the CNS but may be associated with muscle weakness as the major clinical manifestation (Victor and Ropper, 2001; Riggs, 2002) The main features of CNS neuronal depression and encephalopathy are confusion and slight cognitive disturbances. These features may be accompanied by headache, lethargy, weakness, tremor, and so on, usually without signs of focal cerebral disease or a disorder of cranial nerves (Kunze, 2002; Riggs, 2002). Electrolyte disorders frequently cause seizures (Table 1). Seizures are common in patients with sodium disorders, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia (Victor and Ropper, 2001; Riggs, 2002). In such cases, seizures are usually generalized tonic–clonic, although partial seizures or other seizure types can occur. In all these cases, rapidly evolving electrolyte abnormalities are more likely to cause seizures than are those occurring gradually. For this reason, it is not possible to assign absolute levels of electrolyte above or below which seizures are likely to occur (Victor and Ropper, 2001). The correct diagnosis of seizures secondary to electrolyte abnormalities begins with a complete serum chemistry evaluation, including measurements of electrolytes, especially sodium, calcium, and magnesium. This workup should always be part of the initial diagnostic workup in adult patients with a first-time seizures (Browne and Holmes, 2001; Oguni, 2004). Such an electrolyte screen is particularly important in certain patient populations, such as the elderly, in which metabolic disturbances (e.g., hyponatremia or hypoglycemia) are common. Between 15 and 30% of acute symptomatic seizures among seniors occur in the setting of toxic–metabolic causes (LaRoche and Helmers, 2003). Further, identification and correction of electrolyte imbalances leading to seizures are needed to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with these medical problems. Thus in a review of 375 adult cases of status epilepticus (SE), 10% had a metabolic disorder as the primary etiology of their seizure; in this subset of patients, mortality was reported to be as high as 40% (DeLorenzo et al., 1992). It is important to note that laboratory screening tests, based on the American Academy of Neurology recommendations, are not routinely performed in children and should be ordered based on individual clinical circumstances (Hirtz et al., 2000). However, a thorough history and a comprehensive neurologic and general examination remain the cornerstone of the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. Treatment of seizures secondary to electrolyte imbalances is determined by the underlying cause of the disturbance and should be guided by the clinical setting. In most cases of electrolyte imbalance, treatment with an anticonvulsant (AED) is not necessary as long as the underlying disturbance is rectified. Long-term administration of AEDs is not necessary (Victor and Ropper, 2001; Kunze, 2002; Riggs, 2002). Indeed, AEDs alone are generally ineffective if the electrolyte disorder persists. Changes in blood electrolytes may cause diffuse brain dysfunction, metabolic encephalopathy, and consequently EEG abnormalities. The EEG has been widely used to evaluate metabolic encephalopathies since 1937, when Berguer first observed slow brain activity induced by hypoglycemia (Lin, 2005). In general, the most prominent feature of the EEG record in encephalopathies (if a change occurs) is slowing of the normal background frequency. A gradual and progressive decline over the course of the disease may be noted if serial EEGs are performed. Disorganization of the record may develop gradually, and reactivity to photic or other types of external stimulation may be altered (Kaplan, 2004a). EEG evolution generally correlates well with the severity of encephalopathy. However, EEG has little specificity in differentiating etiologies in most encephalopathies. Particularly in metabolic encephalopathies, common EEG observations include a varied degree of slowing, assorted mixtures of epileptiform discharges, high incidence of triphasic waves (TWs), and (as a rule) reversibility after treatment of underlying causes (Kaplan, 2004a; Lin, 2005). The rate of change of electrolyte balance is more important in determining the degree of EEG abnormality than is the absolute level of a given electrolyte or metabolite. For instance, EEG changes are usually more severe in uremic encephalopathy if acute deterioration of renal function exists (Smith, 2005). Hyponatremia usually produces nonspecific slowing. Very low sodium levels may initially produce posterior slowing followed by diffuse delta activity correlated clinically with papilledema. However, a variety of other patterns have been described, such as TWs, burst of high-voltage rhythmic delta activity, and central high-voltage 6-Hz to 7-Hz activity with stimulation-induced paroxysms of delta waves. Although periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges may occur, full seizure activity is very rare (Reddy and Moorthy, 2001; Kaplan, 2004a). Early EEG changes associated with hypocalcemia include evolution from alpha through theta and delta dominance. Other EEG findings (generalized spikes, sharp-waves burst of delta activity with sharp components). Generalized paroxysmal discharges and absence SE have also been reported (Kapplan, 2004a). Neonatal records may show reversible 3- to 4-Hz spike–waves discharges (Kossoff, 2002). No strict correlation links serum calcium level to seizure threshold and/or EEG changes in hypocalcemia. In hypercalcemia, EEG changes (fast activity and burst of delta and theta slowing) appear when calcium levels reach ∼13 mg/dl. As calcium level increases, increased background slowing (largely frontal), paroxysmal theta/delta bursts, and TWs may appear (Juvarra et al., 1985; Kaplan, 2004a). Diffuse and more occipital spike–slow-wave complexes may be found, suggesting a calcium-mediated vasospastic effect in the posterior cerebral circulation, also noted with very high calcium levels (Kaplan, 1998). When calcium is normalized, the EEG usually improves, but only gradually. Hyponatremia is defined as a decrease in the serum sodium concentration to a level <136 mEq/L. Hyponatremia is reported to be the cause of seizures in 70% of infants younger than 6 months who lacked findings suggesting another cause (Farrar et al., 1995). The main causes of hyponatremia are listed in Table 2. The major dangers from acute hyponatremia are brain cell swelling and herniation. Serious symptoms, principally neurologic, may become evident when hyponatremia approaches 120 mM (Riggs, 2002). Brain adaptive mechanisms to changes in osmolality help explain these adverse events. When serum sodium decreases, cerebral edema is counteracted initially by an adaptive process known as the \"regulatory volume decrease,\" with the displacement of water from the interstitial space to the cerebrospinal fluid and then to the systemic circulation. This process is driven by hydrostatic pressure. Subsequently, the brain prevents swelling by the extrusion from brain cells of electrolytes. Partial restoration of brain volume occurs within ∼3 h (rapid adaptation), with the extrusion from brain cells of these electrolytes: sodium, potassium, and chloride. A second cellular adaptation mechanism to osmolality changes is the egress from the brain cells of organic osmolytes (osmotically active agents), primarily amino acids, which is almost fully achieved after 48 h (slow adaptation) (Gullans and Verbalis, 1993; Bhardwaj, 2006). These organic osmolytes, known previously as \"idiogenic osmoles,\" play an important role in this cellular adaptation to chronic osmolality changes. If the decline in serum sodium is slow and gradual (≥48 h), cerebral swelling and neurologic symptoms are minimized by these adaptive processes, even if the absolute reduction of serum sodium is large. In acute hyponatremia, a rapid decrease in serum sodium can overwhelm these protective mechanisms, causing swelling of the brain and the development of neurologic symptoms (Adrogué and Madias, 2000a; Bhardwaj, 2006). In the past, it had been assumed that the likelihood of brain damage from hyponatremia was directly related to either a rapid decline in plasma sodium or a particularly low level of plasma sodium. Recent studies have demonstrated that other factors influence outcome, including the age and the gender of the individual (with children and menstruant women the most susceptible) (Fraser and Arieff, 1997; Bhardwaj, 2006). Thus it is estimated that women have a 25-fold increased risk compared with men of death or permanent neurologic damage as a result of the hyponatremia (Reeves et al., 1998). Hypoxia and ischemia impair the brain adaptive mechanisms to hyponatremia and worsen the cerebral edema. This point is clinically important, because it also justifies a quick and appropriate treatment of patients' seizures. Finally, this process of adaptation by the brain is also the source of the risk of osmotic demyelination. The correction of hyponatremia triggers a \"de-adaptation\" process, during which the electrolytes reaccumulate rapidly in the brain cell, but the reentry of organic osmolytes occurs much more slowly. Therefore in patients with chronic hyponatremia, it has been hypothesized that rapid correction of serum sodium—before a readjustment of intracellular osmolytes concentrations occurs—results in loss of water from neurons and glia; this process carries with it the danger of provoking osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), associated with pontine and extrapontine demyelination (Reeves et al., 1998; Adrogué and Madias, 2000a; Riggs, 2002). However, some investigators have demonstrated that ODS does not depend on the rate of correction of hyponatremia alone but also on concurrent insults [e.g., alcoholism, anoxic brain injury, or severe liver dysfunction (Ayus et al., 1992; Bhradwaj, 2006)]. Hyponatremia has been associated with several AEDs, such as carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC), and occasionally with valproate (VPA) and lamotrigine (LTG) (Grikiniené et al., 2004). The frequency of hyponatremia in OXC (a 10-keto analogue of CBZ)-treated patients is even higher than in those receiving CBZ (Dong et al., 2005). The prevalence ranges—from 1.8% to 40% with CBZ and 23% to 73% with OXC—depends on the patient population studied (Dong et al., 2005; Kuz and Manssourian, 2005). Several risk factors have been reported to increase the risk of hyponatremia associated with these drugs: older age, polypharmacy, menstruation, surgery, underlying renal disease, psychiatric condition, and female gender, among others (Van Amelsvoort et al., 1994; Kuz and Manssourian, 2005). The mechanisms whereby CBZ and OXC cause hyponatremia are not entirely clear; however, a peripheral process—the induction of excessive water reabsorption in the collecting tubule—is thought to be the cause (Ranta and Wooten, 2004). Currently no consistent view exists on the association between CBZ or OXC dose and hyponatremia (Ranta and Wooten, 2004). It is likely that a degree of individual susceptibility exists for those cases in which CBZ or OXC causes symptomatic hyponatremia. Hyponatremia secondary to CBZ and OXC is more common in clinical practice than is seen in the clinical trials, but most of these patients are asymptomatic. Hyponatremia, if it occurs, tends to develop within the first 3 months of drug treatment. Routine monitoring of plasma sodium is not necessary, except for patients with diseases or medications predisposing to hyponatremia (e.g., renal diseases, diuretics) and may also be advisable in patients exhibiting related symptoms (blurred vision, weakness, headache, confusion, and worsening seizures). Advanced age is consider a risk factor, and therefore elderly patients should be monitored (Smith, 2001; Dong et al., 2005). Treatment can involve removal of the precipitating factors (such as diuretics or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) or water restriction; dose reduction, and if required, discontinuation of the CBZ or OXC therapy (Smith, 2001; Ranta and Wooten, 2004), should be considered at sodium levels of ≤120–125 mEq/L. The manifestations of hypotonic hyponatremia are largely related to dysfunction of the CNS and are more conspicuous when the decrease in serum sodium concentration is large or rapid (within hours) (Reeves et al., 1998; Adrogué and Madias, 2000a). In general, symptoms of hyponatremia parallel the severity of cerebral edema. Chronic hypernatremia is less likely to induce symptoms; approximately half of the patients with chronic hyponatremia are asymptomatic, even with serum sodium concentration less than 125 mEq/L (Reeves et al., 1998). Symptoms rarely occur until the serum sodium is less than 120 mEq/L and are more usually associated with values around 110 mEq/L or lower. Children are at particular high risk of developing symptomatic hyponatremia, as they have a larger brain-to-skull size ratio. Complications of severe and rapidly evolving hyponatremia include seizures, usually generalized tonic–clonic. Seizures generally occur if the plasma sodium concentration rapidly decreases to <115 mEq/L; they represent an ominous sign and also a medical emergency, as they are associated with high mortality (Riggs, 2002). A relatively small increase in the serum sodium concentration—on the order of 5%—can substantially reduce cerebral edema; seizures induced by hyponatremia can be stopped by rapid increases in the serum sodium concentration that average only 3 to 7 mEq/L (Adrogué and Madias, 2000a). Improvement in neurologic function associated with hyponatremia may lag days behind correction of the electrolyte abnormality, particularly in the older patient (Luckey and Parsa, 2003). Treatment for acute symptomatic hyponatremia must be prompt because brain pathologic processes may be rapid and irreversible, even when clinical symptoms are mild (Adrogué and Madias, 2000a). Hypertonic saline (3%), the most common treatment for acute symptomatic hyponatremia, causes a quick decline in brain volume, thereby lowering intracranial pressure. Treatment should target increases in serum sodium to more than 120 to 125 mEq/L. Importantly, aggressive treatment of hyponatremia with hypertonic saline solution can be also hazardous, because this approach can provoke shrinkage of the brain that triggers ODS and can cause neurologic dysfunction including quadriplegia, pseudobulbar palsy, seizures, coma, and even death (Reeves et al., 1998; Adrogué and Madias, 2000a; Riggs, 2002). On the basis of the available data, it seems prudent to correct the sodium concentration at a rate of 0.5 mEq/L/h. However, in young women at a risk for respiratory arrest, severe neurologic sequelae, and death, a rate of 1 to 2 mEq/L/h has been used (Soupart and Decaux, 1996; Adrogué and Madias, 2000a); higher correction rates appear to be well tolerated in children (Sarnaik et al., 1991). Increasing evidence indicates that brain demyelinating lesions may occur in patients despite a careful correction of hyponatremia (Ayus et al., 1992; Leens et al., 2001; Bhradwaj, 2006). It is therefore important to identify additional risk factors for brain demyelination, such as hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, seizure-induced hypoxemia, and malnutrition with vitamin B deficiency, and to approach treatment accordingly. Hypernatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration in plasma >145 mEq/L. Whereas hyponatremia may cause seizures, hypernatremia is more likely to be a result of seizure activity (e.g., generalized tonic–clonic seizures). Intracellular glycogen is metabolized to lactate in muscle during seizures. As lactate is more osmotically active than glycogen, intracellular osmolality of muscle fibers increases, and water moves into cells, causing hypernatremia. The most frequent causes of hypernatremia are cited in Table 2. The same brain adaptive mechanisms that respond to hypoosmotic changes in osmolality also act in hypernatremia. Within minutes after hypernatremia occurs, loss of water from brain cells causes shrinkage of the brain and an increase in intracellular brain cell osmolality. Cells immediately respond to combat this shrinkage and change in osmotic pressure by moving electrolytes across the cell membrane, leading to partial restitution of brain volume within a few hours (rapid adaptation). The normalization of brain volume is completed within several days (slow adaptation) as a result of the intracellular accumulation of organic osmolytes (Reeves et al., 1998; Adrogué and Madias, 2000b). Although most of the change of brain osmolality in chronic hyponatremia can be accounted for by the changes in organic osmolytes, little accumulation of these osmoles occurs with acute hypernatremia (the development of organic electrolyte shifts occur significantly more slowly than the changes in serum sodium). Therefore the degree of CNS disturbance in hypernatremia is related mainly to the rate at which the serum sodium increases. In acute (within hours) hypernatremic states, water is lost from the brain, and the acute shrinkage in brain volume (especially in infants) results in hypernatremic encephalopathy. In chronic hypernatremic states, CNS cells accumulate organic osmolytes, and brain shrinkage is minimized, as are CNS symptoms. In theory, rapid correction of the hypernatremic state may result in cerebral edema, as water uptake by brain cells outpaces the dissipation of accumulated electrolytes and organic osmolytes. Thus overly aggressive therapy carries the risk of serious neurologic impairment due to cerebral edema (Reeves et al., 1998; Adrogué and Madias, 2000b; Riggs, 2002). However, the major factor responsible for hypernatremic encephalopathy and the impairment of neuronal function in this state is not well understood. Hypernatremic encephalopathy and death can occur in the absence of pathologic changes in the CNS (other than brain shrinkage and increase in brain NaCl content). Investigators have hypothesized that the combination of hyperosmolality and cellular shrinkage leads to alteration of the synaptic structure and function of brain cells, leading to an encephalopathic state (Reeves et al., 1998; Victor and Ropper, 2001). Just as in hyponatremia, the symptoms of hypernatremia are primarily neurologic and are related mainly to the rate at which the serum sodium increases (Reeves et al., 1998; Adrogué and Madias, 2000b). Chronic hypernatremia is less likely to induce neurologic symptoms than is acute hypernatremia. Slowly increasing sodium values, to levels as high as 170 mEq/L, are often well tolerated. Severe symptoms usually require an acute (within hours) elevation in the plasma sodium concentration to >158–160 mEq/L. Values >180 mEq/L are associated with a high mortality rate, particularly in adults (Adrogué and Madias, 2000b). Brain shrinkage induced by hypernatremia can cause rupture of cerebral veins, with focal intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages, which in turn can provoke seizures. In hypernatremic infants, convulsions are typically absent, except in cases of inadvertent sodium loading or aggressive rehydration (Adrogué and Madias, 2000b). Although rapid sodium loading can cause seizures, convulsions are more frequently seen during rapid correction of hypernatremia. In patients with prolonged hypernatremia, cerebral edema may appear when the osmolality is abruptly normalized; this correction therefore may lead to convulsions, coma, and death. Seizures occur in ≤40% of patients treated for severe hypernatremia by rapid infusion of hypotonic solutions (Reeves et al., 1998). The goal in treating hypernatremia is to replenish body water, thereby restoring osmotic homeostasis and cell volume at a rate that avoids significant complications. The speed of correction depends on the speed of development of hypernatremia and accompanying symptoms (Adrogué and Madias, 2000b; Kang et al., 2002). The rate of correction of chronic hypernatremia should not exceed 0.5–0.7 mEq/L/h; this rate should prevent cerebral edema and convulsions. The targeted decrease in the serum sodium concentration in patients with hypernatremia, except in those in whom the disorder has developed over a period of hours, is of 10 mEq/L/day. Acute hypernatremia may be treated more rapidly; in such patients, reducing the serum sodium concentration by 1 mEq/L/h is appropriate (Reeves et al., 1998; Kong et al., 2002). Patients with hypernatremia may be treated with hypotonic fluids (hypotonic saline or dextrose solutions). The preferred route for administering fluids is orally (or via a feeding tube); if this approach is not feasible, fluids should be given intravenously. Because the risk of cerebral edema increases with the volume of the infusate, the volume should be restricted to that required to correct hypertonicity (Adrogué and Madias, 2000b). Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is appropriate only in case of frank circulatory compromise, as it provides an effective mean of volume expansion. Hypocalcemia is defined as a plasma calcium level of <8.5 mg/dl or an ionized calcium concentration <4.0 mg/dl. The causes of hypocalcemia are summarized in Table 2. The symptoms of hypocalcemia are influenced by the degree of hypocalcemia and the rapidity of the decrease in the serum ionized calcium concentration (Bringhurst et al., 1998). Acute hypocalcemia primary causes increased neuromuscular excitability and tetany. In the CNS, the usual manifestations of acute hypocalcemia are seizures and altered mental status (Victor and Ropper, 2001; Riggs, 2002). Generalized tonic–clonic, focal motor, and (less frequently) atypical absence or akinetic seizures can occur in hypocalcemia and may be the sole presenting symptom (Riggs, 2002; Mrowka et al., 2004). Nonconvulsive status epilepticus secondary to hypocalcemia has also been reported (Kline et al., 1998). Seizures may occur without muscular tetany in patients with hypocalcemia. Seizures occur in 20–25% of patients with acute hypocalcemia as a medical emergency, and in 30–70% of patients with symptomatic hypoparathyroidism (Messing and Simon, 1986; Gupta, 1989). The urgency of treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the degree of hypocalcemia. Acute hypocalcemia is an emergency that requires prompt attention, and patients with symptomatic hypocalcemia should be treated immediately because of the highly associated morbidity and mortality. Treatment with intravenous calcium is the most appropriate therapy. Doses of 100 to 300 mg of elemental calcium should be infused (i.v.) over a period of 10 to 20 min. Calcium-infusion drips should be started at 0.5 mg/kg/h and continued for several hours, with close monitoring of calcium levels (Bringhurst et al., 1998). Treatment for hypocalcemic seizures is calcium replacement; AEDs are typically not needed. AEDs may abolish both overt and latent tetany, whereas hypocalcemic seizures may remain refractory (Messig and Simon, 1986; Kossoff et al., 2002; Bellazzani and Howes, 2005). Obviously, the treatment of hypocalcemia should be directed at the underlying disorder, and oral calcium repletion is commonly prescribed for outpatient treatment. Hypercalcemia is much more common than hypocalcemia. However, in contrast to hypocalcemia, seizures are rarely associated with hypercalcemia (serum calcium level of ≥10.5 mg/dl). The etiologies of hypercalcemia are summarized in Table 2. The most common symptoms of severe hypercalcemia are those referable to disturbances of nervous system and gastrointestinal function (Bringhurst et al., 1998; Riggs, 2002). Symptoms of hypercalcemia depend on the underlying cause of the condition, the rapidity with which it develops, and the overall physical health of the patient. A rapid increase to moderate (12–13.9 mg/dl) hypercalcemia frequently results in marked neurologic dysfunction, whereas chronic severe hypercalcemia (≥14 mg/dl) may cause only minimal neurologic symptoms (Marx, 2000). Alterations of mental status—lethargy, confusion, and rarely coma—are the main neurologic manifestations of hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia is associated with reduced neuronal membrane excitability, and thus rarely causes seizures. However, hypercalcemia-induced hypertensive encephalopathy and vasoconstriction have been hypothesized to give rise to seizures (Chen et al., 2004; Smith, 2005). Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction in a patient with hypercalcemia-induced seizures has been showed by cerebral angiography (Chen et al., 2004). The indication for urgent therapy for hypercalcemia usually reflects the presence of clinical manifestations and the underlying cause of the problem, rather than the level of serum calcium. Severe hypercalcemia should be treated aggressively. Treatment often entails hydration and administration of hypocalcemic agents such as intravenous bisphosphonate (e.g., pamidronate or zoledronate) or calcitonin (Bringhurst et al., 1998; Stewart, 2005) [These are medications used to decrease calcium serum level. Their mechanisms of action are numerous (e.g., inhibition of normal and abnormal bone resorption)]. Rapid and controlled correction: first, vigorous rehydration with normal saline should be initiated, at a rate of 200 to 500 ml/h, monitoring fluid overload. Then 20–40 mg furosemide is given intravenously, after rehydration has been achieved. Consider intravenous bisphosphonates: pamidronate (60–90 mg i.v. over a 2-h period) or zoledronate (4 mg i.v. over a 15-min period). Second line: glucocorticoids, calcitonin, mithramycin, gallium nitrate. Treatment of the underlying disorder with hypocalcemic diet. Consider oral bisphosphonates. Hypomagnesemia is defined as a plasma concentration <1.6 mEq/L (<1.9 mg/dl). Magnesium is recommended for anticonvulsant treatment in preeclampsia and eclampsia (Kaplan, 2004). The inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors and the increased production of vasodilator prostaglandins in the brain could explain the anticonvulsant action of magnesium (Kaplan, 2004b). Additionally, magnesium serves to stabilize neuronal membranes. The main causes of hypomagnesemia are cited in Table 2. Symptoms do not appear unless Mg2+ decreases to <1.2 mg/dl, and they may not correlate well with serum ionized Mg2+ levels. The primary clinical findings are neuromuscular irritability, CNS hyperexcitability, and cardiac arrhythmias. Seizures, usually generalized tonic–clonic, can occur in neonates and adults in association with severe hypomagnesemia, at levels <1 mEq/L (Riggs, 2002). Patients with mild, asymptomatic hypomagnesemia can be treated with oral magnesium (e.g., magnesium gluconate), usually given in divided doses totaling 500 mg/d. In the setting of seizures or symptomatic or severe (<1.2 mg/dl, <1 mEq/L) hypomagnesemia, it is advisable to inject 1 to 2 g of MgS over a 5-min period, to be followed by an infusion of 1 to 2 g of MgS per hour for the next few hours. If seizures persist, the bolus may be repeated (Riggs, 2002; Dubé and Granry, 2003). Potassium and magnesium levels should be monitored during therapy. These dosages should be reduced in patients with renal insufficiency. Unlike other electrolyte alterations, hypokalemia or hyperkalemia rarely causes symptoms in the CNS, and seizures do not occur. Changes in the extracellular potassium level (serum levels) have predominant and profound effects on the function of the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems. Thus severe potassium abnormality may provoke fatal arrhythmias or muscle paralysis before CNS symptoms appear (Gennari, 1998; Riggs, 2002) In summary, seizures often represent an important clinical manifestation of electrolyte disturbances. Seizures are more common in patients with sodium disorders, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Successful management of patient seizures begins with the establishment of an accurate diagnosis of the underlying electrolyte disturbances. For that reason, complete serum chemistry, including measurements of electrolytes, especially sodium, calcium, and magnesium, should be part of the initial diagnostic workup in adult patients with seizures. Early identification and correction of these disturbances are necessary to control seizures and prevent permanent brain damage, as AEDs alone are generally ineffective. All physicians should be aware of these clinical conditions and have an understanding of the underlying medical disorders, for this may provide the means of controlling the disease and initiate a rapid and appropriate therapy.",

      "abstract": "Brief REM latencies, i.e. abnormally short intervals between sleep onset and the occurrence of the first REM period in polygraphic recordings of night sleep, have been proposed in recent years to be of diagnostic value for primary and endogenous depressions. It was also postulated that therapeutic success of antidepressant drugs can be predicted from this characteristic. Analysis of recent studies shows, however, that none of these claims can be maintained: although brief REM latencies do occur more frequently in middle-aged and elderly depressed patients than in healthy controls, this - strongly age-dependent - feature is neither sensitive to nor specific of depressions and therefore unlikely to facilitate their diagnosis. Similarly, there are no valid indications that brief REM latencies might predict success or failure of antidepressant drug treatment. Heterogeneous results of the studies reviewed are probably due to inhomogeneous selection of patient and control groups, variable periods of withdrawal of previous medication and other procedural differences.",

These alterations in memory are due to several factors, such as the aetiology of the epilepsy, age at onset of the seizures, the duration of the disorder, and the frequency and type of the epileptic seizures.These memory defects reflect the structural and functional damage caused by the repeated epileptic seizures and/or the anti-epileptic drugs. Apart from this, neuro-surgical treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy may also lead to memory defects. These will depend on the site and side of the epileptic focus, the level of memory prior to surgery, the age of onset of the epileptic seizures, the chronological age at the time of operation and the reduction in the number of seizures after surgery. In spite of the evidence that memory is affected in patients with epilepsy, this does not mean that all people with epilepsy have these changes.Neuropsychological examination is of fundamental clinical importance since it allows the evaluation of cognitive function in each patient, and thus permits optimization of both the pharmacological treatment and intellectual and physical performance.",

At an early stage of most neurodegenerative diseases, including the Frontotemporal Dementias, it can be very difficult to determine whether a person has symptoms of a progressive illness or is suffering from a condition less likely to progress, or even exhibiting symptoms consistent with normal aging. It is critical to identify individuals with MCI, since people with this clinical syndrome are at elevated risk of progressive cognitive decline. In the case of Primary Progressive Aphasia, a neurodegenerative disease in which speech and/or language abilities are gradually lost, a speech-language pathologist (SLP) may be one of the initial clinical providers in the MCI stage. The SLP is therefore critical in helping to determine whether a change in language abilities is a result of normal aging, a neurodegenerative process, or other etiologies.",

      "abstract": "Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that is also used for off-label indications such as the mediation of analgesia and sedation in various settings. It is additionally recognized as an agent with antidepressant potential. For depression, it is most commonly administered as a slow intravenous infusion in subanesthetic doses (usually 0.5 mg/kg). As an antidepressant, is strikingly different from conventional antidepressant drugs in that it brings about rapid and marked attenuation of depressive symptoms even in patients with refractory depression. The benefits are observed within hours of administration, peak after about a day, and are lost 3-12 days later. Patients who do not benefit after the initial dose may benefit with serial dosing or at higher doses. Benefits can be maintained for weeks to months by the continuation of ketamine sessions at 2- to 4-day intervals. Adverse effects include dissociative and psychotomimetic changes that are almost always mild and transient, if present; transient elevation of heart rate and blood pressure often occur. These changes are usually well tolerated and are very seldom responsible for treatment discontinuation. Whereas ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, and whereas much is known about its different biological effects, its actions that mediate the antidepressant response are presently not known for certain. Although big data on ketamine are presently unavailable, the drug holds promise in the treatment of depression, especially refractory depression.",

      "title": "Where do we go in occupational neuroepidemiology?",
      "abstract": "Early knowledge about the neurotoxic effects of occupational exposures appeared through clinical observations. The observed effects were more or less acute and concerned exposure to metals such as lead and mercury or solvents like carbon disulfide and trichloroethylene. With time, however, also more chronic and clinically less obvious effects of neurotoxic agents have been assessed through modern examination methods and systematic studies of larger groups. Still, the interpretation of the findings has been controversial and debated, such as the chronic effects of solvent exposure (1). The difficulties met in interpreting chronic neurotoxic effects depend on both the diversity and vagueness of symptoms and signs and the associated problem of defining a proper disease entity for conclusive epidemiologic studies. For example, in solvent exposure, the chronic effects might include memory and concentration problems, tiredness, lack of initiative, affect lability, irritability, and sometimes dizziness, headache, alcohol intolerance, and reduced libido. Neurophysiological methods have also revealed various functional disturbances, again difficult to condense into any single disease entity. Similarly, a variety of neurobehavioral effects also seems to occur due to other occupational exposures, such as moderate lead exposure or welding with some exposure to aluminum, lead, and manganese or exposure to pesticides. Again there are also neurophysiological or neurological signs, among others, polyneuropathy, tremor, and disturbance of equilibrium, in individuals exposed to organochlorine, organophosphorus and other insecticides. In view of the epidemiologic problems involved in defining a disease entity out of the many types of neurobehavioral effects referred to, it has also become natural to consider some clinically, more or less well-defined neuropsychiatric disorders in relation to occupational exposures. Since the 1970s, several studies have especially focused on solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome, when of disabling severity. More recently also Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and related conditions have attracted interest in occupational epidemiology. Regarding solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome (or toxic chronic encephalopathy in clinical occupational medicine, when exposure is taken into diagnostic account), the problem of defining a proper disease entity was apparent and it first led to considering en bloc the diagnoses of encephalopathia, dementia, and cerebral atrophy, but also neurosis, neurasthenia, and nervositas were included as not necessarily distinct from each other in medical practice (2). Recently, more specific disease entities, such as organic dementia and cerebral atrophy, have also been associated with solvent exposure (3). The findings have not been totally consistent, however, as no excess of \"presenile dementia\" appeared in a large-scale case-referent study in the United States with as many as 3565 cases of various neuropsychiatric disorders and 83 245 hospital referents (4). However, in comparison with bricklayers, there was about a 45% excess of disabling neuropsychiatric disorders among white male painters, except spray painters. Occupational exposures also seem to play a role for disorders more specific than the psychoorganic syndrome. Hence, in 1982, an association between multiple sclerosis and solvent exposure from glues was first indicated in the Italian shoe industry (5). This relationship has been considerably strengthened by further studies in Scandinavia (6--8) and elsewhere, so that 13 studies with some information on solvent exposure could be considered in a review (9). Ten of these studies provided enough data for inclusion in a meta-analysis, showing about a twofold risk for multiple sclerosis among individuals with solvent exposure. Some studies also associate multiple sclerosis with radiological work, welding, and work with phenoxy herbicides (6--7). Parkinson's disease seems to be more common in rural areas (10), especially at younger ages (11). More interestingly, a study from Calgary, Canada, showed a threefold risk for herbicide exposure (12). All the case persons who recalled specific exposures reported exposure to phenoxy herbicides or thiocarbamates. One of them recalled exposure to paraquat, which is chemically similar to MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), an inducer of a Parkinson-like syndrome. Paraquat workers have not yet been found to suffer from such a syndrome, however (13). Case-referent studies from Canada, China, Spain, and Sweden have indicated a relation with exposure to unspecified industrial chemicals, pesticides, and metals, especially manganese, iron and aluminum (14). In a study from the United States, an increased risk of motor neuron disease (encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy and progressive muscular atrophy) appeared in connection with welding and soldering (15). Welding also appeared as a risk factor, as did electricity work, and also work with impregnating agents in a Swedish study (16). Hereditability for neurodegenerative and thyroid disease, combined with solvent exposure and male gender, showed a risk as high as 15.6. Other studies also indicate that exposure to lead and solvents could be of importance (17--20). For Alzheimer's disease, no clear indication of any occupational risk appeared in a meta-analysis of 11 case-referent studies (21), but more recently an increased risk was connected with blue-collar work (22). Another new study, which included also the oldest ages, indicated that solvent exposure could be a rather strong risk factor (33). The recent suggestion that Alzheimer's disease might be related to exposure to electromagnetic fields was perhaps even more surprising (44). Both these studies are likely to stimulate interest in several new investigations along the indicated lines. Hence, in view of the current perspectives in occupational neuroepidemiology, as briefly outlined, there seems to be a reason for conducting additional work-related studies of different, hitherto more or less neglected, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. It is not unlikely that there are some contributing effects from various occupational exposures, in the same manner as we have seen for many cancer types. In addition, as in etiologic cancer research, new clues suggesting ultimate causes or triggering mechanisms behind some of the serious neurological disorders may be obtained from occupational epidemiology.",

      "title": "Neurocognitive impairment after critical illness",
      "abstract": "Abstract More than 5 million individuals are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in North America annually. Due to improvements in treatment, increasing numbers of these individuals survive and go on to develop long-term neurocognitive impairment in a variety of cognitive domains. As evidence from over two dozen studies demonstrates, neurocognitive impairment occurs in up to two-thirds of individuals. While it may be particularly common in those with pre-existing vulnerabilities, even patients who are young with robust health prior to critical illness are at risk of post-ICU neurocognitive impairment. While neurocognitive impairment may improve over time and even dissipate in a subset of ICU survivors, neurocognitive impairment is often permanent and, in some cases may be progressive. As commonly occurs in the context of acquired brain injury, the neurocognitive impairment observed after critical illness is typically diffuse, although domains including memory, attention, and executive functioning are often particularly impaired. This impairment is sufficiently severe to negatively impact daily functioning. Although the risk factors and mechanisms undergirding neurocognitive impairment have yet to be fully elucidated, potential contributors include inflammation, hypoxia, and delirium. While one way to impact on the prevalence and incidence of cognitive impairment after critical illness is to attempt to modify key ‘in-hospital’ risk factors, another approach involves the use of post-ICU cognitive rehabilitation, which is increasingly being successfully employed with other impaired medical populations.",

      "abstract": "Substance abuse complicates pain management. The comorbidity of substance abuse and pain is particularly problematic in the United States and Canada, substantially more than in most countries with advanced health care systems. Treatment of pain with long-term opioids, particularly in high doses, is known to be associated with substantial medical comorbidity, unintentional overdoses, and death. Treatment of opioid dependence in the chronic pain patient is necessary for effective pain management, whether or not the patient uses drugs illicitly. Opioids, particularly in high doses, produce central nervous system neuroadaptations that reduce or eliminate analgesic effectiveness and enhance sensitivity to pain in general. The neuroadaptations often result in opioid dependency and, in the long-term, craving. Weaning patients from chronic opioids can be exquisitely difficult if simple dose reduction is attempted. The process can be quite successful and gratifying, however, if certain principles are followed. These include education, comfortable detoxification using long-acting opioids, usually methadone or buprenorphine, nonopioid pain management, psychological support, and coordinated care.",

      "title": "Evidence Against Permanent Neurologic Damage From Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is much more common than is generally appreciated and is certainly underdiagnosed, but its long-term effects are largely undetermined and remain controversial. There is increasing experimental evidence that generalized convulsive status epilepticus produces lasting neuropathologic damage in the hippocampus, but experimental models often include provocation of status epilepticus (SE) by physical (e.g., electrical stimulation) and chemical (including excitotoxic) agents that may induce damage independent of the epileptiform discharges. Also, damage appears to be related to the intensity and duration of electrical stimulation. Such models usually include high-frequency discharges sustained over long periods, somewhat different from the electrical activity of typical human NCSE. Pathologic studies in humans pertain primarily to patients who have had generalized convulsive status epilepticus. Clinical studies of the effects of NCSE are mandatory, but conclusions are difficult to come by, in part because of diverse definitions of NCSE. An altered mental status is obligatory, but the pertinent EEG and medication response criteria are controversial. Response to medication can be delayed by many hours or even days. Absence SE appears to cause no lasting effects. Complex partial SE is less uniform. Most reported cases have returned to baseline neurologic function, but several well-described patients have had prolonged memory deficits. The significance of other deficits is difficult to interpret in light of concomitant vascular and other diseases causing neurologic dysfunction. Clinical series usually lack premorbid neurologic and neuropsychologic assessment. The few exceptions are complicated by preexisting mental retardation and other deficits, by the coexistence of progressive illness, by the later effects of recurrent seizures, and almost always by the confounding influence of anticonvulsant medications. Most morbidity appears attributable to the underlying illnesses rather than to the NCSE itself. It is possible that relatively infrequent cases of prolonged NCSE or those with the synergistic effect of concomitant systemic illness, focal lesions, or very rapid excitatory epileptiform discharges may suffer more long-lasting damage, but these observations are still preliminary. NCSE should be treated expeditiously because of the acute neurologic impairment of the patients, because of the attendant morbidity including physical injury, and because it may go on to generalized convulsions. There is reasonable concern about possible long-term effects, but permanent neurologic damage from NCSE has not yet been established as a mandate for urgent treatment.",

      "abstract": "The Malignant Neuroleptic Syndrome (MNS) is characterised by the acute appearance of hyperthermia, muscular rigidity, loss of motor control, and alterations in the level of consciousness, which could prove fatal if not rapidly diagnosed and treated. It is held to be a serious idiosyncratic reaction which appears in patients being treated with neuroleptics, independently of the dosage and the length of time the drug has been prescribed. Relapses do not usually occur when the drug is re-prescribed, once the acute phase has been passed, which suggests the existence of predisposing factors. There are frequent complications (acute respiration difficulties, acute kidney failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorganic failure) which condition the prognosis. The treatment consists of the suppression of the neuroleptic, rehydration, and specific drugs (bromocryptine, sodium dantroline). We have analysed two new cases which reacted badly, one of them with a multiorganic failure and the other, who had a good initial therapeutical response but who went on to develop a peripheral neuropathy, an infrequent complication in international medical casebooks.",

The hallucinations may persist for a long time, due to which the clinical picture can be mistaken for a disorder on the schizophrenia spectrum. The prognosis tends to be favourable, although untreated cases are associated with a considerable mortality risk (37% in eight years).A 38-year-old male was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with hallucinations of acute onset during alcohol abuse which persisted for two months of abstinence. The patient experienced visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations during which time his consciousness, attention, orientation and higher cognitive functions remained intact. Somatic and neuroimaging investigations showed no abnormalities. The patient partially recovered on treatment with haloperidol.If hallucinations are experienced during or after a period of alcohol abuse, the diagnosis of alcohol hallucinosis should be considered. The diagnosis must be distinguished from delirium tremens and schizophrenia spectrum disorder as treatment and prognosis are essentially different.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) that persists for 1 year or more following withdrawal of neuroleptics is usually said to be permanent. Early spontaneous remissions have been well described but most such remissions occurred within the first few months following neuroleptic withdrawal, and no published studies have followed patients for more than 2 years to evaluate permanence of remission. Over the last 12 years, we studied six patients with TD who, on prolonged follow-up, were found to have complete remission of their abnormal movements after a neuroleptic-free period of more than 2 years (2-5 years). All six patients were 61 years old or younger when their TD was diagnosed and their neuroleptics withdrawn. In five of the patients, remission occurred while the patients were not taking medication for the movements, while one patient had been on long-term, high-dose (2 mg/day) reserpine therapy for more than 3 years. The incidence of late remission of TD is not known and cannot be estimated from these selected patients, but these cases demonstrate that persistence of abnormal movements of TD for 2 or more years following neuroleptic withdrawal does not imply permanence in all patients. We suggest that TD be considered a persistent rather than an invariably permanent disorder.",

The studies that are available have significant methodologic problems, including the mixing of early- and late-onset patients, inadequate outcome criteria, and the lack of control groups. Studies of conventional neuroleptics suggest that older patients have a moderate therapeutic response but are likely to develop side effects. The few studies of atypical antipsychotics now available suggest efficacy for treatment of behavioral disturbance in the elderly and a more favorable side-effect profile. The usefulness of all neuroleptics for the treatment of the core symptoms of late-life schizophrenia may depend on the duration and severity of the symptoms, with a poor response associated with greater severity and duration. It appears that patients with later-onset symptoms may respond better to all neuroleptics.",

      "abstract": "Compliance is generally defined as the extent to which a patient adheres to a treatment regimen and, specifically, takes medication as prescribed. While little research is available about the number of patients who consistently skip antidepressant doses, the literature indicates that about 30% of patients discontinue treatment suddenly within the first month. Both missed doses and abrupt stoppage of treatment place a patient at risk for experiencing discontinuation symptoms. A variety of reasons ranging from forgetfulness to lack of knowledge about the importance of taking every dose may lead to nonadherence to an antidepressant regimen. By spending time on patient education, providing reasons why patients should take every antidepressant dose, discussing alternative treatments, and conveying empathy, support for, and understanding of the patient, physicians may be able to minimize noncompliance and consequently decrease the likelihood that a patient may experience discontinuation symptoms. Discontinuation of an antidepressant can cause a patient to be irritable, experience severe dizziness, or act emotionally absent, which may have a sustained adverse impact both on job performance and on family and social relationships.",

Unlike the benign addiction, by conditioning, drugs addiction initiates very fast (after 1 or 2 intakes), had a big resistance at treatment and show the phenomena of sever disturbance in withdrawal. In this paper we refer mainly at this kind of dependency. Nervous disturbances that are produced during drugs and even alcohol intakes refer to psychical affective and cognitive processes.

      "abstract": "Occasional trouble sleeping is part of the human condition, but persistent insomnia is not. Pharmacotherapy is the most common treatment for insomnia. Benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, and melatonin receptor agonists are among the most studied compounds for the treatment of insomnia. These compounds differ in their sites of action in the brain, their half-lives, and their durations of action. These differences allow clinicians to make therapeutic choices based on the specific sleep needs of individual patients. For example, medications with a rapid onset of action and a short half-life are likely to be effective for sleep initiation but unlikely to improve sleep maintenance. A compound with a longer half-life would be expected to sustain sleep on a more extended basis but could lead to residual sedation. A (theoretically) ideal compound for promoting and sustaining sleep over a desired period of time would be one with an immediate onset of action, a sustained effect for the desired duration of effect, and rapid reduction in effect after this period of time. The benzodiazepines tend to have longer half-lives than the nonbenzodiazepines but carry a greater risk for residual sedation. The melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon has a short half-life and is not indicated for sleep maintenance.",

The condition has been reported in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics treated with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents who typically have a history of poor glycaemic control. Pathogenesis of the condition and its associated pain is poorly understood, with proposed mechanisms including endoneurial ischaemia, hypoglycaemic microvascular neuronal damage and regenerating nerve firing. Pain can affect other areas including the trunk and abdomen, or be more generalised. “Diabetic neuropathic cachexia” is a rare disorder associated with poor diabetic control that presents with large amounts of unintentional weight loss associated with an acute symmetrical painful peripheral neuropathy without weakness. Pain is characteristically burning in nature with predominant lower limb involvement and allodynia. The disorder can also affect type 1 and type 2 diabetics and occur irrespective of the duration of their diabetes. Depression and in males, impotence, appear to be common, although other autonomic features can be present. Typically it has a monophasic course but has been reported to be recurrent. As with insulin neuritis, this condition is reversible over weeks to months after adequate diabetic control. For both disorders, the pain can be treatment resistant despite the use of multiple analgesics. Keywords: Cachexia, diabetes, insulin, neuropathy, neuritis, treatment",

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

      "title": "A Comprehensive Review on the Screening Models for the Pharmacological Assessment of Antipsychotic Drugs",
      "abstract": "Background: Psychosis is a debilitating mental disorder characterized by a profound disconnection from reality, manifesting in symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. The pathophysiology of psychosis is multifaceted, involving an interplay of neurobiological, genetic, and environmental factors. Neurobiologically, dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems particularly dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic pathways-plays a central role, with excessive dopaminergic activity linked to positive symptoms and glutamatergic dysfunction implicated in cognitive impairments. Genetic predisposition, evidenced by significant heritability and associations with specific genetic variants, intersects with environmental factors such as stress, trauma, and substance use to influence the onset and progression of psychosis. Cognitive disruptions, including deficits in attention, memory, and executive function, exacerbate the disorder’s impact. This phenomenon has led to short-term as well as long-term psychosocial and mental health implications for all. Objective: To determine the antipsychotic activity of pharmaceuticals, numerous antipsychotic screening models are available. Determining the optimal animal model for measuring antipsychotic activity is the primary goal of this study. Methods: A search for literature was carried out using several keywords, including \"Antipsychotic,\" \"In-vivo models,\" \"In-vitro models,\" and \"Behavior models,\" on the databases Science Direct and PubMed. For the purpose of obtaining the most appropriate articles to fulfil the goal of this review article, the search was customized by using the necessary filters. Results: Research and review articles based on neuroleptic screening models are available to determine the antipsychotic activity of novel pharmacological compounds. Conclusion: Following our research, we identified several helpful models for evaluating the antipsychotic activity of pharmaceuticals and proposed that combining invitro and in-vivo techniques with behavioral methodologies might yield the most appropriate results for our field of study.",

      "abstract": "Conversion disorder is the clinical situation in which one or more symptoms can present deficits that affect motor or sensory function and suggest a neurological or organic condition. Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

      "abstract": "Neurological outcome after preterm birth refers to neurologically defined conditions due to disorders of the motor system – e.g. spasticity, dyskinesia or ataxia – which are commonly summarized under the term “cerebral palsy” (CP). Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW. This means that CP following preterm birth, or brain compromise affecting the motor system, is probably related to a pathomechanism specifically affecting the immature brain, which stresses the importance of gaining insight into the following questions:",

      "title": "Mechanistic basis of adverse drugreactions: the perils of inappropriate dose schedules",
      "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have long been recognised as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. They account for a substantial number of clinical consultations, hospital admissions and extended duration of in-patient stay as well as mortality. By far the most common ADRs are the concentration-dependent pharmacological reactions, the majority of which ought to be preventable. As a result of high concentrations of the parent drug and/or its metabolite(s), there is an augmentation of primary pharmacological activity and/or appearance of new and undesirable secondary pharmacological activity. Typically, these high concentrations result from administration of high doses in an attempt to maximise efficacy and/or modulation of the pharmacokinetics of a drug by either genetic or non-genetic factors. High plasma concentrations of parent drug may result from inherited impairment or drug-induced inhibition of its pharmacokinetic disposition. Conversely, inherited overcapacity or drug-induced induction of the metabolism of a drug may result in low concentrations of parent drug and frequently, rapid accumulation of its metabolites. Environmental, dietary and phytochemical factors may also influence the activity of drug metabolising enzymes. As with inherited polymorphisms of acetylation and cytochrome P450-based drug metabolising enzymes, polymorphisms of other conjugation reactions, such as glucuronidation, increasingly appear to be associated with drug toxicity. Diseases of organs involved in elimination of a drug also alter its pharmacokinetics, plasma concentration and, therefore, the profile of its concentration-dependent ADRs. Inherited mutations, concurrently administered drugs or presence of certain diseases may also alter the sensitivity of some pharmacological targets, accounting for a substantial number of ADRs and interactions. When there is enhanced pharmacodynamic sensitivity, plasma drug concentrations that are apparently within the normal 'non-toxic' range give rise to ADRs. Recent advances have also provided important insights into the wider scope of drug–drug interactions. Interactions that occur at P-glycoproteins, drug transporters and efflux pumps, at various transmembrane interfaces such as the gastrointestinal wall, renal tubules, hepatobiliary border and blood–brain barrier, are beginning to explain many non-metabolic interactions. These alter the systemic exposure to drugs and have so far, begun to explain unexpected neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. The function of these transporters is also genetically modulated. These advances, together with continued increased awareness and education of prescribers and pharmacists, offer great opportunities for substantially minimising concentration-related ADRs.",

Because there are no specific laboratory tests, however, its diagnosis relies exclusively on clinical criteria. The presence of dementia should be suspected whenever mental changes of insidious onset emerge without sufficient situational stress and gradually interfere with the daily living activities that are appropriate for age and background. Dementia can be reversible or irreversible, precipitously progressive or indolent, bristling with multiple cognitive deficits, or characterized almost exclusively by disturbances of affect, motivation, and personality. When the behavioral changes are dramatic and interfere with active careers in younger individuals, early diagnosis poses little difficulty. The real challenge arises among the elderly, in whom dementia is also far more common. This is because the elderly tend to have less demanding daily activities, the disruption of which may take longer to detect, and also because",

These patients present with a combination of severe symptoms and long-term illness, and may experience serious chronic physical sequelae (e.g. osteoporosis and renal failure), marked social isolation and stigma. Their carers suffer from the stress of caring for them over a prolonged period. Symptoms, treatment and crisis management of SEED-AN are discussed. SEED is a relatively recently described area of eating disorders psychiatry that requires research and service development so that patients and carers are helped to cope with very serious chronic, but not incurable, conditions.

      "abstract": "APRESENTACAO: A esquizofrenia e uma doenca cronica, incapacitante, que afeta mais de 21 milhoes de pessoas em todo o mundo. E concebida, na atualidade, como um transtorno mental persistente e complexo, caracterizado por um conjunto de sinais e sintomas que incluem discurso e comportamento desorganizados, delirios, alucinacoes e alteracao na cognicao. O tratamento baseia-se, essencialmente, no uso de medicamentos denominados antipsicoticos, associados a terapias psicossociais. Cerca de 30% das pessoas que possuem esquizofrenia nao apresentam melhora do quadro clinico, sendo denominadas refratarias ou resistentes ao tratamento. Os diferentes mecanismos fisiopatologicos desse transtorno podem estar envolvidos em sua etiologia. Apesar de nao existir um consenso unico e globalmente aceito, a esquizofrenia refrataria pode ser caracterizada quando nao ha melhora dos principais sintomas apos o tratamento com dois antipsicoticos de classes diferentes (sendo pelo menos um atipico), em doses adequadas, durante um determinado periodo de tempo (4-6 ou 6-8 semanas). O tratamento medicamentoso de escolha, para os casos de esquizofrenia resistente (ou refrataria), e a prescricao do antipsicotico atipico clozapina. Ja a Sindrome metabolica (SM) caracteriza-se por um conjunto de fatores de risco para diabetes mellitus do tipo 2 e doencas cardiovasculares, tendo como componentes centrais a obesidade abdominal, resistencia a insulina, dislipidemia e hipertensao. Alem disso, tambem esta associada ao desenvolvimento de doencas hepaticas, respiratorias, osteoarticulares e câncer. Em pacientes com esquizofrenia, estima-se que, aproximadamente, 34% das mortes entre pessoas do sexo masculino e 31% naquelas do sexo feminino sejam atribuidas a doenca cardiovascular, o que so e superado pelo suicidio. Desta forma, apresenta-se como uma condicao complexa que acarreta alto custo social e economico para os sistemas de saude e familias, atingindo todas as populacoes do mundo. Pessoas que possuem esquizofrenia apresentam um risco aumentado para alteracoes metabolicas, em comparacao ao da populacao geral. Este artigo foi elaborado com o objetivo de estimar a prevalencia de sindrome metabolica (SM) e os fatores associados, segundo as variaveis sociodemograficas, clinicas e comportamentais em pacientes com esquizofrenia refrataria em uso de clozapina. METODOLOGIA: Foi realizado um estudo de delineamento transversal na Regiao Ampliada Oeste do Estado de Minas Gerais (MG). A populacao foi composta por 169 pessoas que constavam no cadastro da Superintendencia Regional de Saude (SRS) dessa regiao, com diagnostico medico de esquizofrenia refrataria que estavam em uso do antipsicotico atipico clozapina, maiores de 18 anos, de ambos os sexos e com capacidade de entendimento. O calculo amostral foi realizado, utilizando-se o programa OpenEpi, versao 3.03a, considerando-se uma populacao de 169 individuos para uma proporcao esperada do evento de 50%, um nivel de significância de 5% e margem de erro de 10%, estimando-se uma amostra de, aproximadamente, 62 individuos. A amostra final foi composta por todos os pacientes que compareceram ao CAPS de Divinopolis, durante o periodo de coleta de dados (dezembro de 2014 a junho de 2015), totalizando-se 72 individuos. Foram excluidas do estudo as mulheres gravidas, os participantes que nao estavam em jejum e aqueles que apresentaram qualquer condicao que pudesse interferir na coleta e mensuracao dos dados. O projeto foi aprovado pelo Comite de Etica em Pesquisa com Seres Humanos da Universidade Federal de Sao Joao Del-Rei, Campus Centro-Oeste Dona Lindu (UFSJ/CCO) sob o parecer 572.288. Foram coletados dados sociodemograficos, clinicos, antropometricos e bioquimicos. O processamento e a analise dos dados foram realizados por meio do programa Statistical Package for the Social Science®, versao 20.0. As variaveis foram descritas por meio de suas frequencias absolutas e relativas. Para a comparacao dos pacientes com e sem sindrome metabolica, foram utilizados os testes de Qui-Quadrado de Pearson e exato de Fischer. Na analise multivariada, para avaliar os fatores associados a SM, foi utilizado o modelo de regressao logistica binaria. Para a entrada das variaveis preditoras no modelo, foi considerado um valor-p menor que 0,20 na analise univariada. Utilizou-se o criterio forward para a entrada das variaveis no modelo e para a permanencia delas no modelo final foi adotado um nivel de 5% de significância. Apos ajuste do modelo final, foi avaliada a estimativa do OddsRatio ajustado com o respectivo intervalo de confianca de 95% (IC 95%). O ajuste do modelo foi avaliado por meio da estatistica de Hosmer& Lemeshow. Observou-se prevalencia de SM em 47,2% da amostra, com predominio entre as mulheres (58,8%). Pacientes com a sindrome apresentaram percentuais mais elevados de alteracoes, em todos os componentes. As razoes para essa elevada prevalencia ainda e muito controversa, principalmente em funcao da possivel participacao dos medicamentos antipsicoticos na genese das anormalidades metabolicas. A esquizofrenia, por si so, ja representa um fator de risco para as anormalidades que compoem a SM e, neste contexto, as medicacoes atipicas ou de segunda-geracao, estando entre elas a clozapina, possuem um papel importante na potencializacao do risco. A relacao precisa entre o uso de medicacoes antipsicoticas e o desenvolvimento de SM ainda permanece incerta, podendo-se afirmar, com clareza, que pessoas tratadas com esses medicamentos apresentam SM em uma frequencia superior a da populacao geral. A prevalencia de SM gira em torno de 4 a 26% nas pessoas que nao fazem uso desses medicamentos, chegando a 69% naqueles medicados. O uso de quatro ou mais medicamentos, sobrepeso e obesidade indicaram associacao significativa. Observa-se que a ingesta de varios medicamentos aumenta o risco para o aparecimento de efeitos adversos metabolicos, contribuindo, por conseguinte, para o desenvolvimento de SM. Um estudo que analisou o uso de mais de um psicotropico (politerapia), em comparacao a monoterapia, confirmou um risco aumentado para o desenvolvimento de alteracoes metabolicas e outras comorbidades. Deste modo, este achado deve ser visto com cuidado, considerando-se que pacientes que possuem esquizofrenia refrataria tendem a utilizar um numero maior de medicamentos em detrimento da gravidade da doenca e de sintomas diversos. Somando-se a isso, uma relacao causal mostra-se inviavel de ser estabelecida, tendo em vista a natureza deste estudo. Pacientes com a sindrome apresentaram um historico de menos internacoes psiquiatricas, comparados aqueles que nao a possuem , sendo associado a SM na analise multivariada. A prevalencia de SM foi elevada, considerando-se que esta taxa representa um valioso indicador de saude e aponta para a necessidade de cuidado e atencao. Sugere-se que esses pacientes sejam continuamente monitorados clinicamente, tanto no inicio do tratamento com clozapina quanto no seu decorrer, por meio de avaliacoes frequentes de seu peso, circunferencia da cintura e pressao arterial, bem como realizacao de exames bioquimicos quanto aos componentes de SM. Alem disso, indica-se que eles sejam incluidos em grupos e outras estrategias de educacao em saude e de qualidade de vida nas unidades de saude. Para isso, e necessario que esse grupo de pacientes seja visto como prioritario pelos gestores e profissionais de saude, considerando-se a necessidade de vigilância continua desses fatores de risco para o estabelecimento de intervencoes precoces e efetivas.",

      "title": "THE MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT RESISTANCE IN DEPRESSED PATIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "In the general population, presence of a mood disorder increases the odds of a substance use disorder.71 Substance use and abuse is common in psychiatric patients, and depressive syndromes are common in patients seeking treatment for substance abuse.1, 89 Aside from their common co-occurrence, there are at least three sets of reasons to focus on clinically when treating the combination of substance use and depression: Substances, through their acute and chronic effects, may worsen depression and contribute to treatment resistance. DSM-IV lists either substance-induced mood, anxiety, or sleep disorders as resulting from practically every class of addictive substances.2 Thus, substance use could either worsen or account entirely for a treatment-resistant depressive syndrome. Depression may worsen the severity of substance use, increasing its deleterious effects over time. It has been shown consistently that patients with both depression and substance use syndromes have a poorer prognosis along various domains of outcome. * In particular the combination of depression and substance abuse increases the risk of suicide.42, 51 Substance use disorder in a depressive patient may point the way to other, previously unappreciated psychopathologic conditions that may contribute to treatment resistance. In the general population, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders are more strongly associated with substance abuse than is depression.71 These have specific treatment indications, mood stabilizers and various nonbenzodiazepine antianxiety regimens, 55 which might improve outcome in previously treatment-resistant cases. For example, buspirone has been shown to improve outcome in alcoholics with generalized anxiety symptoms.40 Explosive irritable mood in substance abusers may benefit from mood stabilizers, even in the absence of clear-cut bipolar disorder.21, 22 Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is a well-established risk factor for substance abuse and also is associated with depression.9, 10, 11, 24, 35 Such patients might benefit from antidepressant agents with demonstrated efficacy against ADD, such as desipramine or bupropion.4, 8, 12 Alcohol and other substances may cause dementia syndromes with associated mood symptoms, 34 which would suggest further neurologic and medical evaluation. The development of recommendations for treatment-resistant depression in patients with substance abuse or dependence is complicated by three issues: (1) Two domains of outcome are involved—substance use symptoms and mood symptoms; (2) Diagnostic uncertainty surrounds depressive symptoms in the setting of ongoing substance use; and (3) There is a relative lack of empiric studies on treatment of depression in substance abusers. An empiric base is beginning to accumulate on the initial treatment of depression in substance abusers, and this is reviewed in this article. There are no systematic studies to date on treatment-resistant depression in these patients. Illustrative cases are presented from the authors' clinical experience that suggest general principles and directions for future research.",

      "abstract": "We previously reported a case of delayed autonomic neuropathy in a patient with diethylene glycol (DEG) poisoning,1 and would like to emphasize two characteristic complications, sensorimotor neuropathy and renal failure, occurring in the same case, because of their severity and possible reversibility. Although once recovered from acute symptoms by day 3, the patient suffered from long-term ventilator dependence (days 11–54), unresponsiveness, and quadriparesis. Despite no remarkable finding on brain magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, or lumber puncture, a nerve conduction study showed reductions in the amplitudes and conduction velocities of compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials in the limbs (Table 1). The patient recovered from all neurological symptoms within 2 years of exposure to DEG. Sensorimotor neuropathy from DEG poisoning can be delayed until at least 5–10 days post-ingestion and presents various symptoms including quadriparesis and unresponsiveness.2 The clinical course in severe cases is unpredictable, with long-term resolution in some patients and permanent neurological damage in others.2 In the management of such patients, subsequent close observation is required even after initial recovery. The patient received renal replacement therapy (RRT) for renal failure on day 1–30. Although RRT could be withdrawn in this case, one report showed 90.0% of dialysis-dependent patients from DEG poisoning remained so over time.3 Clinicians should recognize a possible necessity of long-term RRT for such cases. The report of this case was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine (2015-1-668). Conflict of Interest: None declared.",

      "title": "Clinical, methodological and theoretical issues in the assessment of cognition after anaesthesia and surgery",
      "abstract": "As people live longer, the burden of cognitive impairment to elderly patients, their families and society becomes increasingly common and important. The loss of independence, a reduction in the quality of life and increased mortality are possible correlates to the mental disintegration. Cognitive dysfunction following major surgery on the elderly is a significant problem which adds to other cognitive impairments caused by neurodegeneration, cerebrovascular impairments and other causes. There are challenges in reviewing the literature because of many methodological concerns. There is no standard definition; the diagnosis is made only by the results of neuropsychological tests which are not standardised for this purpose; test results are analysed by different statistical methods (some of them inappropriate); controls are often absent or poorly matched; and pre-existing mild cognitive impairment, which affects 10 to 20% of people older than 65 years and is similar to the subtle cognitive impairment following surgery, is not sought for and recognised. Reviews of the subject have varied from descriptions such as ‘a well recognised and significant problem’ to ‘a hypothetical phenomenon for which there is no International Statistical Classification of Disease (ICD-9) code, and no Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) code’. This article examines both sides of the spectrum in a detailed review which explains the necessary psychological ‘jargon’, discusses the methods used and points to areas of future research.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Aspects of Brain Injury in Childhood: A Review",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Children suffering with brain injury or epilepsy run an appreciably increased risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. The reasons for this are not clear, however. There have been few relevant follow‐up or treatment studies and it is still not known whether the associated presence of brain injury or epilepsy influences the natural history or treatability of a given type of psychiatric disorder. Abnormalities of gestational length, complications of delivery or infection of the nervous system do not appear to increase the risk of psychiatric disorder unless followed by manifest signs of brain injury. Children with structural damage and fits, and children with temporal lobe epilepsy seem to be those who are most likely to develop a behaviour disturbance. Brain‐damaged children may suffer from any type of psychiatric condition. There is no particular disorder that occurs with disproportionate frequency in the neuro‐epileptic population, and by implication there do not seem to be any specific behavioural syndromes which are themselves pathognomonic of central nervous system damage or dysfunction. RÉSUMÉ Aspects psychiatriques des lésions cérébrales dans l'enfance Les enfants souffrant d'une lésion cérébrale ou d'une épilepsie ont un risque nettement accru de présenter un trouble psychiatrique. Les raisons n'en sont cependant pas très claires. Peu d'études longitudinales ou thérapeutiques ont été entreprises et il n'est toujours pas établi que la présence associée d'un traumatisme cérébral ou d'une épilepsie marque l'histoire naturelle ou la curabilité d'un type donné de trouble psychiatrique. Les anomalies du temps de gestation, les complications de l'accouchement ou les infections du système nerveux ne semblent pas accroitre le risque de troubles psychiatriques s'il n'y a pas eu de signes manifestes de lésion cérébrale. Les enfants présentant des troubles structurés ou des crises et les enfants avec épilepsie du lobe temporal sont ceux qui ont le plus de chances de développer un trouble du comportement. Une lésion cérébrale chez l'enfant peut évoluer vers n'importe quel type de condition psychiatrique. II n'y a pas de désordres particuliers survenant avec une fréquence disproportionnée dans une population neuroépileptique; par voie de conséquences, il ne semble y avoir aucun syndrome comportemental spécifique qui soit pathognomonique d'un dommage ou d'une dysfonction du système nerveux central. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Psychiatrische Aspekte der Hirnverletzungen im Kindesalter Kinder, die an einer Hirnverletzung oder einer Epilepsie leiden, haben ein bedeutend höheres Risiko eine psychische Störung zu entwickeln. Die Gründe dafür sind jedoch nicht ganz klar. Es sind nur wenig relevante Langzeit‐ oder Behandlungsstudien gemacht worden und es ist noch nicht bekannt, ob eine Hirnverletzung oder Epilepsie den normalen Verlauf einer bestimmten psychischen Erkrankung, oder die Ansprechbarkeit auf die Therapie beeinflussen. Abnorme Gestationsperioden, Komplikationen bei der Geburt oder Infektionen des Nervensystems scheinen das Risiko für die Entstehung einer psychischen Erkrankung nicht zu erhöhen, es sei denn es treten danach deutliche Zeichen eines Hirnschadens auf. Kinder mit Fehlbildungen, Krämpfen und Temporallappenepilepsie entwickeln offenbar am ehesten Verhaltensstörungen. Hirngeschädigte Kinder können jegliche Art eines psychiatrischen Zustandbildes bieten. Es gibt keine spezielle Erkrankung, die mit übermäßiger Häufigkeit bei dem neuro‐epilepti‐schen Krankengut vorkommt und damit scheint es keine spezifischen Verhaltenssyndrome zu geben, die selbst pathognomonisch für eine Schädigung oder Dysfunktion des Zentralnervensystems sind. RESUMEN Aspectos psiquiàtricos de la lesión cerebral en la infancia Los niños que sufren de lesión cerebral o de epilepsia corren un riesgo apreciablemente aumentado de padecer una alteración psiquiátrica. Sin embargo las razones de ello no están claras. Se han realizado pocos estudios seriados o estudios de tratamiento y todavía no se sabe si la presencia asociada de una lesión cerebral o de epilepsia influencia la evolución o la posibilidad de tratamiento de un determinado tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. Las anomalías en la duración gestacional, complicaciones del parto o infección del sistema nervioso, no parece que aumenten el riesgo de una alteración psiquiátrica, salvo que vayan seguidos de signos manifiestos de lesión cerebral. Los niños con alteración estructural y convulsiones y niños con epilepsia del lóbulo temporal parece que son los que tienen más tendencia a desarrollar una alteración en el comportamiento. Los niños con lesión cerebral pueden sufrir cualquier tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. No hay ninguna alteración en particular que aparezca en la población neuro‐epiléptica con una frecuencia desproporcionada y por implicación no parece que haya ningún síndrome especifico del comportamiento que sea por sí mismo patogmónico de una lesión o disfunción del sistema nervioso central.",

      "title": "Are we compulsively chasing rainbows?",
      "abstract": "Addiction is commonly defined as a chronic, relapsing disorder characterized by taking drugs in excess, compulsive drug seeking, and continued use despite harmful consequences (NIDA, SAMSHA) despite the fact that the word \"compulsive\" is not explicitly stated in the DSM-or ICD-based diagnostic classification of substance use disorders (SUD), and that the role of compulsivity in addiction remains highly debated [1].Similarly, in the preclinical addiction field, the idea that the only way to identify an individual with addictionlike behaviors is to measure compulsive drug use/drug seeking is pervasive and often treated as the only approach for studying neuropharmacological mechanisms relevant to addiction.Recently, the addiction neuroscience field has moved from recognizing that \"compulsive drug seeking/use\" and \"continued seeking/use despite negative consequences\" are two distinct aspects of addiction to defining the former nearly exclusively by the latter [2-7].In our opinion, this informal but pervasive re-definition of compulsion has sacrificed construct validity for operationalization, and a direct consequence of this re-definition is that continued drug use (or seeking) despite punishment (e.g., painful footshock or bitter tastants) is widely considered the behavioral hallmark for compulsive-like drug-seeking behavior in preclinical models.We believe that over-reliance of addiction neuroscientists (including ourselves) on this measure hinges more on experimental convenience (i.e., testability) than on construct validity, and we also believe that over-reliance on this approach may be detrimental to the field.Here, we highlight several issues associated with the definition of compulsivity in addiction, problems associated with the regard for compulsivity as the defining feature of addiction, and the existence of conceptual and methodological limitations in preclinical studies.We also suggest ways for the field to move forward from the current position.Note that 'drug' in this commentary is a generic term that refers to alcohol, nicotine, and tobacco products, and illicit drugs.",

It occurs as a consequence of brain damage localized in various cortical and/or subcortical structures, but mainly in parietotemporal areas of the right hemisphere. Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation. There are many different standardised and clinical assessment procedures of hemineglect. Clinical and functional tasks should be analysed along with behavioural observation in natural situations as well as interview data. Differential diagnostics is critical for planning an effective rehabilitation programme.",

      "abstract": "There is little written in the geriatric literature about the concept of psychological frailty which encompasses cognitive, mood, and motivational components. The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

      "title": "A “Prosthetic” Approach for Individuals With Dementia?",
      "abstract": "AN UNRESOLVED ISSUE IN DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE AND specific care for individuals with severe dementia is focusing on the main outcome of the caring process from which the approach, the indicators of quality, and the results heavily depend. Severe dementia still lacks effective pharmacological treatment, such that drugs to treat symptoms only modify the curve of declining cognitive function or help somewhat in attenuating the intensity and frequency of noncognitive symptoms. Thus, most problems that affect patients and cause stress for caregivers have not been solved. The “clinical” goal of making the diagnosis and providing therapy for patients with dementia is a necessary but not sufficient approach. Such a model is not only limited by the absence of a therapeutic cure, but some of the most troubling problems do not end but rather begin after the diagnosis is made. For instance, attempts to eradicate symptoms have led to the wide use of psychotropic drugs that are potentially harmful and not of definite benefit for patients with dementia. As a consequence, nonpharmacologic approaches for maintaining cognitive function by providing an adequate amount of cognitive stimulation are gaining more attention and relevance. Attempts to rehabilitate individuals with dementia are usually performed through standard training methods such as cognitive stimulation and development of a reorienting environment. However, these attempts to stimulate cognitive functions usually fail or fall short because of the degree of memory loss and cognitive impairment among individuals with moderate to severe dementia. Hence, most stimulating interventions can be cautiously applied only in the first stages of the dementing disease process, although the results of studies evaluating these interventions are limited in effect size and duration. However, because patients with dementia, mainly Alzheimer disease, spend most of their care-needing time in the moderate to severe and late stages of the disease, it is crucial to define a goal, and consequently a quality approach that also might prove effective for these stages. A potentially useful “prosthetic” model for dementia involves applying the principles of a model first developed by Jones. An individual with degenerative advanced impairment of the brain, such as severe Alzheimer disease, whose brain is reduced in size and number of neurons and synapses, needs external support for maintaining at least some cognitive function. The key theoretical concept is that individuals with dementia can obtain from external sources what they cannot from inside. The usual definition of prosthesis (“artificial part supplied to replace a missing body part”) is limiting, because physicians use several prosthetic interventions in their practice that do not necessarily replace a structural part of the body, such as the use of insulin for individuals with diabetes. The prosthetic model for dementia identifies deficits in function in the patient and builds a “prosthesis of care” for each individual that is intended to compensate for the lost function(s). The main goal of the prosthesis is not to regain cognition or function, but to deal with the well-being of the person, to achieve the best status in absence of distress and pain. To potentially help brain function, a complex prosthesis is needed, made up of 3 basic elements: the individuals with whom the person with dementia interacts, the physical space in which the person lives, and the programs and activities in which the person engages. Most disturbed behaviors and functional impairments can be considered as the expression of an imbalance between the abilities of the individual with dementia and environmental demands, and not merely the expression of the pathology. Therefore, even if it is not possible to enhance the cognitive function of individuals with dementia, it may be possible to reduce their distressing symptoms through a change of the environment, an informed approach by others with whom the individual with dementia interacts, and daily programs. Physical space is recognized to influence the behavior of individuals with dementia and a specially designed envi-",

Risk for relapse increases with continued use because changes to the brain neurocircuitry pathways created by extensive substance use do not completely revert to normal after detoxification or stopping substance use. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is used for addiction to alcohol, opioids, or nicotine and is usually offered in combination with behavioral therapy and/or mutual support program participation. Medications can play a major role in facilitating initial abstinence, reducing relapse risk, and increasing the likelihood of the client maintaining longer periods of abstinence. Behavioral interventions can influence clients to use MAT in their recovery and influence adherence and impact on retention.",

These diseases usually present with a slow onset and a chronic progression. Various regions of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves may be affected, leading to functional impairment and neuron loss. Neurodegenerative diseases are often categorized by symptoms that may include impairment in cognition, movement, strength, coordination, sensation, or autonomic control. However, the diagnosis of a specific neurodegenerative disease may be misleading, as there is both clinical and neuropathologic overlap among diseases and existing diagnostic tools are not always accurate. For most neurodegenerative diseases, neuronal dysfunction, such as synaptic loss, may occur long before neuronal death takes place (Soto, 2003;Shastry, 2003;Aguzzi and O'Connor, 2010).",

Compared with placebo, treatment with imipramine hydrochloride in a multiple crossover design using threeweek treatment periods led to improved performance on the memory task without either clinically apparent improvement in depression or significantly improved performance on the other tasks. These results may reflect the relative complexity of the memory task rather than a specific impairment of short-term memory, but the data do support the presence of cognitive dysfunction in depression, even in ambulatory patients without substantial impairments of attention or motor functioning. The results also indicate that antidepressant drugs can produce improvement in cognitive function, possibly as a forerunner of clinical improvement.",

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychosis in epilepsy may occur in different forms, ranging from brief episodes with a clear temporal relationship to seizures (ictal or postictal psychosis) to symptoms or signs apparently independent of seizures, often manifesting decades after the onset of epilepsy (interictal psychosis). In some patients postictal psychosis develops into interictal psychosis over time. Psychosis may also be observed after epilepsy surgery despite excellent seizure control. The features of psychosis in epilepsy closely resemble those seen in schizophrenia. The prevalence of psychosis is higher in patients with epilepsy compared to the general population; it is less clear whether the prevalence of epilepsy is increased in patients with schizophrenia. Subtle structural brain anomalies have been found in both disorders, and it remains uncertain by what mechanisms schizophrenia and psychosis of epilepsy are related. In terms of treatment, the control of underlying seizure activity is most important in ictal psychosis, for instance psychosis occurring in the context of non-convulsive status epilepticus. Postictal psychosis is usually brief and self-limiting. Treatment is therefore rarely problematic. Short-acting benzodiazepines and neuroleptic drugs are recommended. The treatment of more prolonged interictal psychoses can be challenging and there are no universally accepted neuroleptic treatment regimes.",

Despite extensive study, however, the extent, nature and underlying mechanisms of depression's influence on cognition remain relatively poorly understood. If one views the effects of depression on cognition as falling on a continuum, it is generally evident that individuals with dysthymia or only mild-to-moderate depressive symptomatology, despite their subjective complaints of memory impairment, demonstrate little, if any, objectively verifiable cognitive impairment. At the other extreme of the continuum, major depression can lead to such pervasive cognitive dysfunction, accompanied by impairments in occupational and social functioning, that an individual is diagnosed as having a dementia syndrome.",

Medications that are on the market for the treatment of drug addiction target either the direct reinforcing effects of abuse (eg, naltrexone) or the consequent protracted abstinence syndrome (eg, acamprosate). Both conceptual and neurobiological advances in research have suggested that brain stress systems contribute to the withdrawal/negative affect and preoccupation/anticipation stages of the addiction cycle that promote the compulsivity of drug-taking in addiction. Validated animal models of the stress component of addiction and improved understanding of the neurocircuitry and neuropharmacological mechanisms involved in perturbations of this component suggest that corticotropin-releasing factor systems are a viable target for the development of future medications for drug addiction.",

Alcohol ingestion produced an increase in total hours of sleep which was associated with two distinctive changes in sleep patterns:1) fragmentation , a tendency to sleep in several short episodes (3-4 hours) instead of a sustained night9s sleep; and 2) somnolence , the distribution of consecutive hours of sleep was shifted beyond the base-line mode and long sleep episodes were combined with occasional naps. Fragmentation of sleep patterns was the most reliable correlate of alcohol ingestion and a frequent accompaniment of alcohol withdrawal. However, there were no common sleep distribution patterns during alcohol withdrawal either as a function of symptom severity or type of medication used. Contrary to the prevailing clinical impression, abrupt cessation of drinking did not invariably produce an initial insomnia. Moreover, hallucinosis occurred as a concomitant of the alcohol abstinence syndrome and independent of an antecedent or concurrent state of insomnia. These data are discussed in the context of current models of physical dependence.",

An acute withdrawal syndrome normally regresses in less than one week, but a subacute withdrawal syndrome, which presents as signs of residual hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, must be recognized, as it may persist for several months. Beside delirium tremens, with its mandatory and well-established treatment, prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and treatment of its initial stages raise no problems, as it consists above all of psychotherapy combined by such tranquillizers as febarbamate or a benzodiazepine taken in well-specified dosage.",

Key to understand this dysregulation is recognizing that the problem is not stress per se, but rather its chronicity. The optimally functioning stress system is highly dynamic, and negative feedback regulation enforces transient responses to acute stressors. Chronic stress overrides this, and adaptation to the chronicity can result in persistent dysregulation by altering sensitivity thresholds critical for control of system dynamics. Such adaptation involves plasticity within the central nervous system (CNS) as well as epigenetic regulation. When it occurs during development, it can have persistent effects on neuroendocrine regulation. Understanding how chronic stress programs development of the neuroendocrine stress system requires elucidation of stress-responsive gene regulatory networks that control CNS plasticity and development.",

El grado de deterioro se ha relacionado con la carga lesional y atrofia cerebral en resonancia magnetica , el tiempo de evolucion de la enfermedad, el grado de discapacidad y se ha implicado tanto a sustancia blanca como a sustancia gris . Otros factores que pueden incidir en el rendimiento cognitivo de estos pacientes pueden ser la depresion y la fatiga, sintomas frecuentes en pacientes con EM. La homocisteina es un aminoacido que se sintetiza en el organismo a partir de la metionina, se ha demostrado que su nivel aumentado en plasma es un factor de riesgo independiente de ateroesclerosis y de enfermedad tromboembolica. Su aumento se produce principalmente por alteraciones geneticas en las enzimas encargadas de su produccion o bien por factores dieteticos. En los ultimos anos se ha investigado su posible relacion con el DC en varias enfermedades neurologicas como en la Enfermedad de Alzheimer o en la Enfermedad de Parkinson dado su efecto toxico a nivel de SNC a diferentes niveles de actuacion. En la EM tambien hay hallazgos que encuentran una posible relacion entre hiperhomocisteinemia y mayor grado de DC en estos pacientes. Parece interesante profundizar en dicha linea, dada la importancia del DC y su influencia en la calidad de vida de los pacientes .A partir de los resultados obtenidos en el estudio en las diferentes pruebas aplicadas y del posterior analisis estadistico realizado, podemos concluir: En nuestra muestra no se ha demostrado que pacientes con Esclerosis Multiple y Deterioro Cognitivo asocien niveles elevados de homocisteina. No se ha hallado ningun dominio cognitivo especifico afectado asociado a hiperhomocisteinemia. La fatiga y la depresion no se muestran como factores asociados al Deterioro Cognitivo. El 67 % de los pacientes han presentado Deterioro Cognitivo. Los dominios que se han visto mas afectados han sido la velocidad de procesamiento de informacion y la atencion. El test mas sensible para la deteccion de Deterioro Cognitivo en pacientes con Esclerosis Multiple ha resultado el Symbol Digit Modalities Test. No se han encontrado diferencias en cuanto a presencia de Deterioro Cognitivo entre pacientes con Esclerosis Multiple y Sindrome Clinico Aislado. Se ha asociado el Deterioro Cognitivo a mayor edad, menor nivel de estudios, formas progresivas de la Esclerosis Multiple, mayor tiempo de evolucion de la enfermedad y discapacidad medida por la EDSS.",

      "title": "Benzodiazepines <i>Misuse, Abuse, and Dependence</i>",
      "abstract": "Abstract Inappropriate use of benzodiazepines is an important public health problem. In clinical practice benzodiazepine misuse is generally encountered in one of the three following situations: as part of a complex presentation of polysubstance dependence, in patients who have been prescribed therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and have difficulty stopping use, and rarely, dependence on benzodiazepines as the primary drug of abuse. Determining the extent of the problem is hindered by various definitions of abuse and dependence. In this chapter, we follow the use of previous publications: ‘‘The terms abuse and misuse refer to the use of a drug in a manner that is not consistent with generally accepted medical practice or social and legal custom, e.g., use without a valid prescription or deliberately to produce intoxication, pleasure or a high’’ (Ciraulo and Sarid-Segal, 2005, p. 1300). Misuse is used to describe patients who use higher than prescribed doses, or obtain medications from a friend or relative for therapeutic purposes.",

      "abstract": "Background Clinicians are commonly confronted with the differential diagnosis of altered mental status, impaired cognition and altered level of consciousness in hospitalized patients including those admitted to medical, geriatric, emergency, intensive and post-operative care units. Although delirium is the most common acute neuropsychiatric condition in the acute hospital setting this diagnosis is commonly delayed, made too late or missed altogether. Difficulties and importance of timely diagnosis The causes of delirious states are manifold. Both, direct damage to the brain tissue as well as encephalopathy as a result of other medical diseases, can be the cause of delirium. Depending on the predisposition delirious syndromes can be provoked by minor medical interventions. Clinical presentation is very variable, but remains largely independent of the triggering mechanisms. Purely catatonic, hypoactive, hyperactive and excitatory types as well as mixed forms can be distinguished.Immediate diagnosis of a delirious syndrome and rapid elucidation of its causes are keys for the implementation of curative therapy. There is a need to act fast because delirious phases are associated with significantly longer hospital stay and increased morbidity as a result of long-term cognitive deficits as well as increased mortality. As negative outcome is closely linked to the duration of a delirious episode, early diagnosis and rapid termination of the delirium constitute a significant positive predictor of outcome. In this respect, delirium represents an emergency, with or without concomitant cerebral or extracerebral symptoms.",

      "title": "Disorders of attention: a frontier in neuropsychology",
      "abstract": "There is an extensive behavioural neurological literature on so-called unilateral attentional disorders, but a striking paucity of papers on global disorders of attention, i.e. confusional states. However, confusional states are distinctive because: (1) they are the most common disturbance of the higher functions in clinical practice, by orders of magnitude; (2) they are the only disturbance of the higher functions from which all normal subjects have suffered; (3) they have characteristic clinical manifestations; (4) they are frequently misdiagnosed as progressive dementias, aphasia, memory disorders, and psychoses; (5) they are the only disturbance of the higher functions that commonly cause patients to produce statements that appear to be extremely witty; (6) they can be readily studied experimentally; (7) they are the most common cause of unconcern with or denial of illness. There are almost certainly several different forms of confusional state depending on the aetiology, the rate of development, the age, and the anatomical systems involved, but little classification has yet been carried on. Confusional states are most simply defined as disorders in which there is a loss of the normal coherence of thought or action. Among the striking clinical features are: (1) failure to pay attention, excessive distractibility, or failure to shift attention; (2) paramnesias, i.e. distortions of memory; (3) reduplicative phenomena, ‘wild’ paraphasias with ‘propagation’ of error, alterations of mood in many different directions; (4) isolated or predominant disturbance of writing (the most common cause of pure agraphia); (5) unconcern with or denial of illness; (6) apparently playful behaviour. While confusional states are usually attributed to ‘global involvement of the brain’ as a result of metabolic or toxic disorder, there are in fact many cases produced by focal infarctions in the right hemisphere, which, in the experience of my department, is one of the commonest effects of cerebrovascular disease. Brief reference is made to the prognosis, and to the theoretical significance for cerebral dominance and the evolutionary development of cerebral dominance in non-human species.",

The disease manifests in early childhood with nonspecific symptoms such as hypotension, movement disorders (oculogyric crisis, dystonia, hypokinesia), developmental delay and vegetative symptoms. Currently, diagnostic criteria for this disease have been determined, as well as possible options for correcting the patient’s condition. However, often, the no specificity of AADC deficiency symptoms leads to a significant delay in diagnosis or even misdiagnosis in patients with AADC deficiency. Identification of patients with AADC deficiency will improve their quality of life due to possible syndromic treatment, facilitate their care and prolong life. In the absence of a correct diagnosis, children with AADC deficiency may be observed for a long time with diagnoses such as cerebral palsy or epilepsy and receive therapy that has no therapeutic effect or may lead to a worsening of the symptoms of the underlying disease.",

The clinical finding is an acute-subacute onset of generalised weakness with difficulty in weaning the patient from the ventilator, due to polyneuropathy, myopathy, prolonged neuromuscular blockade or a combination of these disorders. Although having a multifactorial ethiopathology, the major risk factors in the development of these disorders are multiple organ failure and sepsis for polyneuropathy; corticosteroids and neuromuscular junction blocking agents (NMB) for myopathy; and NMB and renal and liver failure for prolonged neuromuscular blockade. No specific treatment exists, which is why--due to the high incidence of these syndromes and their poor prognosis, with a mortality rate higher than 50%--we should recognise, diagnose and avoid, where possible, the conditions that help the development of these disorders.",

      "title": "A survey of peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) use",
      "abstract": "EDITOR: Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants retain a vital place in anaesthetic practice. The number of available muscle relaxants has increased in recent years. All of these drugs vary in speed of onset, duration of action and in speed of offset. The manufacturers produce guidance for the use of these drugs in the form of data sheets. These may give recommendations for initial dose, speed of onset and duration of action. Clinical practice is however, likely to vary considerably with the manufacturer's guidance for the following reasons: 1. Variable individual response to muscle relaxants. Marked variation has been shown between healthy individuals for the same dose of muscle relaxant [1] 2. Renal function. Impaired renal function may prolong the duration of action. 3. Liver disease or reduced hepatic blood flow. These may prolong the duration of action. 4. Electrolyte disturbances. These may prolong the duration of action. 5. Other drugs. Aminoglycosides prolong the duration of action, other drugs may also affect the duration of action. 6. Obesity. Dose requirements are affected with variation between the different muscle relaxants. Knowledge about the state of neuromuscular blockade is important from induction through to recovery. Inadequate neuromuscular blockade during the procedure may make surgery difficult, and has the potential to be extremely dangerous to the patient. At the end of the procedure there is the potential for an awake patient with residual paralysis or for recurarization during the recovery period. Residual neuromuscular blockade may increase the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications [2]. The peripheral nerve stimulator is not the perfect monitor; it measures neuromuscular function in the periphery, which is more sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants than is diaphragmatic muscle [3]. It may give an inaccurate test due to poor electrical contact or incorrect placement. At present, it is the most common monitor of neuromuscular function. This is due to its simplicity, ease of use, portability and cost. We have undertaken a survey to establish current practice in respect of PNS usage at five hospitals. We aimed to assess use and availability of the PNS. We also wanted to identify the factors which influence PNS usage, such as duration of anaesthesia and the muscle relaxant used. A questionnaire was sent to all grades of anaesthetist at five hospitals. Three teaching hospitals and two district general hospitals. The questionnaire asked a number of questions about PNS usage. One hundred questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 57%, of these, replies were from consultants (48%), from training grades (48%) and from other grades (4%). Question 1: Is there a place for using a peripheral nerve stimulator while using a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant in your practice? Yes 89% No 11% Question 2: If a PNS is available in the theatre, how often do you use it? Never 8% Sometimes 74% Always 17% Question 3: Will you use a peripheral nerve stimulator if the duration of operation is less than 20 min, 20-40 min, 40-60 min and over 60 min? (Table 1)Table 1: Use of PNS with duration of operation Question 4: How often is a peripheral nerve stimulator available? (Table 2)Table 2: Availability of PNS in theatre (%) Question 5: How often do you use a peripheral nerve stimulator with different muscle relaxants? (Table 3)Table 3: Use of PNS with particular relaxants as percentage The response rate of 57% was disappointing but did show some marked differences. The large majority of anaesthetists (89%) in our survey have a need for a peripheral nerve stimulator in their practice. Most use it for selected cases, with a small group using it for all cases in whom a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant is used (17%). This survey found that a factor affecting usage was the duration of anaesthesia with the number of anaesthetists always using a PNS rising from 11% for operations of 20-40 min duration to 21% always using a PNS for operations of 40-60 min. This may reflect the fact that an induction dose of muscle relaxant will often last between 20 and 40 min, but repeat doses are likely if the duration exceeds 40 min. There appeared to be a relation between the choice of muscle relaxant and the duration of drug action, with the least use for the short-acting mivacurium and most use for the long-acting pancuronium. It was interesting to find no increase in PNS use for the newer agents. This may reflect their predictability, although there are reports of recurarization with rocuronium [4]. It is of concern that in some hospitals there are insufficient nerve stimulators. The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland recommends that a means of assessing neuromuscular block should be available whenever neuromuscular blocking drugs are used [5]. In the case of one teaching hospital, 40% of respondents reported that peripheral nerve stimulators were 'rarely available' or 'never available'. While their use is not mandatory they should be readily available in every theatre complex. The results of this survey were presented to this hospital and have resulted in the provision of four extra peripheral nerve stimulators for the theatre complex. The use of the PNS helps with anaesthetic training and with the introduction of new or modified muscle relaxants but above all it may improve anaesthetic standards by preventing over- or under-curarization.

Instead, some people maintain relatively normal cognitive functioning despite neuropathologic burden, a phenomenon called cognitive resilience. Using a longitudinal, epidemiological, clinical-pathologic cohort study (N=348), the present research investigated associations between well-being and cognitive resilience. Consistent with pre-registered hypotheses, higher eudaimonic well-being (i.e., Ryff Psychological Well-being Scale) and higher hedonic well-being (i.e., Satisfaction with Life Scale) were associated with better-than-expected cognitive functioning relative to one’s neuropathological burden (i.e., beta-amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies, vascular pathologies, hippocampal sclerosis, and TDP-43). The association of eudaimonic well-being in particular was present above and beyond known cognitive resilience factors (i.e., socioeconomic status, education, cognitive activity, low neuroticism, low depression) and dementia risk factors (i.e., ApoE genotype, medical comorbidities). This research highlights the importance of considering eudaimonic well-being in efforts to prevent dementia.",

      "title": "Neurotoxicity of general anesthetics: A modern view of the problem",
      "abstract": "All general anesthetics routinely used in clinical practice are noted to have a neurotoxic effect on the brain in different animal species including primates. The negative effects observed both in young and sexually mature animals include apoptotic neuronal cell death, suppression of neurogenesis and gliogenesis, neuroinflammation, as well as learning and memory impairments. A number of epidemiologic surveys have established an association between anesthesia in patients younger than 3 to 4 years and subsequent learning disabilities and language disorders whereas others have not found this link. In middle-aged and elderly patients, anesthesia is frequently associated with the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. The key component of its pathogenesis (general anesthesia itself or other factors, such as operative injury, an inflammatory response, pain syndrome, intraoperative complications, underlying disease in a patient) remains unelucidated. It is concluded that there is a need for additional experimental and clinical studies of the pathogenesis of these undesirable phenomena to be prevented and corrected.",

      "title": "Alcohol-Induced Blackout",
      "abstract": "Blackouts from acute alcohol ingestion are defined as the inability to recall events that occurred during a drinking episode and are highly prevalent in both alcoholic and nonalcoholic populations. This article reviews the clinical manifestations, epidemiology, risk factors, cognitive impairment, and neurobiology associated with alcohol-induced blackout, with special emphasis on the neurochemical and neurophysiological basis, and gender differences. Two types of blackout have been identified: en bloc, or complete inability to recall events during a time period, and fragmentary, where memory loss is incomplete. The rapidity of rise in blood alcohol concentration is the most robust predictor of blackout. Alcohol impairs different brain functions at different rates, and cognitive and memory performance are differentially impaired by ascending versus descending blood alcohol concentration. Cognitive and memory impairment occurs before motor impairment, possibly explaining how a drinker appearing fully functional can have little subsequent memory. Blackouts are caused by breakdown in the transfer of short-term memory into long-term storage and subsequent retrieval primarily through dose-dependent disruption of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell activity. The exact mechanism is believed to involve potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-alpha-mediated inhibition and interference with excitatory hippocampal N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation, resulting in decreased long-term potentiation. Another possible mechanism involves disrupted septohippocampal theta rhythm activity because of enhanced medial septal area gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurotransmission. Women are more susceptible to blackouts and undergo a slower recovery from cognitive impairment than men, due in part to the effect of gender differences in pharmacokinetics and body composition on alcohol bioavailability.",

      "abstract": "In humans, chronic cocaine abuse is associated with changes in the central nervous system (CNS). Neuropathological changes include cerebrovascular events, EEG abnormalities, vasculitis, seizures, and decrements in neurobehavioral performance. The acute administration of cocaine is associated with acute psychotic episodes and paranoid states while withdrawal from the drug is often associated with depressed mood. The mechanistic basis of these behavioral states is not known. Given the structural and functional changes associated with cocaine use, we propose that the chronic heavy use of cocaine may result in a neuropsychiatric syndrome which might be associated with neuropsychological changes that are not obvious during routine clinical evaluation of drug-using individuals. This disconnection syndrome, because of its sublety, might have deleterious effects on both acute and long-term therapeutic interventions with these subjects. An approach which deals with cocaine abuse as a neuropsychiatric disorder might be more beneficial to the long-term goal of treating these patients.

      "title": "Serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontinuation syndrome: a hypothetical definition. Discontinuation Consensus panel.",
      "abstract": "Adverse events following discontinuation from serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are being reported in the literature with increasing frequency; the frequency and severity of these symptoms appear to vary according to the half-life of the SRI, e.g., the incidence appears higher with the shorter half-life agents than with fluoxetine, which has an extended half-life. Yet, there have been no systematic studies of the phenomenon to date. Therefore, a group of experts convened in Phoenix, Arizona, to develop a clear description or definition of the phenomenon based on these reports. The SRI discontinuation syndrome, referred to as \"withdrawal symptoms\" in many anecdotal case reports, is distinctly different from the classic withdrawal syndrome associated with alcohol and barbiturates. Anti-depressants are not associated with dependence or drug-seeking behavior. SRI discontinuation symptoms tend to be short-lived and self-limiting, but can be troublesome. They may emerge when an SRI is abruptly discontinued, when doses are missed, and less frequently, during dosage reduction. In addition, the symptoms are not attributable to any other cause and can be reversed when the original agent is reinstituted, or one that is pharmacologically similar is substituted. SRI discontinuation symptoms, in most cases, may be minimized by slowly tapering antidepressant therapy, but there have been several case reports where symptoms occurred consistently even through repeated attempts to taper therapy. Physical symptoms include problems with balance, gastrointestinal and flu-like symptoms, and sensory and sleep disturbances. Psychological symptoms include anxiety and/or agitation, crying spells, and irritability. Further analyses of data bases and clinical studies are needed to define this proposed syndrome more clearly.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia in Late Life: Findings Challenge Traditional Concepts",
      "abstract": "Two notions about schizophrenia have persisted: (1) it is characterized by onset in adolescence or early adulthood, and (2) it has a progressively deteriorating course. Recent studies focusing on early-adulthood- and middle-age-onset schizophrenia challenge these views. Patients with early-onset schizophrenia and middle-age-onset schizophrenia (MAOS) are similar in terms of family history of schizophrenia, presence of minor physical anomalies, early childhood maladjustment, severity of positive symptoms, presence of gross structural abnormalities on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, overall pattern of neuropsychologic deficits, and qualitative response to neuroleptic medications. Differences include a higher proportion of women among MAOS patients, and the tendency for MAOS patients to have less severe negative symptoms, better neuropsychologic performance (particularly in learning and abstraction/cognitive flexibility), and possibly larger thalamic volume and to respond to lower doses of neuroleptic medications. While onset of schizophrenia-like symptoms in very late life may reflect an acquired condition that is not \"true schizophrenia,\" and that may be labeled \"very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis,\" findings suggest that true schizophrenia can arise after early adulthood. Middle-age-onset schizophrenia is predominantly neurodevelopmental, but it is also a distinct neurobiological subtype of schizophrenia. Our studies also demonstrate that neuropsychologic functioning remains stable in chronic schizophrenia outpatients, even when observed over several years and in the presence of significant fluctuations in the severity of clinical symptoms.",

By the traditional definition, SE is not established until the duration reaches 30 minutes. Refractory SE occurs when an adequately dosed initial benzodiazepine and one other antiseizure medication have failed to stop the seizure.2 The overall short-term mortality of convulsive SE in children is notable at 3%–5%3 and is at least twice as high for refractory SE.4 Overall morbidity for convulsive SE in children is 10%–30% and over 50% for refractory SE.3 These data indicate that longer seizures result in worse outcomes.",

Design and Methods:In a retrospective study, we evaluated 48 nondemented, nondepressed patients with clinical and psychometric evidence of memory impairment who were followed up for 2 or more years.Ageadjusted normative criteria were used to identify whether additional impairments were present in language, attention, motor visuospatial function, and verbal fluency at this initial evaluation.The presence or absence of dementia after 2 years and at the most recent neurological evaluation was compared in subjects with normal scores in all 4 of these cognitive areas apart from memory (M-) and those with impairment in 1 or more of these areas (M+).Outcomes were adjusted for age, intelligence at initial evaluation, and years of education.",

The development of post-traumatic psychopathology depends on individual vulnerability, both genetic and acquired, the nature and severity of the traumatic event, and the quality of the post-traumatic environment. Children who are the victims of abuse or neglect may be particularly profoundly affected by their experience. Even if the stress is only relatively small, if the trauma occurs at a sensitive or critical period of psychological development, a child's cognitive or emotional functioning may not progress normally. The psychopathology of severe personality disorder may thus originate at an early age. Adults who have previously experienced such traumaticevents and who are then involved in later traumatic incidents may be particularly susceptible subsequently to manifest severe psychological disorder. However, even if there is no pre-existing vulnerability, severe trauma can lead to the development of the full range of abnormal psychological symptoms in someone who was previously healthy.",

The concept of permanent learning disability is a familiar one. Brain damage or dysfunction from a variety of causes can result in permanent intellectual impairment. State-dependent learning disability is less widely recognised as an important phenomenon in people with epilepsy. This is learning disability that depends on the state of the individual at that time; antiepileptic medication (AEDs) or the epilepsy itself may be affecting the person at a particular time in a way that is not necessarily permanent. Why should treatment be considered? Because state-dependent learning disability is potentially reversible, and the consequent improvement in cognitive function may result in a significant improvement in quality of life. To put the case more strongly, a doctor might be considered as being incompetent if he or she failed to recognise and treat state-dependent learning disability, in view of the fact that correct treatment can result in such a significant improvement in the life of the individual. In some cases, the treatment might be to reduce medication, whereas in others, if the epilepsy itself is affecting cognition at the time, it may be necessary to provide alternative or additional antiepileptic treatment in the form of medication or surgery. The first step in managing state-dependent learning disability is to think of the diagnosis. Regrettably, this possibility is often not considered, and the patient goes untreated. State-dependent learning disability in people with epilepsy can be divided into two broad categories: drug induced (2,3) and epilepsy induced. Drug-induced state-dependent learning disability may be direct or indirect. Direct effects of drugs include sedation by drugs such as phenobarbitone (PB), primidone (PRM), or the benzodiazepines (BZDs). Attention deficit induced by these drugs, particularly in children (4), can also produce state-dependent learning disability. Indirect effects on learning ability include such adverse effects as diplopia or irritability. Although these do not affect cognition itself, they affect the ability of the individual to perform cognitive tasks competently (5). State-dependent learning disability from the epilepsy itself may result from ictal effects of subtle seizures, focal discharges, or postictal effects. Frequent absence seizures may be not at all apparent to a casual observer but can affect cognition to a major degree. If these occur sufficiently frequently, they amount to nonconvulsive status epilepticus (6). Complex partial seizure status epilepticus is another form of nonconvulsive status epilepticus that can impair cognition significantly (7). Both of these phenomena are acknowledged in the literature but may nevertheless escape detection in clinical situations. Extensive work has now been published on transitory cognitive impairment (8,9). The published literature includes attempts at therapeutic trials to improve cognition that has been impaired through this mechanism, which involves focal discharges causing specific cognitive deficits (10). More frequent localised discharges can cause apparently ongoing cognitive impairment rather than transitory cognitive impairment. For example, frequent epileptiform discharges in the dominant hemisphere can cause ongoing language deficits. If the discharges cease, because of either medical or surgical treatment, cognitive function can improve. A 13-year-old girl with speech and language impairment underwent a left temporal lobectomy. Preoperatively she had very frequent left temporal epileptiform discharges. In the year after the surgery, her language ability rose from the 4-year level to the 7-year level. The extreme example of frequent localised epileptiform discharges is provided by subjects who have a gross abnormality of one hemisphere that acts as a source of these discharges. This situation can arise, for example, with hemimegalencephaly or with the hemiatrophy accompanying Rasmussen's encephalitis. After hemispherectomy, not only are the seizures often fully controlled, but cognition and behaviour may also improve because the remaining hemisphere is released from the storm of epileptiform discharges that were previously coming from the abnormal hemisphere (11). State-dependent learning disability resulting from postictal changes might appear to be such an obvious phenomenon that it would not warrant further discussion. Unfortunately this is not the case. This is well illustrated by the following example. An apparently dementing teenager sat rocking in his chair during most of the waking hours, disorientated in space and barely able to carry out a conversation. At night he wandered, causing considerable disruption. The initial management was similar to that provided to geriatric dementing, disorientated patients. At that time he was having between three and five seizures per day. After a medication review, the seizures were fully controlled. He became fully oriented, able to carry out his tasks of daily living, and began reading again. Experienced staff had viewed him as being effectively ineducable before the medication review and had assumed that very little could be done for him. After he became seizure free, he was capable of learning again, gained greatly from the educational input, and made excellent progress. When the seizures had been frequent, he had been in a constant postictal state, having insufficient time to recover from one seizure before he had another. Any child or adult with epilepsy who has variable daytime performance should be suspected of having nocturnal seizures (12). Sometimes these seizures can be so subtle that they are not noticed even by awake night staff. Video-telemetry has revealed that patients may wake briefly after such nocturnal seizures. This implies that they not only have the postictal effects of many overnight seizures, but they are also affected adversely by having a very broken night's sleep. Treatment of the nocturnal seizures may improve the situation greatly. Electrical status epilepticus of slow-wave sleep (ESES) or continuous spike and wave in slow-wave sleep (CSWS) has aroused much interest in recent years (13). This appears often to be present in cases of the Landau–Kleffner syndrome (14). A recent study carried out in the author's unit confirmed that the specific deficits are not always in language function. A patient under the author's care who had ESES experienced great difficulty because of visuospatial deficits. His verbal abilities were quite good, but he could not find his way from his bedroom to the toilet at home. After treatment, the ESES was abolished, and his visuospatial skills improved greatly. Children with ESES provide an important model of state-dependent learning disability. It is said that around one third of children with the Landau–Kleffner syndrome do not have obvious seizures. This implies that any child who loses skills for no other apparent reason should have overnight EEG monitoring. This may allow a treatable cause for the cognitive loss to be found. Some of the situations already described, for example, the child in nonconvulsive status epilepticus or the individual who is in a withdrawn state because of the Landau–Kleffner syndrome, are good illustrations of how a child may have markedly autistic features that are the result of the epilepsy itself (15). When the nonconvulsive status epilepticus or ESES, respectively, is treated, the child is able to interact with the world and loses his or her autistic features. However, if the child is allowed to remain in a state in which interaction with the world is seriously impaired, for example, through very frequent absence seizures, the critical period for that social development may be passed before the epileptiform discharges resolve. The result may be a teenager who no longer has any epileptiform discharges but is nevertheless markedly autistic (16). If the child had been treated early enough to allow two-way social interaction to be established during the important developmental years, then this situation might not have developed. I have seen several examples of children who had frequent epileptiform discharges earlier in childhood and who no longer have these but have, nevertheless, retained markedly autistic features that appear to be permanent. This situation emphasises the importance of early detection and treatment of frequent epileptiform discharges that are affecting social interaction. The implication is that early treatment may prevent some of the long-term cognitive and social-interaction problems that would otherwise occur (17). The most important factor in helping to ensure that state-dependent learning disability does not go unrecognised and untreated is to make professionals aware of the possibility that a child or adult might have this condition. In particular, any individual who loses skills should be investigated energetically. If no cause has been found, then the investigation must include overnight EEG monitoring, even if no obvious seizures have ever been observed. The EEG monitoring may, for example, reveal ESES that was previously unsuspected but that is potentially treatable with AEDs, steroids, or neurosurgery. There is clearly a need for much more research in this area. In particular, there is a need for national protocols for investigating children who have lost skills so that the correct diagnosis can be made and those who have treatable conditions, such as state-dependent learning disability resulting from the epilepsy, can receive early treatment. The importance of the early developmental years of childhood cannot be overemphasised. Early treatment of state-dependent learning disability allows the child the possibility of gaining fully from these important developmental years. It is important that professionals always be aware of the possibility of state-dependent learning disability, particularly in an individual who has lost skills. If state-dependent learning disability is suspected, then investigation should be initiated without delay. These investigations will usually include overnight EEG monitoring. Early treatment of state-dependent learning disability may prevent permanent cognitive and social impairments.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive decline has been widely reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) despite its clinical heterogeneity, at all stages and in all subtypes of the disease. Deficits are most commonly present in attention, processing speed, working memory, verbal fluency and executive function. However, MS patients also show decreased performance in tasks related to social cognition, i.e. mental operations thatdrive interpersonal skills such as social perception, empathy and theory of mind. Social cognitive deficits are an underestimated but important aspect of impairment in MS, reflecting how people process, store, and apply information in social interactions. Deficits in these domains have been associated with reduced social and psychological quality of life, even after controlling for severity and duration of the disease, age, and neurocognitive performance. Social cognition impairment is not entirely dependent on and parallel to general cognitive dysfunction, given that some patients experience disorganization of their social life before a significant or detectable cognitive impairment. The decrease in performance of social cognition tasks may reflect changes in brain activity and brain structure, either general or regional. Both subtle diffuse pathology and acute local lesions have at least partially independent effects on aspects of social cognition. The observed white matter damage contributes to a mechanism of disruption in the network of brain connections involved in social cognition. Undoubtedly, there is a wide variability in the relationship of social cognitionand neuroanatomical findings, not only due to the brain's complex connectivity, but also to the lack of a unique operative definition of these cognitive domains. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare study results, given the variability of clinical presentations in all stages of the disease.More research would contribute in understanding social cognition deficits better and in determining whether and what kind of training could be beneficial.",

MDMA reduces the level of these neurotransmitters within the neural synapses by reducing the number of intraneural transporters to the synaptic clefts, increasing deactivation with the synapse and/ or increasing degradation with the pre- and postsynaptic neurons.

      "title": "Approach to neurometabolic diseases from a pediatric neurological point of view.",
      "abstract": "Objective Neurometabolic disorders are an important group of diseases that mostly are presented in newborns and infants. Neurological manifestations are the prominent signs and symptoms in this group of diseases. Seizures are a common sign and are often refractory to antiepileptic drugs in untreated neurometabolic patients. The onset of symptoms for neurometabolic disorders appears after an interval of normal or near normal growth and development.Additionally, affected children may fare well until a catabolic crisis occurs. Patients with neurometabolic disorders during metabolic decompensation have severe clinical presentation, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This symptom is often fatal but severe neurological insult and regression in neurodevelopmental milestones can result as a prominent sign in patients who survived. Acute symptoms should be immediately treated regardless of the cause. A number of patients with neurometabolic disorders respond favorably and, in some instances, dramatically respond to treatment. Early detection and early intervention is invaluable in some patients to prevent catabolism and normal or near normal neurodevelopmental milestones. This paper discusses neurometabolic disorders, approaches to this group of diseases (from the view of a pediatric neurologist), clinical and neurological manifestations, neuroimaging and electroencephalography findings, early detection, and early treatment.",

      "abstract": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is a medical emergency, which is diagnosed most frequently with the routine use of EEG in the pediatric emergency and intensive care units. Data from eight patients, ranging from 2.8-15 years old (median 8.7 years), treated with the diagnosis of NCSE were evaluated on clinical basis. The patients attended the hospital with acute confusional state ranging from sudden onset of verbal cooperation insufficiency to aimless-meaningless behavior and confusion without any motor component of seizure. While five of the cases were diagnosed and followed up with epilepsy, the other three had no history of epilepsy. No reason was detected that could cause acute encephalopathy. EEG examinations during acute confusional state showed partial or generalized continuous electrographic seizure activity lasting at least 30 minutes without clinical seizure activity. After administration of intravenous antiepileptic medication, the confusional states of the patients recovered, and the EEG examinations showed normal baseline activity with significantly diminished discharges or complete normal waveform. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should be considered in all children admitted to the hospital with acute unexplained encephalopathy, whether they have a history of epilepsy or not. Emergent EEG examination should be a routine part of evaluation in these children for the diagnosis and treatment of NCSE.",

The diagnostic assessment must be identified from the subjective report and objective features. Various assessments of measuring akathisia can be clinically used by instrumental methods and rating scales. The pharmacological basis of neuroleptic-induced akathisia is the inhibition of the dopamine receptors in the brain. The pathogenesis of neuroleptic-induced akathisia may involve GABAergic hypoactivity, noradrenergic hyperactivity, and serotonergic dysfunction in CNS. Iron deficiency and hyperglycemia may be risk factors of neuroleptic induced akathisia in relation to the dopamine function in the brain. Neurological disorders may be associated with the development of a syndrome resembling drug-induced akathisia. The lesion of the thalamic nuclei would originally produce the syndrome. The difference between acute and tardive akathisia on the strategy of the drug treatment should be sufficiently comprehended. In particular, the long-term use of anticholinergic drugs and benzodiazepines should not be prevailed.",

Imbalance of neurotransmitters, particularly of the dopaminergic system, accounting for the often dramatic clinical features, has been uncovered and is successfully repressed by dopamine antagonists [5, 26]. Other neurotransmitter systems are affected as well [5, 26]. Imbalance is caused by profound neuronal dysfunction due to neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative dysregulation and is also detectable in less spectacular and therefore initially often ignored symptoms [36, 38]. In fact, a remarkable worsening of cognitive/mental performance can be observed during early episodes of the psychosis [20, 36], supporting the concept of a major neuronal damage occurring at that time.",

      "abstract": "The understanding of aging processes is becoming increasingly relevant since the average age and longevity of the population is increasing. Normal aging is associated with some changes in intellectual functioning. While the so-called cristallized intellectual abilities (e.g., vocabulary, reasoning) are relatively preserved, there is a significant decline in cognitive functions belonging to the \"fluid\" domains (e.g., perceptual speed, memory load). Nevertheless, effects of plasticity can also be observed in aging. The latter is subserved by environmental stimulation. Along with the aging process there is an increase in prevalence of the dementia syndromes. In many patients dementia is preannounced by some partial intellectual decline, mostly in the memory domain. This syndrome is described as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and represents in some cases a prodromal phase of dementia, since a high proportion of MCI patients convert to dementia within a year. Unfortunately, most clinicians do not screen for cognitive problems in their practice unless they receive complaints from either the patients or their relatives.",

      "title": "Late life depression with cognitive impairment: Evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Older adults with depression often present with signs and symptoms indicative of functional or cognitive impairment. These somatic symptoms make evaluating and treating depression in older adults more complex. Late life depression (LLD), depression in adults over the age of 65, is more frequently associated with cognitive changes. Cognitive impairment in LLD may be a result of the depressive disorder or an underlying dementing condition. Memory complaints are also common in older adults with depression. There is a wide range of cognitive impairment in LLD including decreased central processing speed, executive dysfunction, and impaired short-term memory. The etiology of cognitive impairment in LLD may include cerebrovascular disease, a significant risk factor for LLD, which likely interrupts key pathways between frontal white matter and subcortical structures important in mood regulation. Because depressive symptoms often coexist with dementia, it is important to determine the temporal relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive change. If depressive symptoms pre-date the cognitive impairment and cognitive symptoms are mild and temporary, LLD is the likely etiology of the cognitive impairment. If cognitive changes appear prior to depressive symptoms and persist after LLD is successfully treated, an underlying dementia is more likely. Clinicians should be exclude common conditions such as thyroid disease which can contribute to depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment prior to treating LLD. Both antidepressants and psychotherapy can be effective in treating LLD. Subsequent evaluations following treatment should also reassess cognition.",

      "abstract": "Background: Exogenous melatonin is commonly used to treat insomnia, other sleep problems, and numerous medical illnesses, including Alzheimer’s disease, autism spectrum disorder, and mild cognitive impairment in adults and children. There is evolving information regarding issues with the use of chronic melatonin. Methods: The present investigation was a narrative review. Results: Melatonin usage has risen dramatically in recent years. Many countries only allow melatonin prescriptions. In the United States (U.S.), it is classified as a dietary supplement accessible over the counter and can be derived from animals, microorganisms, or, most commonly, made synthetically. No regulatory agency oversees its manufacturing or sale in the U.S. melatonin concentration of marketed preparations varies widely between product labels and manufacturers. Melatonin’s ability to induce sleep is detectable. However, it is modest for most people. Sleep length appears to be less important in sustained-release preparations. The optimal dosage is unknown, and routinely used amounts vary substantially. Melatonin’s short-term negative effects are minimal, resolve at medicine cessation, and do not usually prevent usage overall. Much research on long-term melatonin administration has found no difference between exogenous melatonin and placebo in terms of long-term negative effects. Conclusion: Melatonin at low to moderate dosages (approximately 5–6 mg daily or less) appears safe. Long-term usage appears to benefit certain patient populations, such as those with autism spectrum disorder. Studies investigating potential benefits in reducing cognitive decline and increased longevity are ongoing. However, it is widely agreed that the long-term effects of taking exogenous melatonin have been insufficiently studied and warrant additional investigation.",

      "title": "Recommendation for a definition of acute symptomatic seizure",
      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

A more accurate clinical observation has narrowed its meaning, and in many cases that would formerly have been called neurasthenia, and which would have been treated as such, are now recognized as nervous features due to some bodily derangement not primarily nervous. Chronic disorder of internal organs may, and often does, predispose to neurasthenia and by interference with nutrition, by exhaustion, or by toxemic states, the resistive capacity of the nervous system is lowered so that it more easily succumbs to the ordinary stress of life. There is, of course, stress in every life; every man, whether he drives a dray or runs a bank, is subject to stress of mind and body, and that which befalls the man of low capacity and rude life may be relatively to his strength and his outlook on the world",

The distribution of different causes may reflect the geographic location of the hospital. The most common substances used for self-inflicted death by poisoning are tricyclic antidepressants, salicylates (particularly children), and street drugs. In the elderly, suicide attempts and unintentional intoxication through misjudgment of dose remain the leading causes. Overdose and acute brain injury may go together. Patients with traumatic brain injury may have been intoxicated or overdosed and some strokes are seen after use of illicit drugs. It is important to assess the severity of the intoxication, but also the management of the patient particularly when there are recurrent seizures or permanent unexplained unconsciousness. The neurointensivist should have a good working knowledge of the pharmacodynamics of ingested or injected drugs in large quantities and how to interpret neuroimaging.",

Most frequently mood disorders have a primary origin, following poligenic multifactorial model. Moreover there is a non negligible proportion of cases in which depressive symptoms accompany neurological illnesses or they even constitute a part of predominant manifestations at the clinical start of neurologic disease, or mark a point of inflexion in its course. The aim of the present article is to review relevant literature dealing with this topic.A significative higher frequency of depressive phenomenology, not explainable by hazard, can be an early manifestation in children and adolescents with: epileptic syndromes, sleep disorders, chronic recurrent cephalalgias, several neurometabolic diseases, and intracranial tumors. Points of coincidence have been shown in dysequilibrium of brain neurotransmitters (serotonine, noradrenaline, hyperglutamatergic states) which could not be hypothesized as maintaining both neurological and mood conditions.The suspiction of a neurological disease should be adopted in cases of mood disorder not easily explainable by familial antecedents or clear biographical stressors. The search for a brain disorder by means of a meticulous anamnesis and neurological clinical and ancillary exams makes possible to discover the brain disorder at a very early stage and ameliorate the chances of accurately manage both the neurological and mood disorders. The simultaneous treatment of both dimension of the illness helps to improve the patients' quality of life.Fenomenologia depresiva al inicio de enfermedades neuropediatricas.Introduccion. La depresion, en sus diversas formas, afecta al 8-10% de niños y adolescentes y en la mayor parte de casos su origen es primario, siguiendo el modelo genetico multifactorial. Pero hay una proporcion de pacientes, no bien cuantificada todavia, en la que la depresion acompaña precozmente una enfermedad neurologica o marca un punto de inflexion en el curso de esta. El objetivo es revisar la bibliografia al respecto. Desarrollo. Se observa fenomenologia depresiva, con una frecuencia significativamente mayor que por azar, en niños y adolescentes afectos de epilepsia, trastornos del sueño, cefaleas primarias cronicas recurrentes, enfermedades neurometabolicas y tumores intracraneales. En varias de estas patologias neuropediatricas se hipotetizan puntos de coincidencia fisiopatologica con la depresion a traves de un deficit de disponibilidad cerebral de serotonina y noradrenalina. No se considera aqui la depresion disadaptativa a una neurodiscapacidad cronica. Conclusiones. En niños y adolescentes, los trastornos del animo sintomaticos de enfermedad neurologica deben sospecharse en ausencia de antecedentes familiares o de experiencias vitales que los expliquen. La busqueda sistematica de anomalias neurologicas y los examenes complementarios permitirian en estos casos abordar precozmente el tratamiento de la enfermedad cerebral causante del cuadro depresivo. A su vez, como ocurre en casos de epilepsia, cefaleas o trastorno del sueño, la terapia farmacologica y psicologica del cuadro depresivo contribuye a mejorar la calidad de vida de los afectados.",

      "abstract": "Individuals suffering from mental illnesses, unfortunately, have a shorter lifespan. An increase in mortality rates is primarily due to physical illness, unhealthy lifestyle, and associated comorbidities. Antipsychotic medications, previously known as tranquilizers, antipsychotics, or neuroleptics, can alleviate or attenuate symptoms related to psychosis, delusion, and/or hallucinations and are used in the treatment of psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, or Alzheimer's disease. Within hours to days, these medications alleviate symptoms and reduce confusion in individuals with psychosis; however, the full effect may take longer than usual in some cases. Importantly, these drugs do not cure the disease, but only treat the symptoms of the disease. The treatment is adjusted to reduce any psychotic symptoms while keeping the adverse effects to a minimum level. Antipsychotics may lead to increased risk of diseases, including but not limited to, diabetes, obesity, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular, renal, or respiratory disorders. Improved dosages, polypharmacy, and age-specific treatment play an important role in limiting the comorbidities, as well as the side effects. Further research and clinical attention are required to understand the functioning of these medications. The review focuses on the use of antipsychotic medications in different diseases and their effect on mental health.",

      "title": "Personality Disorders",
      "abstract": "Compared with many other psychiatric disorders, personality disorders are relatively difficult and time intensive to diagnose and treat. In elderly persons, personality problems are confounded by a variety of additional issues, both negative and positive. The natural history of personality in later life is affected by the combination of increasing medical-neuropsychiatric comorbidity with ongoing normal psychosocial development. As a person ages, the likelihood of multiple chronic diseases increases. The existence of comorbidity results in more functional impairment and requires adaptation (Marengoni et al. 2011). It can become more difficult to ascertain the primary cause of increased impairment and to determine where best to focus therapeutic interventions. The risk of neurocognitive disorders also increases dramatically in later life. A common feature of dementias is a change in personality or an exacerbation of preexisting characteristics. Without longitudinal history it can be difficult to know whether such presentations are manifestations of a personality disorder, a neurocognitive disorder, or both. It is not uncommon for geriatric psychiatrists to comment that problems related to personality disorders are less frequently a focus in their patients compared with the patients of their general psychiatry colleagues. Prevalence studies tend to support this observation. If these prevalence studies are valid, there are several explanations as to why at least some personality disorders might fade with age. One that deserves attention is that of maturation, described in adult development theory and research. Although general research in personality disorders has increased, there is a relative dearth of such studies with respect to elderly persons (Agronin and Maletta 2000). This lack is particularly clear in the area of treatment. Substantial evidence shows the negative effect of personality disorders on the outcome of depressive disorders in elderly persons. In contrast to research on personality disorders, there has been a dramatic increase in research on the relationship of personality traits in the elderly to cognitive dysfunction, morbidity, and mortality (Oldham and Skodol 2013). Although certain personality traits are significantly related to poor outcomes, evidence on the benefits of treatment for personality traits or disorders in elderly persons remains limited. There is even less evidence on treatment and outcomes in nursing homes and general hospitals, the settings in which the geriatric psychiatrist is most likely to be called on to diagnose and treat personality disorders and traits.",

However, various dichotomous as well as dimensional definitions have been used to label anxious depression and it remains unclear to which extent these result in inconsistent findings. This review provides an overview of recent literature on the impact of anxiety in depressed patients on clinical course trajectories, treatment outcomes, and underlying neurobiological dysregulations.Anxious depression seems associated with poorer clinical course trajectories and treatment nonresponse as compared with 'pure' depression, regardless of which definition is used. Recent studies have attempted to determine specific efficacy of novel pharmacological treatments for anxious depressed patients, but have not been conclusive because of the insufficient number of studies and differences in definitions and assessment of anxious depression. Neurobiology studies suggest that anxious depression is associated with increased immune dysregulation, more cortical thinning, and corticolimbic dysfunctions as compared with 'pure' depression.Anxious depression appears to be a common and clinically relevant subtype of depression as it predicts poorer course trajectories. As populations with anxious depression may benefit from specific treatment regimens, further research is necessary to better delineate its definition and neurobiology. The relatively new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 anxious distress specifier is a welcome development and should be further investigated and compared against other anxiety constructs.",

Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "abstract": "The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) defines insomnia simply as \"difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep\". Other definitions exist, and there is no clear consensus in this matter. The core elements of insomnia are an inadequate quantity or quality of sleep, with both nocturnal and daytime consequences. Traditionally, insomnia has been subgrouped into sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintaining insomnia, and insomnia with early morning awakening; however, there is extensive overlap, and most insomniacs fit into more than one subgroup. Sleep disorders, particularly in the elderly, are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality, significant limitations in activities of daily living, and impaired quality of life. Aside from the obvious complications of daytime fatigue and somnolence, insomniacs have an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, increased use of over-the-counter medications and alcohol, and a higher incidence of accidents and unemployment. Chronic sleep loss has multisystem consequences and may represent a risk factor for obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. However, the brunt of negative effects of sleep deprivation is borne by the brain. Chronic insomnia independently predicts incident cognitive decline in older men, but it also has been suggested that some degree of apparent age-related cognitive decline may be due to treatable insomnia.",

It is also not unusual for other neurological problems, such as epilepsy, to complicate the picture. The question is always whether the intellectual problems are due to a static defect, or are part of a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Many conditions declare themselves with the passage of years. However, a small but significant group of conditions are sufficiently indolent in their progress to cause no obvious deterioration until late adolescence or adulthood. In this situation, a parent or carer may ask the adult neurologist to assess whether the perceived decline in functioning is real, and if so, what the cause is. This situation is often far from clear-cut, and so I will try and provide some guidance for when this difficult diagnostic problem arises.

The neurobiology of mood and emotionMood can be defined as a relatively lasting emotional or affective state.Mood and emotion differ in that mood lasts longer than an emotion, is less specific, often less intense, and less likely to be triggered by a particular stimulus or event.Mood can be considered a normal physiological affective state generated by the brain.Mood disorders, a pathological emotional state, are disabling disturbances of mood or emotion.They most likely result from a failure to regulate mood (Johnstone et al, 2007).Major depression, for instance, can be described as a failure to regulate negative emotions.This is similar to fear, a physiological emotional state, and anxiety disorder, a pathological state, where a failure to regulate fear circuits leads to anxiety even though objective information about the outside world may indicate that the situation is not dangerous (LeDoux, 2003).Major depression is usually characterized by persistent mood states such as",

      "title": "Pathophysiologic basis for schizophrenia and the efficacy of antipsychotics.",
      "abstract": "Current concepts of schizophrenia and its treatment are discussed. Schizophrenia entails negative symptoms, such as behavioral and cognitive deficits, attributed to loss of normal functions, and positive, or florid, symptoms that originate from the disturbed function of the remainder of the brain. Schizophrenia type I has positive symptoms predominating, and schizophrenia type II has negative symptoms predominating. Many atypical antipsychotics are now in Phase II and Phase III development; the prototype, clozapine, is now available. These agents challenge traditional views about drug treatment in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia may be explained by a persistent impairment in one or more neurotransmitter or neuromodulatory regulatory mechanisms, resulting in unstable or erratic neurotransmission. A more complex conceptualization of the role of the dopaminergic system makes it possible to understand the lack of biochemical tolerance to the therapeutic effects of antipsychotics, the varied time to onset of effects and prevalence of extrapyramidal symptoms, and the differences in efficacy within and among patients. Drug selection on the basis of patient-specific biological markers and neuropsychological function might expedite treatment responses. Drug therapy should augment homeostatic mechanisms and restore appropriate dopaminergic responses to physiological stimuli. Atypical antipsychotics may act by stabilizing presynaptic activity at a new set point, activating prefrontal dopaminergic systems and inhibiting mesolimbic systems, or exerting pharmacologic or functional effects on other neurotransmitter and neuropeptidergic systems. The traditional view that schizophrenia is simply a manifestation of dopaminergic overactivity is inadequate. New investigative techniques and the study of atypical antipsychotics suggest that a dysregulation hypothesis may be more consistent with the complexities of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Individuals suffering from drug addiction may also manifest features of bipolar spectrum disorders. Hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments may render individuals vulnerable to later development of substance abuse. Bipolar disorders themselves may be altered or precipitated by substance use, most notably by stimulants (amphetamines), alcohol, and cannabinoids.The clinical usefulness of mood stabilizers, particularly antiepileptics, has been established as safe and effective in substance abusers with and without comorbid mood disorders. Most studies on this issue have been of short duration and focused on the resolution of a currently manifest period of illness. Few studies have been conducted on the usefulness of these drugs on the long-term longitudinal course of these diseases, such as frequently encountered recurrent relapses into states of agitation, impulsivity, and/or dissatisfaction. As opposed to the clinical experience with traditional antidepressants and neuroleptics, antiepileptics do not induce counter-polar states (depressed patients abruptly turning manic or hypomanic; nor patients currently hypomanic or manic turning abruptly depressed). Many clinicians consider antiepileptic mood stabilizers to be the preferred category of medications for the treatment of such patients. Valproate appears to be a potentially fruitful medication to study in these dual diagnosis patients due to preliminary evidence demonstrating its anticraving efficacy.",

Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

      "abstract": "The evidence linking delirium to poor outcomes after critical illness is compelling, including higher mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer length of intensive care unit stay, and long-term cognitive impairments. The attitude toward delirium in the neurologic community is shifting away from viewing it as an unmodifiable, inevitable consequence of severe illness to treating it is as a neurologic emergency, akin to seizures or encephalitis. Delirium, like other manifestations of critical illness encephalopathy, is an organ dysfunction syndrome. Given the brain's central role in maintaining homeostasis, brain failure may dysregulate many downstream functions of significant consequence in critically ill patients. The diagnosis of delirium may be confounded in patients with primary brain disorders, but nevertheless delirium symptoms in the neurologic population are also independently associated with worse outcomes. There is scant evidence for directed pharmacological treatment of delirium, but multicomponent care bundles that address the management of pain, agitation, sedation, and delirium are effective at reducing the burden of delirium in the general intensive care unit population. The management of delirium in the neurologic intensive care environment is mostly extrapolated from studies on general medical critical illness and noncritically ill neurologic patients. Further investigation into the unique risks and management needs of critically ill neurologic and neurosurgical patients is needed to reduce the burden of delirium in that population.",

      "title": "Sedation with Antipsychotics: Manage, Don't Accept Adverse 'Calming' Effect",
      "abstract": "Sedation is a frequent side effect of antipsychotics, especially at relatively high doses. Antipsychotics' sedative effects can reduce agitation in acute psychosis and promote sleep in insomnia, but long-term sedation may: [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] * interfere with schizophrenia patients' efforts to go to work or school or engage in normal socialization * prevent improvement from psychosocial training, psychiatric rehabilitation, and other treatments. This article discusses how to manage acute psychosis without oversedation and ways to address persistent sedation and chronic insomnia with less-sedating antipsychotics or adjunctive medications. Neurobiology or psychopharmacology? Many patients experience only mild, transient somnolence at the beginning of antipsychotic treatment, and most develop some tolerance to the sedating effects with continued administration. Others may have persistent daytime sedation that interferes with normal functioning. Sedation is especially common in elderly patients receiving antipsychotics. Compared with younger patients, older patients receiving the same doses of the same medications become more heavily sedated for longer periods of time. The resulting sedation can impair arousal levels during the day and increase the risk of falls. Sedation can occur with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), but it is seen more commonly and tends to be more severe with low-potency FGAs than with SGAs. Clinical challenges come with: * distinguishing between sedation and negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as avolition, amotivation, withdrawal, and anhedonia * determining whether an individual's cognitive impairment is related to the antipsychotic's sedative properties. Because the treatments are different, it is important to try to distinguish negative symptoms and/or cognitive impairment related to schizophrenia's neurobiology from sedation related to the antipsychotic. Ask patients if they nap during the day or just lie around, and if they want to do things but can't: * If they want to do things but feel too tired, this likely is sedation caused by the antipsychotic. Treatment might be a dose reduction. * If they are not interested in doing things, the likely cause is negative symptoms. Treatment might be a medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. * If they want to do things but cannot organize themselves to be able to do them, this likely is cognitive impairment. Treatment might be cognitive training or remediation. Efficacy and sedation Antipsychotics are thought to exert their effect by antagonism of postsynaptic dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2A receptors and possibly other receptors in the brain. Four SGAs--risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone--act as dopamine D2 and 5HT2A antagonists. Aripiprazole is a dopamine D2 partial agonist, serotonin 5HT1A partial agonist, and serotonin 5HT2A antagonist. (1) Efficacy data comparing SGAs with each other and with FGAs vary, but all 5 of these SGAs have been shown to be effective antipsychotics. (2-4) They also generally cause less sedation than FGAs. Patients with acute exacerbation of psychosis often have insomnia and frequently report paranoia that something will happen to them while they sleep. When treating agitated patients, many clinicians consider calming effects and true antipsychotic effects to be one in the same, which is not correct. All available antipsychotics are, on average, equally effective in treating acute psychotic symptoms but vary considerably in the amount of sedation they produce. Studies of short-acting injectable SGAs, such as ziprasidone and aripiprazole, have shown that agitation and acute symptoms can be controlled without significant sedation. (5,6) Antipsychotic effects are not immediate and historically were thought to occur over several weeks. …",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and frontotemporal dementias (FTD), are considered distinct entities, however, there is increasing evidence of an overlap from the clinical, pathological and genetic points of view.All neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by neuronal loss and death in specific areas of the brain, for example, hippocampus and cortex for AD, midbrain for PD, frontal and temporal lobes for FTD.Loss of neurons is a relatively late event in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases that is typically preceded by other events such as metabolic changes, synaptic dysfunction and loss, neurite retraction, and the appearance of other abnormalities, such as axonal transport defects.The brain's ability to compensate for these dysfunctions occurs over a long period of time and results in late clinical manifestation of symptoms, when successful pharmacological intervention is no longer feasible.Currently, diagnosis of AD, PD and different forms of dementia is based primarily on analysis of the patient's cognitive function.It is therefore important to find non-invasive diagnostic methods useful to detect neurodegenerative diseases during early, preferably asymptomatic stages, when a pharmacological intervention is still possible.Altered expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in many disease states, including neurodegeneration, and increasing relevance of miRNAs in biofluids in different pathologies has prompted the study of their possible application as neurodegenerative diseases biomarkers in order to identify new therapeutic targets.Here, we review what is known about the role of miRNAs OPEN ACCESSMolecules 2014, 19 6892 in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and the possibilities and challenges of using these small RNA molecules as a signature for neurodegenerative conditions.",

The development of cognitive activity is particularly affected by delayed mental development (DMD).* Especially characteristic of children with DMD is the uneven development of its individual aspects [4]. With respect to some parameters (level of cognitive activity, ability to exercise self-control), these children are considerably different from their normally developing peers; with respect to others (ability to understand instructions properly and hold them in their memory) they differ substantially from their mentally retarded peers.",

      "title": "Transient epileptic amnesia",
      "abstract": "Transient epileptic amnesia is an adult onset form of temporal epilepsy which is characterised by recurrent acute seizure-induced amnesia often accompanied by ongoing memory disturbances of autobiographical, topographical amnesia and accelerated long-term forgetting. The first case report of transient epileptic amnesia was described more than a hundred years ago. However, more extensively investigations of this type of epilepsy were started not long ago. In 1998 diagnostic criteria were formulated: 1) history of recurrent witnessed episodes of transient amnesia; 2) cognitive functions other than memory are judged to be intact during typical episodes by a reliable witness; 3) evidence for a diagnosis of epilepsy, provided by one or more of the following: (a) wake or sleep electroencephalography; (b) the co-occurrence of other seizure types (if their roughly concurrent onset and/or close association with episodes of transient amnesia suggested a connection); (c) a clear-cut response to anticonvulsant therapy. From case reports that are analysed in literature it is not difficult to summarise clinical characteristics: transient epileptic amnesia usually starts later in life, more often in men than in women; amnestic episodes are brief, recurrent and often occur upon waking; memory loss is usually mixed type with anterograde and retrograde amnesia; in 65% of patients amnesia is associated with gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, déjà vu, a brief period of unresponsiveness, automatisms; epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography were seen in 43% cases; although transient epileptic amnesia has an excellent response rate to anticonvulsant therapy, between episodes patients still suffer from accelerated long-term forgetting, remote memory impairment and topographical amnesia. Differential diagnostic of transient epileptic amnesia is diverse and diagnosis is usually inaccurate and overdue. Treatment with monotherapy often helps totally prevent recurrence of attacks. In the paper we review two case reports of patients with transient epileptic amnesia.",

      "abstract": "Delayed awakening from anaesthesia remains one of the biggest challenges that involve anaesthesiologists. Most commonly, delayed awakening is due to drugs effects persistence. 1 The time taken to emerge to fully consciousness is affected by patient factors, anaesthetic factors, duration of surgery and painful stimulation. Non pharmacological causes may have serious sequel; thus recognising these organic conditions is important. 2 Unexpected delayed emergence after the use of general anaesthesia has a plethora of causes. 3 The most common cause for delayed awakening following anaesthesia is medications and anaesthetic agents used in the perioperative period. There may be an over dose of medications. Emergence from anaesthesia depends on the tissue uptake of the drug, average concentration used and the duration of exposure. Certain underlying metabolic disorders such as hypoglycaemia, severe hyperglycaemia, electrolyte imbalance especially hyponatremia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, central cholinergic syndrome, chronic hypertension, liver disease, hypoalbuminemia, uraemia and severe hypothyroidism may also be responsible for delayed recovery after anaesthesia. Preoperative medications such as opioids and sedatives and hypothermia can further interfere with postoperative recovery. Intraoperative cerebral hypoxia, haemorrhage, embolism or thrombosis also can manifest as delayed awakening from anaesthesia. The ultimate goal of treatment is to find the cause and treat the cause, but primary management is to maintain airway, breathing and circulation.",

      "title": "Onset of psychiatric signs and impaired neurocognitive domains in inherited metabolic disorders: A case series",
      "abstract": "Abstract Inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) can present with psychiatric signs that vary widely from one disease to another. This picture is further complicated by the fact that these features occur at very different illness time points, which may further delay appropriate diagnosis and treatment. In this case series of 62 children and adolescents suffering from IMDs, we clustered psychiatric signs (on the basis of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders classification) as well as impaired cognitive domains (on the basis of the Research Domain Criteriamatrix) according to their mean age of onset (5.7 ± 4 years). We observed consistent patterns of occurrence across disorders. Externalizing symptoms, sleep problems, and cross‐domain self‐regulation deficits were found to precede the IMD diagnosis. Repetitive thoughts and behaviors as well as emotional dysregulation were found to occur around the disease onset. Finally, late‐onset features included dissociative or eating disorders, together with impaired emotion knowledge. Clinicians should specifically look for the co‐occurrence of age‐specific atypical signs, such as treatment resistance or worsening with psychotropic medication in the earliest stages and symptom fluctuation, confusion, catatonia, or isolated visual hallucinations. We believe that the combined characterizations of psychiatric signs and impaired neurocognitive domains may enable the earliest detection of IMDs and the appropriate care of these particular manifestations. Key Points Psychiatric signs are common in inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) and may occur in the same age‐range as other clinical manifestations. Three clusters of psychiatric signs and two clusters of neurocognitive domains can be defined according to their mean age of onset. Warning signs to be used in liaison psychiatry should include age‐specific cognitive impairments",

      "abstract": "In schizophrenia, the years before psychosis are morbid, not premorbid. Widespread, low-grade corruption of circuitry (brain damage) occurs, resulting in enduring deficits in cognitive, social, and motor functioning and motivation. These deficits persist during patients’ lifetime and do not respond to medication or talking. Expectations of patients’ functioning must be modified (reduced); interactions and environments must be accommodated to support best residual functioning, and prostheses (mechanical or actions of others) must replace functions no longer available. One of the deficits—anosognosia—interferes with treatment efforts. When the circuits managing dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area are corrupted, storms of dopamine imbue random items of sensory experience and intrapsychic life with salience—psychosis appears. Early and uninterrupted dopamine antagonist medication results in sustained remission of psychosis but is rarely achieved because of the inadequacies of standard care. Enduring engagement by multi-disciplinary teams is the necessary response to the neurobiology of schizophrenia.",

Acute insomnia lasts from 1 night to a few weeks. Chronic Insomnia - it happens at least 3 nights a week for 3 months or more. Insomnia may be a contributory factor in the development of a wide range of mental health problems. Primary causes of insomnia include stress due to a job loss or change in bad habits. A secondary cause of insomnia includes mental health issues like depression and anxiety, Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. Psychotic experiences commonly occur in mild forms and have been linked to disrupted sleep. Chronic insomnia higher rates in patients with comorbid conditions (e.g., hypertension, 44%; cardiac disease, 44.1%; breathing problems, 41.5%) it is glopally. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapeutic treatment; CBT for insomnia (CBTI) targets those behaviours, cognitions, and associations and is effective across a variety of populations, including those with medical and psychological comorbidities. CBT-I is a collaborative process and the skills learned in sessions require practice. The Society of Behavioural Sleep Medicine (www.behavioralsleep.org) and the American Board of Sleep Medicine also approved this type of treatment for Insomnia.",

The classic presentation is a tetrad of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. The exact cause remains unknown, but there is significant evidence that hypocretin deficiency plays an integral role. Some primary conditions that result in secondary narcolepsy include traumatic brain injury, congenital disorders, tumours, and strokes. Some medical and psychiatric disorders share characteristics of narcolepsy, at times leading to diagnostic inaccuracy. Other sleep disorders are commonly co-morbid. Diagnosis relies on patient history and objective data gathered from polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing. Treatment focuses on symptom relief through medication, education, and behavioural modification. Both classic pharmacological treatments as well as newer options have significant problems, especially because of side effects and abuse potential.

Behavioral therapy has been shown to be equivalent to or superior to pharmacologic therapy, at least in some patients. It is a reasonable initial approach, although there are barriers to its use. There are several pharmacologic agents available, some of which are more effective at reducing time to fall asleep and others for maintaining sleep.

After several months of discontinuation of the drug, major depression with psychotic features developed in one subject and a psychotic disorder in the other individual. No mental disorder preceded the use of ecstasy in any subject. Findings. A familial and personality vulnerability for mental disorder was revealed in one subject, but not in the other, and all physical, laboratory and cerebral NMR evaluations showed normal results in both patients. Remission of OCD and depressive episode or psychotic disorder was achieved after treatment with a serotoninergic medication associated with an antipsychotic. Conclusions. The heavy long-term use of ecstasy may induce an alteration in the brain balance between serotonin and dopamine, which might constitute a pathophysiological mechanism underlying the onset of obsessive-compulsive, depressive and psychotic symptoms. The heavy use of ecstasy probably interacted with a vulnerability to psychiatric disorder in one subject, whereas we cannot exclude that an “ecstasy disorder” ex novo affected the other individual.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Neuropathic pain, or pain associated with disease or injury to the peripheral or central nervous system, is a common symptom of a heterogeneous group of conditions, including diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, postherpetic neuralgia and spinal cord injury. Chronic neuropathic pain should not be thought of as a symptom. It should truly be thought of as a disease with a very complicated pathophysiology. Pathophysiology. The mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain are complex and involve both peripheral and central pathophysiologic phenomenon. The underlying dysfunction may involve deafferentation within the peripheral nervous system (e.g. neuropathy), deafferentation within the central nervous system (e.g. post-thalamic stroke) or an imbalance between the two (e.g. phantom limb pain). Clinical characteristics. Neuropathic pain is non-nociceptive, in contrast to acute nociceptive pain, and it can be described as ?burning?, ?electric?, ?tingling?, and ?shooting? in nature. Treatment. Rational polypharmacy is often necessary and actually it is almost always the rule. It would be an exception if a patient was completely satisfied with his treatment. Treatment goals should include understanding that our patients may need to be titrated and managed with more than one agent and one type of treatment. There should be the balance of safety, efficacy, and tolerability. Conclusion. There are many new agents and new applications of the existing agents being currently studied which will most certainly lead to even more improved ways of managing this very complicated set of disorders.",

      "abstract": "Recently described nonmotor fluctuations may cause disability in Parkinson's disease patients. These fluctuations are generally grouped as sensory, autonomic and psychiatric. The clinical spectrum and frequency of these fluctuating symptoms are not well-described.We studied the relationship of nonmotor fluctuations with motor symptoms and determined the influence of age at disease onset, duration of disease, dosage and duration of levodopa treatment in the appearance of nonmotor fluctuations.Statistical analysis showed a relationship of disease-related parameters with sensory and autonomic fluctuations but psychiatric fluctuations were only found to be associated with the duration of levodopa usage. The nonmotor fluctuations included in the study were observed during \"on\" periods as well as \"off' periods.Nonmotor fluctuations had variable presentations. Moreover, their co-appearance with different types of motor fluctuations may be linked to the effect of other neurotransmitter systems acting synchronously with dopamine. Risk factors for sensory and autonomic fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease were early age of disease onset, longer duration and higher dose of levodopa use. Psychiatric fluctuations were only associated with higher doses of levodopa.",

The list of possibilities spans virtually every major area of medicine, neurology and psychiatry. A clear, detailed history is invaluable in negotiating these numerous diagnostic considerations; however, the symptom may be expressed in terms that do not directly denote somnolence (e.g. `tiredness' or `fatigue'). Accurate diagnosis is important, not only because of the negative impacts of sleepiness and its root causes on health and social function, but because excessive sleepiness is generally remediable with appropriate treatment. As our understanding of the neurological underpinnings of alertness and sleepiness deepens, improved treatment methods are bound to emerge.",

There is, however, a marked decline in medication adherence in adolescence, which continues into adulthood, with less than 10% of adults with ADHD continuing to use medication. Moreover, psychosocial treatments too often do not continue to be used or adapted to new challenges. Thus, it is difficult to conclude what impact medication and/or psychosocial treatments would have on adult outcomes should these treatments be adhered to and applied continuously. As it stands, the lack of impact from treatments in childhood suggests that ADHD is a chronic condition, and that ongoing regular follow-up may be needed to offer patients interventions (medication and psychosocial treatment) that they require both to improve their symptoms in the short-term and promote more positive long-term outcome.",

In more than two-thirds of subjects who have dementia, at least one severe or repetitive mild traumatic event is reported before the onset of dementia.Depression onset may occur a few years preceding dementia diagnosis, and therefore, it could be prodromal or a risk factor (increases the risk of dementia by 1.65-fold in some instances",

Neuroleptics have the most support for efficacy, with shorter acting benzodiazepines demonstrating benefit on occasion. However, studies done to date indicate that these drugs are effective only for a minority of patients and that side effects frequently make patients worse. Other medications, such as propranolol, carbamazepine, or lithium, may be helpful, but their efficacy in dementia patients has not been demonstrated in placebo‐controlled studies. Until such studies are done, their use is most appropriate in special patient groups or in patients who have failed neuroleptic or benzodiazepine treatment. More studies are needed in elderly patients evaluating effectiveness of pharmacologic agents in specific types of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Most studies done to date have been of relatively short duration, usually two months or less. Because these medications often are given to dementia patients for prolonged periods, studies are needed to define the long‐term clinical efficacy of these agents. In the clinical setting, these agents should be reduced periodically or discontinued to determine ongoing need. In addition, environmental, social, or behavioral methods of reducing agitated behaviors need to be explored as an adjunct to any medication trial. J Am Geriatr Soc 34:368–376, 1986",

Recent research has suggested that both anatomic factors (acceleration-deceleration injury, contusions) and neurotransmitter factors (cholinergic systems) may contribute to the pathologic sequelae. Symptoms may be broadly categorized as physical, behavioral/affective, cognitive and integrative. Patients with mild brain injury may demonstrate significant attention and information-processing impairments in the absence of apparent neurologic problems. Most symptoms abate within the first few months, but a sizable subgroup of patients remain symptomatic up to one year or more. Evidence suggests that patients whose symptoms persist are not simply \"neurotic.\" Rehabilitation efforts should focus on proper evaluation, reassurance, education, support and monitoring of progress.",

Some types of epilepsy lead to mental retardation during development and with others the basic cerebral mechanisms for processing data are damaged and this may lead to transient or permanent cogniscitive deterioration.There are certain important clinical factors such as the site of the discharge regarding the lobe, hemisphere, type of cerebral area involved and the age of the patient. We describe the clinical features of each type of epilepsy with respect to focal or generalized involvement. The subclinical effects of continuous discharges affects processing in the areas involved and therefore intellectual function, thus leading to a secondary learning disorder. The neuropsychological tests used in investigation of higher cerebral functions in epilepsy include, in general, tests to assess speed of processing, attention, memory, reasoning and visuospacial ability and frontal executive functions.These tests should be sufficiently sensitive so as to detect minimal changes in the state of the illness, the time elapsed and the medication given. Anticonvulsant drugs may themselves cause changes in mental functions. There may often be mixed neurocognitive behaviour depending on the drug used. There may also be transient cognitive deterioration.",

Lifelong limitations of hand function with loss of sensibility, muscle weakness, prehensile problems, pain, and cold sensitivity are common. Recovery can take years in adults, especially of tactile discrimination, but often remains incomplete and quality of life may be significantly affected. Numerous factors influence the outcome: age, type of injury, timing of surgery, and cognitive capacity. In addition, education, sex, and post-traumatic stress have proved to be prognostic factors.

However, diagnosis is often complicated by concurrent multiple disorders (both psychiatric and medical/surgical), masking or distortion of symptoms, and communication impairments. Comorbidity and associated treatments should be considered in medication choice. Compared to psychiatric patients of normal IQ, patients with MR may be more sensitive to side effects and toxicity as well as responsive to lower doses, possibly related to less neuronal substrate, qualitative brain differences, or developmental stage. Unexpected or disappointing drug responses may also be related to such statistical quirks as \"end-of-curve\" phenomena. Ripples, ratcheting, and other ecobehavioral considerations influence treatment outcome and drug management. Target symptoms and expected drug benefits should be defined in consultation with caregivers as well as, when possible, the patient. Because drug responses of patients with MR are especially unpredictable, unreliable, sensitive to dose, and fraught with side effects, each medication trial might ideally be approached as a single-subject experiment on a compassionate protocol: quantify the baseline with ratings, behavior counts or other objective measures; start low and titrate slowly; monitor progress with repeated objective measures.",

Subcortical lesions occurred in both accidental and nonaccidental traumatic brain injuries. Traumatic brain injury severity (initial Glasgow Coma Scale or coma duration) was significantly associated with subcortical lesions. Long-term motor or visual deficiencies occurred in one third of patients and cognitive deficiencies in 52.1%. Although deficiencies occurred without visible MRI lesions, global outcome scores, motor delay, visual impairment, head growth slowing, global intellectual quotients, and planning performances were significantly worse in patients with subcortical lesions. An alarming deterioration in intellectual quotient over time was noted. It was concluded that neurodevelopmental outcomes are worrisome after severe traumatic brain injury in young children, and subcortical lesions affect the prognosis.",

Risk factors include previous episodes, dehydration, agitation, and the rate and route of neuroleptic administration. Although NMS has been reported in patients with diverse psychiatric diagnoses, as well as in normal subjects, patients with organic brain disorders or mood disorders, particularly when receiving lithium, may be at increased risk. Standardized criteria for the diagnosis of NMS have been developed and emphasize the classic findings of hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, mental status changes, and autonomic dysfunction. The syndrome lasts 7 to 10 days in uncomplicated cases receiving oral neuroleptics. Treatment consists primarily of early recognition, discontinuation of triggering drugs, management of fluid balance, temperature reduction, and monitoring for complications. Use of dopamine agonists or dantrolene or both should be considered and may be indicated in more severe, prolonged, or refractory cases. Electroconvulsive therapy has been used successfully in some cases and is particularly useful in the post-NMS patient. As a result of these measures, mortality from NMS has declined in recent years although fatalities still occur. Neuroleptics may be safely reintroduced in the management of the majority of patients recovered from an NMS episode, although a significant risk of recurrence does exist, dependent in part on time elapsed since recovery and dose or potency of neuroleptics used. Data drawn from clinical observations and basic studies support the primary role of an acute reduction in brain dopamine activity in the development of NMS. Additional studies of facilitating cofactors may lead to innovative risk-reduction strategies and the development of safer neuroleptic drugs.",

ADAM SULKOWSKI* The evidence for marihuana-induced brain atrophy [ 1] and \"amotivational syndrome\" [1,2] has not been convincing so far [3-8]. There are, however, some striking similarities between certain features of acute marihuana intoxication and the clinical syndromes of presenile and senile dementia (Alzheimer's disease). These similarities become puzzling and thought provoking when one compares the experimental psychological , neurophysiological, neuropathological, and pharmacological studies of these two, apparently so different, phenomena. Psychological studies of acute intoxication with marihuana of mild to moderate potency have shown no effects on sensory acuity and simple reaction time tests [9-11]. Psychogeriatric literature provides no evidence for motor and/or sensory deficits in early stages of Alzheimer's disease [12, 13]. Careful studies of attention, psychomotor speed, memory and learning in our laboratory [11, 14] have not shown marihuanainduced impairment except for the subjects' ability to use effectively already memorized task-relevant information. We called this deficit a failure in information processing. The same finding has been repeatedly described by many authors in the aged and demented populations [15, 16]. Another intriguing similarity is in self-evaluation regarding one's performance. Under the influence of marihuana—and in contrast to alcohol effects—people tend to perceive their performance as much worse than it is in reality (i.e., they overestimate impairment) and as the result they exercise considerable caution and restraint (Sulkowski, unpublished data). As a matter of fact, in real life, marihuana users are said to occasionally endanger safety by driving too slowly. One needs only to observe daily traffic to see how exasperatingly \"cautious\" elderly people can be. This age-related psychological characteristic has been dealt with extensively by psychologists of old age [17-19].»Bedford VA Medical Center GRECC, 200 Springs Road, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730 and Boston University School of Medicine.© 1980 by The University of Chicago. 0031-5982/80/2302-0139$01.00 Perspectives in Biology andMedicine · Winter 1980 \\ 209 A unique and reliable effect ofmarihuana is alteration in time perception which has been seen especially clearly in \"time production\" paradigm (e.g., a subject is asked to signal the limits of a 10-second interval of time) [14, 20, 21]. It has been speculated that the drug alters our internal psychological clock. Identical defects in this hypothetical clock have been described in the elderly and have been considered responsible for decrements on many behavioral tests [22, 23]. Some experts contend that the left (dominant) hemisphere functions are more affected by marihuana than the right (nondominant) hemisphere functions [24, 25]. This reportedly results in disinhibition of the right hemisphere and leads to an altered state of consciousness. Recently published neurological theories postulate that this interhemispheric imbalance is responsible for clinical symptoms of dementia [26]. Rigorous tests of these theories are difficult to design [27] and supportive experimental data are very scant. On the psychosocial (interpersonal) level marihuana produces a quiet detached withdrawal from social environment which might be an analogue of so-called gradual social disengagement typical of very old and demented individuals [28]. It is possible that the failure to actively process information when \"high\" reinforces marihuana use through the mechanism of negative reinforcement by protecting the user from stressful cognitive overload with multiple and contradictory messages typical of modern society. Neurophysiological data from EEG studies of marihuana's acute effects show nonspecific and generalized slowing of alpha rhythm and slight to moderate increase in amplitude [29, 30]. These also happen to be the most common findings in very old subjects and patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease [31, 32]. Psychophysiological theorists ofaging have provided some experimental data to support their theory of autonomic nervous system overarousal in the aged and demented [33, 34]. This hyperarousal has been held responsible for interoceptive sensory overload which in turn interfered with CNS adaptive functions. Powerful sympathetic activation is a characteristic and dose-related effect of marihuana. Difficulties with theoretical interpretation notwithstanding, the decrease in cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease has been well documented. Again, there are some preliminary data (L. Miller, personal communication) suggestive of diminished blood supply to the brain in intoxicated marihuana smokers. Pharmacologic studies seem to indicate...",

The age disorientated systematically under-estimate the present year and their duration of hospital stay; in individual patients the errors they make are consistent with their concept of their own age. \"Time stands still\" for these patients. However, there are patients in whom an incorrect appreciation of their own age co-exists with correct awareness of the present year. Between these patients and those for whom subjective time stands still, there appears to be a continuum of increasing temporal disorientation.

Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

In these patients, cognitive, mood, and emotional disturbances are commonly observed, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, and anger/aggression. The debilitating effect of TBI extends years after the initial injury and impairs the recovery process and patients' quality of life. Compared to other major neurological diseases such as stroke or degenerative diseases, TBI occurs relatively young. Therefore, patients have to endure the sequelae for a more extended period. Therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment of the cognitive–emotional symptoms are essential. Studies have been made to seek the pathogenesis of the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been underrecognized and understudied. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare. It has been suggested that the congitive and emotional sequelae are related to the \"remote\" effect of the initial brain injury rather than the initial pathology itself. This review will describe some of the most common or relevant poststroke mood and emotional disturbances. The phenomenology, factors or predictors, and relevant lesion locations will be described, and pharmacological treatment of these emotional disturbances will be discussed based on presumable pathophysiological mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "abstract": "What is the topic of this review? It provides an overview of the recent papers linking brain neurotransmission with exercise-induced and/or mental fatigue. What advances does it highlight? The noradrenergic neurotransmitter system hastens central fatigue during prolonged exercise, a finding that coincides with a faster rate of increase in the rating of perceived exertion. 2) Mental fatigue affects several neurotransmitter systems, with presumably an important role for dopamine and adenosine, in multiple brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex.In sports and exercise science, fatigue is an elusive concept that has important implications in performance during exercise. It has been described in many ways (tiredness, exhaustion, lethargy or weariness) and describes a physical and/or mental state of being tired and lack of energy. Exercise-induced fatigue can be defined as an acute impairment of exercise performance, and a distinction has been made between peripheral and central fatigue. Mental fatigue can be defined as a psychobiological state caused by prolonged exertion that has the potential to reduce cognitive performance and exercise performance. Recent studies have given clear indications that brain catecholamines are involved in the onset of fatigue during endurance exercise. Evidence is provided indicating that the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system hastens central fatigue, a finding that coincides with a faster rate of increase in the rating of perceived exertion. Brain neurotransmission is also suggested to play an important role in mental fatigue. Several neurotransmitter systems might be implicated (with the most important role for dopamine and adenosine) in multiple brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, and the summation of these alterations might explain the impairment in endurance performance in a mentally fatigued state. Obviously, we have to keep in mind that fatigue is a very complex construct and that, besides brain neurochemistry, several other factors play a role in its onset.",

      "abstract": "Acute neuromuscular paralysis (ANMP) is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapid onset muscle weakness progressing to maximum severity within several days to weeks (less than 4 wk). Bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness may or may not be present. It is a common neurological emergency which requires immediate and careful investigations to determine the etiology because accurate diagnosis has significant impact on therapy and prognosis. Respiratory failure caused by neuromuscular weakness is considered as more critical than lung disease because its development may be insidious or subtle until sudden decompensation leads to life threatening hypoxia. Also, the arterial blood gas finding of severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis may not be apparent until respiratory failure is profound. Hence, the requirement for respiratory assistance should also be intensively and promptly investigated in all patients with neuromuscular disease. The disorder is classified based on the site of defect in motor unit pathway, i.e., anterior horn cells, nerve root, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction or muscle. Identification of the cause is primarily based on a good medical history and detailed clinical examination supplemented with neurophysiologic investigations and sometimes few specific laboratory tests. Medical history and neurological examination should be focused on the onset, progression, pattern and severity of muscle weakness as well as cranial nerves testing and tests for autonomic dysfunction. Associated non neurological features like fever, rash or other skin lesions etc. should also be noted. Globally, Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most frequent cause of ANMP and accounts for the majority of cases of respiratory muscles weakness associated with neuromuscular disorders. Newly acquired neuromuscular weakness in intensive care unit patients consist of critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy and drug induced neuromuscular weakness which may arise as a consequence of sepsis, multi-organ failure, and exposure to certain medications like intravenous corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State",
      "abstract": "Consciousness is a multifaceted concept that has two dimensions: arousal, or wakefulness (i.e., level of consciousness), and awareness (i.e., content of consciousness) (Laureys et al., 2004).An accurate and reliable assessment of the arousal and awareness of consciousness in patients with severe brain damage is of greatest importance for the differential diagnosis of low levels consciousness patients and for outcome evaluation.Following coma, some patients permanently lose all brainstem function (brain death), some progress to \"wakeful unawareness\" (vegetative state -VS), whereas others recover typically and progress through different stages before fully or partly recovering consciousness (minimally conscious state -MCS).Patients in VS can open their eyes and exhibit basic orienting responses, but show no conscious, purposeful activity.Reflex and other movements are seen, mediated by brainstem, spinal cord, and brainstem-diencephalic arousal systems (Laureys et al., 2004).VS can occur after patients emerge from an acute catastrophic brain insult causing coma, or can also be seen in degenerative or congenital nervous system disorders.The two common findings are necrosis of the cerebral cortex, thalamus and brainstem (usually after anoxic injury) and diffuse axonal injury (usually after trauma), although other pathological findings can be seen in degenerative and other disorders (Laureys, 2008).The MCS patients do not meet diagnostic criteria for coma or VS because they demonstrate some inconsistent but clear evidence of consciousness (Laureys et al., 2008;Giacino et al., 2002).In the MCS, there is variable impaired function of the cerebral cortex, diencephalons and upper brainstem.This allows occasional conscious behaviours to occur, unlike in VS or coma.Patients may enter the MCS as they emerge from coma or VS, or they can become minimally conscious as a result of acute injury or chronic degenerative diseases.Recent studies suggest a number of potential clinical and rehabilitative applications of magnetic resonance (MR) techniques.Although bedside clinical examination remains the criterion standard for establishing diagnosis, MR may provide an adjunctive diagnostic role when behavioural findings are very limited or ambiguous.The future of diagnostic and prognostic assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) envisions a battery of neurobehavioral and neuroimaging techniques (such as structural and functional MR imaging (MRI and www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging -Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience 182 fMRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), fiber tracking, positron emission tomography (PET)) that serve as complementary clinical tools that may help differentiate the effects of underarousal, sensory impairment, motor dysfunction, and cognitive disturbance in the search for potential causes of behavioural unresponsiveness. Magnetic Resonance and Magnetization Transfer ImagingThe morphological MRI acquisitions usually include non-contrast-enhanced sagittal T1, axial diffusion, axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial T2-SE, coronal T2 sequences and a 3D T1-weighted volume acquisition.FLAIR and T2-SE sequences permit to detect brain edema, contusion, hematoma, herniation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus.T2 sequences are useful in detecting hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injuries (DAI).The total number of lesions detected by FLAIR and T2 are shown to be inversely correlated with Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of traumatic coma patients; while the 3D T1 sequence provides an opportunity to evaluate the brain atrophy during the follow up of these patients.A lot of studies performed on traumatic coma patients with conventional MRI showed that lesions of the pons, midbrain, and basal ganglia were predictive of poor outcome especially when they are bilateral.Despite their encouraging results, these studies fail to explain why some patients in VS or with long-term marked cognitive impairments have no or minimal lesions on conventional MRI examination.This raises the question of the lack of specificity and insufficient sensitivity of conventional MR sequences which fail to reveal lesions such as ischemic axonal injuries.Therefore, it is clear that morphological and conventional MRI alone cannot be considered as a reliable tool to assess consciousness disorders severity or to predict their evolution and outcome (Tshibanda et al., 2009).Several studies investigated patients in VS and in MCS using non-conventional, quantitative and volumetric MR techniques, useful to provide information about the anatomical patterns, the prognosis and the outcome of these patients.Ammermann et al. (2007) have used volumetric analysis of MRI to determine the pattern of lesions in 12 patients with a severe neurological impairment after acute ischemic injury.At the time of scanning, the patients were either in VS or in an early remising state, that is MCS.Lesions were classified as having been present in the gray and/or white matter in four different brain regions (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital).An additional separate evaluation was performed for the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem.The total clinical follow-up period of all patients from the time of the causative event lasted for at least 5 months.The clinical outcomes were reported according to the Rancho Los Amigos Cognitive Scale (RLACS) as a universal guide to assess a patient's level of functioning.The final RLACS levels were correlated to the MRI lesion size with a Spearman correlation.All patients demonstrated extensive white matter lesions, with the largest lesions observed in the frontal and occipital lobe.A preferential involvement of the white matter located in the periventricular area and in the subcortical regions below the motor and internal temporal cortices was found, in addition to the classifically described lesions of the striatum, motor and occipital cortices.Lesion magnitude showed an association with the severity of the outcome as quantitatively assessed by RLACS.With respect to gray matter lesions, the vulnerability pattern observed included frontal and occipital and in some cases parietal cortical areas, moreover in most cases the thalamus.Additionally, almost all of patients showed lesions of the hippocampus or lesions to the basal ganglia.An association between the extent of the MRI defined lesions located within the white matter and the clinical www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State 183 outcomes of the patients was found.All patients in the most unfavorable class III clinical outcome group (i.e.persistent VS) exhibited white matter lesions exceeding 2/3 of the volume of at least one lobe, most frequently the occipital lobe.Moreover, Juengling et al. ( 2005) investigated 5 patients in persistent VS due to prolonged cerebral hypoxia of non-traumatic origin, using combined Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) of 3D MRI and FDG-PET analysis.In the analysis of the regional distribution of gray matter atrophy, VBM revealed multiple areas of significantly decreased gray matter density at p<.001, corrected for multiple comparisons.Those were localized in multiple cortical areas, in particular including inferior parietal lobe, superior and medial frontal lobe, paracentral lobule, superior and medial temporal lobe, the cingulum, and the fusiform gyrus.Thalamic changes were limited to small voxel clusters in dorso-medial areas.These structural atrophic changes were compared with the local distribution of functional loss as assessed by regional hypometabolism in the FDG-PET group analysis.At the threshold pb0.001 (corrected for multiple comparisons), PET showed a widespread pattern of hypometabolic areas.In particular, the parietal and frontotemporal cortices, the cuneus/precuneus, the cingulum, the frontal medial and precentral gyrus, and the transverse temporal gyrus were involved, additionally the bilateral thalamus (mainly dorsomedial subnucleus).All changes were, similar to the VBM results, nearly symmetrical.Improved understanding of this complex lesion pattern gained by in vivo group analyses like here might help to provide deeper insights into the general pathoanatomy of patients in the persistent VS.Using high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and a novel approach to shape analysis applied SIENAX software, Fernandez-Espejo et al. ( 2010) investigated thalamic global and regional changes in a sample of patients in a VS or an MCS.They found that total thalamic volume was significantly lower in patients than in healthy volunteers.Shape analysis revealed significant bilateral regional atrophy in the dorso-medial body in patients compared to controls; this atrophy was more widespread in VS than in MCS patients.Lower thalamic volume was significantly correlated with worsening of Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores.Shape analysis suggested that the dorso-medial nucleus and the internal medullar lamina were the main regions responsible for this correlation.These findings suggest that MCS and VS patients present different patterns of regional thalamic abnormalities.In particular, VS patients showed a more widespread pattern of atrophy than controls, producing differences in global thalamic volume.MCS patients did not show volumetric differences compared to controls, and regionally they showed a less pronounced inward collapse in both the dorsal and ventral areas, with the anterior-ventral body significantly spared.Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that thalamic damage is less common in MCS than in VS patients (Jennett et al., 2001).Another quantitative RM technique is the Magnetization Transfer Imaging (MTI).The MTI relies on the principle that protons bound in structures exhibit T1 relaxation coupling with protons in the aqueous phase.When an off-resonance saturation pulse is applied, it selectively saturates those protons that are bound in macromolecules.These protons subsequently exchange longitudinal magnetization with free water protons, leading to a reduction in the detected signal intensity (Sinson et al., 2001).The MTI may provide a quantitative index of the structural integrity of tissue and might be useful to study the outcome of patients with low levels of consciousness.However, further studies, on larger groups of patients, need to be performed to confirm the usefulness of quantitative MRI in the assessment of the eventual neurological prognosis and outcome of these challenging patients.",

      "title": "Incidence and Correlates of Tardive Dyskinesia in First Episode of Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background:</h3> There is controversy over whether tardive dyskinesia (TD) is solely a consequence of antipsychotic drug treatment or in part may reflect an intrinsic aspect of the disease process. Pathophysiologic factors could, independently or in concert with drug effects, lead to the development of dyskinetic signs. <h3>Methods:</h3> We studied prospectively 118 patients in their first episode of psychosis who were treatment-naive or had less than 12 weeks of antipsychotic drug exposure at study entry. Patients received standardized antipsychotic drug treatment and were evaluated for up to 81/2 years with regular assessments of psychopathologic signs and symptoms and side effects. <h3>Results:</h3> The cumulative incidence of presumptive TD was 6.3% after 1 year of follow-up, 11.5% after 2 years, 13.7% after 3 years, and 17.5% after 4 years. Persistent TD had a cumulative incidence of 4.8% after 1 year, 7.2% after 2 years, and 15.6% after 4 years. Taken individually, both antipsychotic drug dose, entered as a time-dependent covariate, and poor response to treatment of the first psychotic episode were significant predicters of time to TD. When antipsychotic drug dose and treatment response were examined together, treatment responders had significantly lower hazards for presumptive TD than nonresponders (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.97). Dose was a trend-level predicter, with each 100-mg chlorpromazine equivalent unit increase in dose associated with a 5% increase in the hazard of presumptive TD (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.11). <h3>Conclusion:</h3> Poor response to the treatment of a first episode of psychosis and, to a lesser extent, antipsychotic drug dose are important factors in the development of TD. This suggests that there may be a disease-related vulnerability to TD manifest with antipsychotic drug exposure. Potential pathophysiologic factors might include neurodevelopmentally induced structural neuropathologic characteristics, sensitization of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, and the induction of glutamatergically mediated neurotoxic effects.",

      "title": "Phenomenology and psychiatric origin of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES) is a sudden change in a person's behavior, perception, thinking, or feeling that is usually time limited and resembles, or is mistaken for, epilepsy but does not have the characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that accompanies a true epileptic seizure [1]. It is considered that PNES is a somatic manifestation of mental distress, in response to a psychological conflict or other Stressors [2]. A wide spectrum of clinical presentation includes syncope, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, simple and complex partial seizure, myoclonic seizure, frontal lobe seizures and status epilepticus [3]. Coexistence of epilepsy and PNES is seen in approximately 9% of cases [5]. Between 25-30% of patients referred to tertiary centers and initially diagnosed as refractory epilepsy were on further examination diagnosed as PNES [6,7]. In DSM-IV [12] PNES are usually categorized under conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions. However, psychiatric basis of PNES may be anxiousness (panic attack), somatization or factitious disorder, simulation, dissociative disorders and psychosis [1]. AIM The aim of the study was to establish clinical phenomenology and EEG characteristics as well as basic psychiatric disorder in patients with PNES. METHOD In a retrospective study covering the period from January 1st 1999 till April 31 st 2003, 24 patients (22 female, 2 male) treated at the Institute of Neurology in Belgrade were analyzed. PNES were defined as sudden change in behavior incoherent with epileptiform activity registered on EEG. Possible PNES were determined on the basis of history data and clinical examination during the attack but definitive confirmation was established only by the finding of no ictal EEG changes during typical seizure of each patient. Patients with coexisting epilepsy were included in the study, too. At least two standard EEG (range 2-6, median 4) were performed at the beginning of diagnostic evaluation. Demographic data, clinical presentation (apparent loss of consciousness, type of convulsion and associated clinical signs) and placebo-induced seizures (administration of saline near the cubital vein) with EEG or video-EEG monitoring were analyzed. Basic psychiatric disorder was classified according to DSM IV classification criteria. RESULTS Duration of PNES was 4.7 years (range from 2 months to 30 years). The time from onset to the diagnosis of PNES was 4.5 years. Epilepsy comorbidity was diagnosed in 9 patients (37.5%). The average time of use of antiepileptic drugs (AED) in the group of isolated PNES was 2.4 years and 20% of patients were treated with two or more AED. The vast majority of patients presented with bilateral convulsions (54.16%) with apparent loss of consciousness found in 91.6% of cases. Ictal iwury (16.7%), tongue bite (4.2%) and premonition of the seizure (17.4%) were uncommon. Variability in clinical presentation of seizures was found in over half of patients (57%). Psychological trigger could be determined in over 60% of patients. EEG findings in a group with isolated PNES suggesting the existence of epileptiform activity was found in one case. EEG monitoring of placebo-induced seizure was performed in 20 patients, of whom 19 (95%) showed typical habitual attack with no electroclinical correlate. In 70% of cases conversion disorder DSM-IV criteria were fulfilled. Somatization disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder were found in 3 patients. The diagnosis of factitious disorder was made in one case and only two patients were undiagnosed according to DSM-IV. DISCUSSION Average delay from onset to diagnosis of PNES in larger studies was estimated to be approximately 7 years [8]. Even though diagnostic delay in our study was shorter, organizational reasons for this could not be found. Longer duration of a typical attack (compared to the epileptic seizure), apparent loss of consciousness, bilateral convulsion behavior and significant clinical variability in absence of typical epileptic elements such as tongue bite and ictal iwury could be the main clinical manifestation of PNES. We found rare interictal abnormalities (6.7%) in the group with isolated PNES and significant percentage (77.7%) in patients with coexisting epilepsy which is coherent with other reports [8]. The latest could lead to prolonged delay in appropriate diagnosis and suitable treatment. Clear psychological trigger wasn't noted in whole group of patients (61 %). This, however, is not unusual since PNES represents a chronic disorder with repeated triggering that could lead to less significant role of the same psychological trigger in developed PNES. Even insufficiently resolved in ethical terms, placebo-induced procedure was of huge sensitivity. In clinical practice conversion disorder is hard to differ from malingering or implementation of secondary gain. One could make the conclusion only on the basis of detailed and careful estimation of the symptoms developing context Conversion disorder is more prevalent among women (from 2:1 to 10:1) [4, 13] but modest percentage of affected men could be explained only by limited sample in this study. CONCLUSION PNES is often replaced with epilepsy and in number of cases clinical differentiation is not easy. One should be acquainted with clinical presentation of PNES as well as its psychiatric origin in order to adequately recognize and treat the disorder.",

Cognitive enhancers are being developed for other cognitive disorders. There are many advantages for development of symptomatic cognitive enhancers compared to disease-modifying agents. Cognitive enhancers typically modulate transmitter systems. Cross-disease phenotypes such as executive function impairment may represent a development strategy for cognitive enhancing agents.

      "abstract": "The adolescent period is a crucial time for brain development. Emotional skills mature, knowledge deepens, and coping skills develop. However, the development of depression during this period of life can have severe and potentially permanent effects on a person's life. The prevalence of adolescents with mental disorders, especially depression, has been steadily increasing. The diagnosis of depression is often accompanied by co-occurring, comorbid disorders (eg, psychosis, anxiety, conduct issues, and oppositional defiant behavior), addictive behaviors, and a preexisting or ongoing history of traumatic exposure. Untreated depression affects the ability to pursue education, to be consistently employed, and to have adequate physical health. Treatment options for depression in adolescents include pharmacological management and psychotherapy. Only two antidepressant agents (fluoxetine and escitalopram) are approved for treatment of depression in adolescents, with no approved augmentation agents. Psychotherapeutic interventions that include the family network show advantage over individual-centered therapy alone. Among individual-centered therapies, cognitive-behavioral interventions have the most support. A modular treatment approach with multifocus areas is the most effective, with shorter treatment duration and faster, more sustained symptomatic improvement. In cases of comorbid depression and substance use, treatment of substance use is usually not enough, so treatment of depressive symptoms is also necessary. Lastly, the contribution and impact of trauma in the genesis and perpetuation of depression cannot be emphasized enough, and successful treatment needs to address trauma antecedents and prioritize safety.

      "abstract": "develop schizophrenia and is generally not longer than a few years, with an average duration of about one year [7]. Thus it has been seen as a legitimate target for detection and intervention, with the aim of prevention of onset, or at least amelioration or delay of onset [8]. This is the background to the ‘ prodromal intervention ’ fi eld. However, even apparent prodromal symptoms lack specifi city. Characteristic prodromal features include sleep disturbance, irritability, lowered mood, anxiety and decline in school or work performance [7,9]. This clinical picture could be the result of a number of conditions, such as major depression, substance abuse and physical illness, as well as a psychotic prodrome. Even attenuated or isolated psychotic symptoms may not necessarily progress to a frank psychotic disorder, as these are now known to be quite common in the general population [10 – 14]. There are two implications of this lack of specifi city. First, is the recognition that a prodrome cannot be diagnosed as such prospectively, and that the terms ‘ prodrome ’ and ‘ prodromal ’ should not be used to refer to this clinical picture or those apparently presenting with it. This is more than pure semantics. Adoption of the term ‘ prodromal ’ to refer to individuals implies that they are on the path to schizophrenia. It suggests that the ‘ process ’ has already begun. Instead, as McGorry [15] has pointed out, terminology such as ‘ at risk mental state ’ should be used, to highlight that a person presenting with apparent prodromal symptoms may be at increased risk of onset of psychotic disorder within a brief time frame (1 – 2 years), but that onset is not inevitable. The second implication is that there needs to be some narrowing of the defi nition of ‘ at risk ’ so that those so identifi ed truly have a high likelihood of onset of fi rst episode psychosis within a brief period of time. One strategy to achieve this aim has been the development of the ultra high risk (UHR) criteria. These have been described elsewhere [8,16,17]. Essentially, there are three groups identifi ed: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms",

      "title": "Neuropathic pain: mechanisms and their clinical implications",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain can develop after nerve injury, when deleterious changes occur in injured neurons and along nociceptive and descending modulatory pathways in the central nervous system. The myriad neurotransmitters and other substances involved in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain also play a part in other neurobiological disorders. This might partly explain the high comorbidity rates for chronic pain, sleep disorders, and psychological conditions such as depression, and why drugs that are effective for one condition may benefit others. Neuropathic pain can be distinguished from non-neuropathic pain by two factors. Firstly, in neuropathic pain there is no transduction (conversion of a nociceptive stimulus into an electrical impulse). Secondly, the prognosis is worse: injury to major nerves is more likely than injury to non-nervous tissue to result in chronic pain. In addition, neuropathic pain tends to be more refractory than non-neuropathic pain to conventional analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. However, because of the considerable overlap between neuropathic and nociceptive pain in terms of mechanisms and treatment modalities, it might be more constructive to view these entities as different points on the same continuum. This review focuses on the mechanisms of neuropathic pain, with special emphasis on clinical implications.",

It may last from a few hours to some months or may be permanent. Up to half of patients, young and old, have POCD within the first week after surgery. Three months later, 10 to 15 percent of patients still have POCD. It's still unknown whether POCD results from some neurotoxic effect of anesthetic agents, or it simply reflects a preexisting cognitive (intellectual) problem in older adults. It has also been suggested that cognitive after-effects of surgery may result from an inflammatory process. The nature of the relationship is unclear; as multiple factors are likely involved. As the exact reasons are still not known, further research is needed to identify the patients and procedures at highest risk of POCD, and what steps can be taken to reduce that risk. Anesthesiologists should play a more active role in screening for reducing cognitive dysfunction before surgery.

These include family interventions, motivational interventions for substance misuse and for non-adherence to medication, cognitive remediation for neurocognitive deficits and cognitive-behavioural therapy for symptoms. Psychological interventions may explicitly target risk factors for poor outcome, such as substance use, or protective factors, such as adherence to medication, or be directed at specific symptoms or deficits. There is emerging evidence for efficacy of psychological treatments during, following and even prior to the first episode. Important areas for further study are how different treatment modalities can interact productively, and patient and carer preferences for treatment.

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

Over 75% of autopsied chronic alcoholics have significant brain damage and over 50% of detoxified alcoholics display some degree of learning and memory impairment. In clinical practice, it could be difficult to differentiate between the various syndromes associated with chronic alcohol use. Objectives The authors present the various syndromes associated with cognitive impairment induced by chronic alcohol use. Methods Review of the most recent literature with the following key words: alcoholism, differential diagnosis, cognitive impairment and dementia. Results Chronic alcohol use can cause dementia such as chronic subdural hematoma after head injury, hepatocerebral degeneration by cirrhosis and nutritional deficiencies. The thiamine deficiency can originate Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. If not properly treated, it can develop as a chronic amnesic syndrome known as Korsakoff's syndrome. It is characterized by episodic memory deficit with confabulations, involvement of semantic memory, nistagmus and ataxic gait. The Machiafava- Bignami disease is rare and usually diagnosed in alcoholics. The symptoms include dementia, muscle stiffness, seizures, dysphagia and less often coma. Finally, diagnostic criteria for alcoholic dementia include dementia diagnosis made at least 60 days after the last exposure to alcohol; minimum of 35 standard doses for men and 28 for women per week for more than 5 years and, ethanol abuse mean within 3 years after the onset of cognitive decline. Conclusions Although various syndromes present similarities, the clinicians should be aware of the different symptoms as the treatment may vary according to the pathology.",

Developmental memory disorders can result from genetic factors or genetic/environmental interactions which prevent the brain from developing normally; or from early-acquired brain lesions. Developmental memory problems are likely to resemble adult memory problems with respect to specific deficits in information processing that depend on dedicated brain structures where there is little scope for transfer of function, as may be true of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) (Bachevalier, this volume, Chapter 2).",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

Central nervous system hyperarousal, either as pre-existing and/or induced by psychiatric pathology and worsened by stressful events, as well as aging- and menopause-related physiological decline of sleep mechanisms appears to be at the core of this common sleep disorder. Finally, there is emerging evidence that the levels of physiologic hyperarousal are directly related to the degree of polysomnographically documented sleep disturbance in insomnia patients, suggesting that objective measures of sleep duration in insomnia may be a useful marker of the medical severity of the disorder.",

Result: Direct Head trauma is absent in the history of this case as the chief complaint and reason of admission to the hospital is the hip fracture complaint. The common manifestations are altered mental state and focal neurological deficit. At the time of diagnosis the neurological state is important because delirium might be misdiagnosed. Pharmaceutical care strategies for both delirium and SBD are implanted and the result shows that the treatment plan although it may improve the illness condition but associated with various risks. Some medications are interacting with others or contraindicated in concurrent diseases, medications used with no apparent current indication along with using inappropriately high or low medicine dosages or duplicate medication without monitoring adverse reactions of drugs. Conclusion: Effective and safe administration of medicines in elderly patients is essential.

      "title": "Study of Adverse drug reactions and its Mechanisms",
      "abstract": "An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an injury caused by taking medication. ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a drug or result from the combination of two or more drugs. The meaning of this term differs from the term because side effects can be beneficial as well as detrimental. The study of ADRs is the concern of the field known as pharmacovigilance. An adverse drug event (ADE) refers to any injury occurring at the time a drug is used, whether or not it is identified as a cause of the injury. An ADR is a special type of ADE in which a causative relationship can be shown. ADRs are only one type of medication-related harm, as harm can also be caused by omitting to take indicated medications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdverse drug reactions can be considered a form of toxicity; however, toxicity is most commonly applied to effects of overingestion (accidental or intentional) or to elevated blood levels or enhanced drug effects that occur during appropriate use (eg, when drug metabolism is temporarily inhibited by a disorder or another drug). For information on toxicity of specific drugs see the table Symptoms and Treatment of Specific Poisons. Side effect is an imprecise term often used to refer to a drug’s unintended effects that occur within the therapeutic range.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the US, 3 to 7% of all hospitalizations are due to adverse drug reactions. ADRs occur during 10 to 20% of hospitalizations; about 10 to 20% of these ADRs are severe. These statistics do not include the number of ADRs that occur in ambulatory and nursing home patients. Although the exact number of ADRs is not certain, ADRs represent a significant public health problem that is, for the most part, preventable.\r\n\r\nIncidence and severity of adverse drug reactions vary by patient characteristics (eg, age, sex, ethnicity, coexisting disorders, genetic or geographic factors) and by drug factors (eg, type of drug, administration route, treatment duration, dosage, bioavailability). Incidence is higher with advanced age and polypharmacy. ADRs are more severe among the elderly (see Drug-Related Problems in Older Adults), although age per se may not be the primary cause. The contribution of prescribing and adherence errors to the incidence of ADRs is unclear.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nClassification:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdverse drug reactions are usually classified as mild, moderate, severe, or lethal. Severe or lethal ADRs may be specifically mentioned in black box warnings in the physician prescribing information provided by the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nSymptoms and signs may manifest soon after the first dose or only after chronic use. They may obviously result from drug use or be too subtle to identify as drug-related. In the elderly, subtle ADRs can cause functional deterioration, changes in mental status, failure to thrive, loss of appetite, confusion, and depression.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMechanism:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe most common mechanism for an ADR is the augmented pharmacological action, which is the known, inherent pharmacologic effect of the drug and is dose related; example insulin given for diabetes may cause hypoglycemia.  A different mechanism of ADR is drug interaction which is a reaction between two or more drugs or between a drug and a food, beverage, or supplement.  When two drugs are used together, their effects can be additive, synergistic or antagonistic.  Photosensitivity is another mechanism of ADR which could be either phototoxic or photoallergic.  Additionally, selected drugs cause drug dependence which could be psychological or physical.  Some drugs cause intolerance which is a characteristic pharmacologic effect produced by an unusually small dose, so that the usual dose tends to induce a massive overaction.  Another mechanism is teratogenicity.  A teratogen acts by different mechanisms like folate antagonism, neural crest cell disruption, endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, vascular disruption, specific receptor or enzyme mediated teratogenesis. Example: Thalidomide has antiangiogenic actions which has been proposed to play a role in thalidomide teratogenesis.  Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are other mechanisms of ADRs.  Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the most common primary target for chemical carcinogen and for a single DNA polymerase, DNA damage can affect replication in different ways.  Finally, idiosyncratic reaction and drug hypersensitivity are largely unpredictable ADRs.  Affected people may have genetic differences in the way their body metabolizes or responds to drugs and this can occur even with smaller doses. Knowledge of the mechanism of ADRs can help to prevent or reduce these reactions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe FDA Adverse Event Reporting System In the United States, the primary adverse event reporting system is MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program. Health care professionals and consumers voluntarily report ADRs, ADEs, and medication errors for entry into the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The events are evaluated by clinical reviewers in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). This evaluation may lead to regulatory action by the FDA, including labeling changes, communicating new safety information to the public, restricting use of the drug, or removing the drug from the market. The FDA may also require Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS), which are plans that use risk minimization strategies beyond professional labelling to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks.",

Once these causes are excluded, many cases of acute or subacute autonomic failure may be attributed to autoimmunity targeting the autonomic nerves and/or ganglia. In addition to the time course of the symptoms, several clinical observations support this concept. Subacute autonomic failure may occur in association with known autoimmune neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome or acquired neuromyotonia, or may be associated with occult cancer (paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy). When subacute autonomic neuropathy occurs in isolation, the syndrome often follows a viral prodrome, has a monophasic course, and can be associated with elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and neuron-specific autoantibodies. Until recently, subacute idiopathic autonomic neuropathy was considered to be a pure autonomic variant of the Guillain–Barré syndrome, but recent evidence suggests that some cases, at least, may be due to a specific immune response to the α3-type neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in autonomic ganglia. Indeed, an animal model of autonomic failure has been induced by immunization against α3-type neuronal nicotinic AChR. The manifestations of autoimmune forms of peripheral autonomic failure are reviewed in this chapter with special consideration of autonomic dysfunction in cancer patients and the emerging experimental and laboratory evidence for specific autoantibodies in both cancer and non-cancer cases.",

      "abstract": "Although sleep is popularly conceptualized as a quiet state without movement, a variety of motor phenomena can occur during this time. With the aid of video-polysomnographic electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) monitoring, sleep-related movements can be directly observed. Movements can be described based on duration, amplitude, periodicity, and most importantly their predilection to disturb sleep or produce other undesirable consequences. Sleep-related movement disorders (SRMD) constitute a class of movements that are simple and usually stereotyped, and are associated with undesirable effects such as impaired sleep quantity or quality, and/or impairment in daytime functioning. Unlike parasomnias, they are not associated with sleep-related mentation and are not goaldirected. They may occur during the transition between sleep and waking, and vice versa, or during any sleep stages.",

      "abstract": "Patients undergoing or about to undergo electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are often afraid they will experience negative cognitive side-effects.To answer questions that patients and referring clinicians often ask about cognitive problems that can result from ECT.To discuss, on the basis of clinical perception and literature, the cognitive problems resulting from ECT.The cognitive problems resulting from ect are threefold: short-term postictal confusion (immediately after the treatment), anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia. A patient affected by anterograde amnesia, is temporarily less able to remember what he or she has experienced over a period of three months after treatment. The brain of a patient with retrograde amnesia is unable to retrieve or remember information or procedures 'saved' before the treatment took place. More specifically the patient with retrograde amnesia has three main types of problems: semantic memory problems (relating to facts), episodic memory problems (no longer able to retrieve memories concerning non-personal events), and procedural memory problems (no longer able to operate various devices). It is difficult to predict which patients will experience cognitive problems as a result from ect and to what extent. However, the problems are not intensified by maintenance treatment. Factual and autobiographical memory problems following ect-induced retrograde amnesia seems to have a more permanent character. According to the Dutch guidelines for ECT, cognitive side-effects need to be monitored. If patients are monitored before and after ect, they can be given a more targeted psycho-education and eventually a more targeted training course.We conclude that in clinical practice increasing attention is being given to ECT-related cognitive side-effects. Clearly, however, more consideration needs to be given to inter-individual variability. Cognitive monitoring is advisable because the course of the side-effects of ect must be followed and evaluated.",

      "title": "Improvement of negative symptoms: concepts, definition and assessment",
      "abstract": "The development of new medications for the treatment of schizophrenia is closely tied to the concept of the disorder and its characteristic symptoms. In recent years, the symptoms have been divided into two broad categories: positive and negative. Positive symptoms tend to command clinical attention and to be treatment-responsive, while negative symptoms are more insidious and disabling, but less spectacular. Negative symptoms, which are similar to the core symptoms of schizophrenia defined by Krapaelin and Bleuler, have not received much attention until recently because of concern about reliability. However, rating scales with good reliability are now available for use in clinical and neurobiological studies. Clinical drug trials are also meeting the challenge of documenting the response to carefully rated negative symptoms. In addition, they are exploring the effects of medication on negative symptoms that are primary rather than secondary to reduced extrapyramidal side effects, or of medication that lowers levels of depression or decreases the demoralizing effects of positive symptoms. One ideal strategy for identifying the effects of medication on primary negative symptoms is to study patients with high levels of negative symptoms and low levels of positive symptoms, who are in the early stages of the illness and have been given minimal treatment with classical neuroleptics. Such samples are highly informative, but difficult to collect. Alternatively, when all confounders cannot be eliminated, the effects of medication can be explored using statistical techniques to examine covariance",

Delirium can interfere dramatically with the recognition and control of other physical and psychological symptoms such as pain in later stages of illness. Delirium is one of the most common mental disorders encountered in general hospital practice. Delirium is highly prevalent in cancer and AIDS patients with advanced disease, particularly in the terminally ill patients in the last weeks of life, with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 88%.

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

      "abstract": "Late-life depression (LLD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia are clinically distinct yet interrelated disease constructs, wherein LLD can be a prodrome, risk factor, comorbidity, or consequence of MCI and dementia. There is considerable prevalence of depression in those with MCI or dementia, and vice versa, with maximum evidence in Alzheimer's disease. These intersections often form one of the most confusing aspects of psychogeriatric practice, leading to under-detection and mismanagement of depression, thus leading to incomplete recovery in most cases. This article focuses on this clinical ambiguity in daily practice, reviews the clinico-investigative pointers for the LLD–dementia intersection, and puts forward clinical and research recommendations in view of the available evidence. Although there is conflicting evidence regarding the cause–effect relationship between LLD, MCI, and dementia, it is likely that these constructs share some common pathological processes and are often associated with each other within a longitudinal clinical continuum. This is a linear yet complex bidirectional association: either the comorbid depression exaggerates preexisting cognitive deficits or chronic persistent depression eventually leads to major neurocognitive disorders, not to mention depression as a part of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, which often impairs quality of life and psychosocial morbidity. Thus, a comprehensive approach, including tailored history, neuropsychiatric examination, and relevant investigations, is necessary for assessing the differentials, with a sound clinical understanding being vital to the process. Depression, if suspected, must be treated adequately with longitudinal neuropsychological reviews. Future research warrants elucidating precision biomarkers unique to these clinicopathological entities.",

      "abstract": "As descriptors for the clinical course and treatment of depressive illness, terms such as response, remission, and recovery have evolved with our understanding of the disease, yet have been inconsistently applied as measures of outcome in clinical trials. Indeed, a wide variety of definitions may be found in contemporary study reports. This article reviews the breadth of definitions, the ways in which they affect interpretation of clinical study data, and their relationship to clinical practice. Therapeutic experience over the past decade indicates that remission is the optimal outcome of treatment, and patients said to have remitted generally are considered to be well. By some standards, however, patients may be considered in remission despite harboring one or two minor symptoms. The presence of residual symptoms, like continued functional or social impairment, is considered a strong predictor of relapse or recurrence. Wellness thus must be determined by symptom level, functional status, and increasingly (as our understanding of brain neurophysiology grows), the nature of pathophysiologic changes. The various factors that may predispose patients toward or away from a state of sustained recovery also are reviewed, helping to inform a concept of remission more consistent with true wellness. Defining such a target can serve to sharpen the focus of therapeutic intervention in the clinical environment. This dynamic is reinforced via the integration of current best therapeutic thinking in research settings, leading to clinical trials that more closely approximate an ideal, remission-focused treatment regimen.",

The population of people with co-occurring disorders is heterogeneous, and the prevalence of comorbidity differs by diagnostic group. One of the overarching issues in the area of comorbidity is the nature of the connection between psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders. The rapid development of technical advances in the neurosciences has led to a better understanding of the molecular biology, neurotransmitter systems, and neural circuitry involved in mental illness and substance use disorders. The authors discuss the neurobiological interface between substance use disorders and other psychiatric disorders with an emphasis on emerging data concerning four psychiatric disorders that commonly co-occur with substance use disorders: depression/ mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. Better understanding of the connection between substance use disorders and psychiatric disorders could have a profound effect on prevention and treatment.

Diagnostic criteria include: Presence of obsessions, compulsions or both Obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming or cause a lot of distress, or impair other aspects of life The symptoms are not caused by substance abuse or another medical condition The disorder is not better explained by symptoms of another mental disorder Zohar-Fineberg Obsessive Compulsive Screen is a questionnaire which helps with assessment of OCD. Main lines of treatment consist of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Pharmacotherapy relies primarily on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, while other medications include serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, clomipramine, neuroleptics and glutamate modifiers. Psychosurgery and neurostimulation both invasive and non-invasive, is reserved for treatment-resistant cases of OCD.",

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

      "abstract": "FOR MOST PARENTS their child's first convulsion is a dramatic, frightening event which demands immediate medical attention. The physician, on the other hand, may see the patient after recovery from the attack and may tend to minimize the severity of the situation and assume a wait-and-see attitude before investigation and treatment are initiated. The convulsion is a symptom that indicates a disturbance of cerebral neurones. This disturbance may be the result of underlying organic disease of the brain, either fixed or progressive, or it may be an indication of a functional disturbance related to a circulatory or metabolic disorder. The first attack may be so mild that the child is unaffected but subsequent attacks may be prolonged, or result in status epilepicus, and produce a mild or severe degree of mental impairment. There is considerable evidence to indicate that anoxia associated with convulsions can cause brain damage and for this reason every child who has had a convulsion should be investigated and, with rare exception, placed on prophylactic daily anticonvulsant medication when no specific treatable condition is discovered. EVALUATION The first step in the study of a child who has a convulsion is to document its occurrence. Anxious parents are, as a rule, poor witnesses. Despite this, every effort should be made to obtain a description of the seizure, particularly premonitory symptoms, loss of consciousness, convulsive movements, duration of the attack, and the state of the patient following the attack. In infants breath-holding spells may simulate convulsive seizures. In breath-holding spells there is always a precipitating factor, usually a slight injury or some emotional disturbance which results in violent crying, ending suddenly in respiratory apnea. The cyanosis in such attacks appears before the loss of consciousness and convulsive movements.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Cognitive dysfunction is prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), with deficits observed across several domains (e.g., executive function, memory, attention). While depression alone is disabling, patients with cognitive deficits typically experience greater functional impairments, poorer clinical recovery, and reduced quality of life. Consequently, it is imperative to elucidate recent advances in our understanding of the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MDD.Areas covered: This review spans psychological, physical, and pharmacological treatment approaches for cognitive dysfunction in depression. Where possible, the authors summarise where treatments have demonstrated efficacy in improving specific cognitive domains (e.g., attention), and highlight the differential mechanisms which underpin cognitive improvement. In addition, the roles of adjunctive cognitive treatments (e.g., exercise), and the possible side effects and drawbacks of specific treatments are explored.Expert opinion: Psychological treatments typically confer cognitive improvement alongside functional and/or clinical recovery; however, the efficacy of cognitive training and cognitive behavioral therapy to longitudinal cognitive improvement remains to be established. Recently developed pharmacological agents may improve cognition by reducing low-grade inflammation and promoting neurogenesis; however, the pro-cognitive effects of typical antidepressants are limited. Integrated approaches which emphasize cognitive recovery alongside clinical and functional improvement may be key to advancing patient outcomes.",

Even in cases where a patient presents with a known medical condition, functional or somatic symptoms may complicate the diagnostic and treatment processes and prognostic outcome.

Symptoms may include weakness and/or paralysis, movement disorders, non-epileptic seizures, speech or visual impairment, swallowing difficulty, sensory disturbances, or cognitive symptoms (1). While FND presents as neuropsychiatric, providers commonly report feeling hesitant to diagnose these disorders. Inexperience or lack of appropriate education on relevant research regarding evidence-based practices or standard of practice (SOP) may result in over- or underperforming diagnostic workups and consultations, utilizing inappropriate medications, and failing to offer evidence-based psychological interventions.

Since limb weakness or hemiplegia can also be a common symptom of an acute ischemic stroke, it is often difficult to diagnose Todd's paralysis in individuals experiencing an acute ischemic stroke if they do not have a pre-existing history of epilepsy. Given that there is a limited understanding of Todd's paralysis, this review discusses the history, prevalence, clinical manifestations, duration, etiology, and diagnosis of Todd's paralysis. A few factors that may help clinicians distinguish Todd's paralysis from other clinical indications are as follows: (1) Todd's paralysis is commonly observed after partial seizures or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. (2) The incidence of Todd's paralysis is greater if the epilepsy is associated with old age or stroke history. (3) The duration of Todd's paralysis can range from minutes to days, depending on the type of seizure or whether the patient has experienced cortical structural damage. (4) The etiology of Todd's paralysis is associated with cerebral perfusion abnormality after seizures. Further research is needed to explore factors that distinguish Todd's paralysis from other indications that may lead to limb weakness in order to improve the diagnosis of Todd's paralysis.",

      "abstract": "Stress--that is, any type of stimulus that challenges the organism's normal internal balance--induces a physiologic response involving a variety of hormones and other signaling molecules that act on, among other organs, the brain. This stress response also can influence the progression of alcohol and other drug (AOD) addiction through various stages. For example, AODs can directly activate the stress response. In turn, certain stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and corticotrophin-releasing factor) also act on the brain system that mediates the rewarding experiences associated with AOD use (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system). Moreover, elevated glucocorticoid levels and stress increase AOD self-administration in certain animal models. During a later stage of the addiction process, in contrast, excessive and/or prolonged stress may impair the reward system, inducing heavier AOD use to maintain the rewarding experience. During the final stage of addiction, when the addicted person experiences withdrawal symptoms if no drug is consumed, chronic AOD use results in gross impairment of the normal stress response and other signaling mechanisms in the brain, resulting in a state of anxiety and internal stress. At this stage, people continue to use AODs mainly to relieve this negative-affect state.",

      "title": "Not the Function of Eating, but Spontaneous Activity and Energy Expenditure, Reflected in “Restlessness” and a “Drive for Activity” Appear to Be Dysregulated in Anorexia Nervosa: Treatment Implications",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is uncommon as a syndrome, despite widespread dieting or voluntary food restriction, especially among female adolescents. This suggests that restriction of caloric intake might not be the only component driving weight loss in AN. Historical observations and experimental evidence from energy expenditure studies and recordings from movement sensors reviewed in this paper reveal that AN is associated with motor activity levels and with an energy output not significantly different from that in normal-weight healthy age-matched controls. By contrast, other conditions of prolonged caloric under-nutrition are typically associated with loss of energy, slowing of movements and a decrease in self-initiated activity and well being. Several hypotheses can be inferred from the findings : a) that long term severe caloric restriction fails in downregulating movements and energy expenditure in AN. b) Clinically and subjectively observable as mental and physical restlessness and continued motor activity, this restless energy, differering in intensity, seems to serve as the permissive factor for and possibly to drive exercise and hyperactivity in AN. c) Such restless energy and increased arousal, generated sometime in the course of the weight loss process, appear to enhance the person's self -perception and wellbeing, to heighten proprioception, to intensify body awareness and to improve self-esteem. d) Restlessness and continued motor activity may constitute a phenotype of AN. The therapeutic value of the concept of an abnormality in the energy regulatory system, likely the result of a host of genetic and epigenetic changes in AN, lies primarily in its heuristic and explanatory power and its potential for disease prevention. Restless energy as a permissive and important component for the development and in the maintenance of AN, does not fundamentally alter treatment, since prolonged food deprivation is the principal causal factor for the development of AN. Renutrition within a structured treatment plan, to include individual and family therapy remains the most effective symptomatic treatment for AN. Corroboration of the concept of restless activation will require the patient's cooperation and input to identify and capture more precisely the experiences, sensations and changes that allow the emaciated patient to remain mobile and active.",

      "abstract": "Certains événements sont mieux mémorisés dans un contexte de stress. En effet, les mécanismes engagés par le stress facilitent la formation de la mémoire, mais ils peuvent aussi la détruire. C’est une des difficultés auxquelles se heurtent les stratégies d’identification de cibles médicamenteuses favorisant ou inhibant les effets mnémoniques des glucocorticoïdes. L’imagerie in vivo offre une vision nouvelle des bases structurales de la mémoire pendant les phases d’apprentissage et de la consolidation. La survie des traces de la mémoire dépend de la dose et du rythme d’exposition aux glucocorticoïdes. Ainsi, des rythmes biologiques de glucocorticoïdes anormalement haut ou bas peuvent endommager la plasticité des réseaux neuronaux nécessaires à la formation et à la consolidation de la mémoire. Ces découvertes offrent de nouvelles perspectives de travail pour mieux comprendre le développement de troubles mnésiques et de maladies neuropsychiatriques, telles que la dépression, qui se développent dans un contexte de stress.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Antiseizure medications (ASMs) can be associated with idiosyncratic reactions: rare but serious effects that cannot be predicted by their mechanisms of action or metabolic pathways. Apart from drug rashes (discussed in the previous chapter), these idiosyncratic reactions can include hepatic, pancreatic, hematologic, neurologic, immunologic, or central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. These reactions can be unpredictable, but when they do occur, these typically arise within weeks of drug initiation and may be reversed when the drug is stopped. The management of idiosyncratic reactions depends on the manifestations and severity. Potentially life-threatening reactions warrant rapid drug discontinuation, with initiation of an alternative ASM with little cross-reactivity to prevent seizures. Other reactions can be managed with slower substitutions or with the addition of other drugs.",

Delirium is an acute mental status change that is characterized by a disorder of attention and cognitive function that is typically a consequence of a medical condition. Despite differences in terminology, there are many other reasons that delirium is insufficiently diagnosed, and this is more pronounced in older adults. Coexisting dementia combined with lack of understanding of baseline mental status by healthcare providers may lead to assumptions that symptoms related to delirium are normal. Delirium is commonly missed in clinical practice, and so familiarity of the key features is extremely important. Patients with delirium may have lethargy or decreased arousal, while others may be hyperalert or hypervigilant. Medications are a leading cause of delirium, especially in older adults. Older patients are often on multiple medications and are typically more at risk for adverse effects from medications.",

Onset is insidious, idiopathic, and hastened by neurological incident or infection. Typically, the initial onset occurs during the teen years or after the second decade, although cases have been documented in early childhood, adulthood, and senescence. KLS is marked by unexpected debilitating, yet reversible, episodic hypersomnia, with varying recurrence rates; cognitive and behavioral impairment; compulsive eating; and feelings of derealization, hypersexuality, apathy, and depressed mood. Diagnosis is problematic due to the syndrome's rarity, disparity of presenting clinical symptoms, and misdiagnosis. Correct diagnosis can take up to 4 years. The clinical course is approximately 8 to 14 years from initial onset, yet may be longer in the adult form of the disorder. KLS has been shown to impact activities of daily living, usurping an adolescent of his/her social relations with peers, experiences, and time.

Compliance with treatment may be irregular in a variable number of patients. Factors such as age, education, complexity of posology, stage of disease, disease comprehension, cognitive function, or family support significantly influence compliance either in a positive or negative way. The consequences of noncompliance include withdrawal symptoms, increase in number of admissions, or, in severe cases, hyperthermia syndrome secondary to levodopa deficit in the case of infradose. In situations of overdose, dyskinesia or psychiatric complications may arise. The ideal treatment should have the potency of levodopa but not its side effects, act on striatal D2 receptors in a continuous way with a single dose and have low potential of addiction. Thus far, simple regimens are only applicable in early stages.",

The incidence of the syndrome in cosanguinous relatives suggests that it is hereditary.(4) Adrenal cortical insufficiency must be differentiated from muscular dystrophy, disease of a psychic basis, chronic brucellosis etc. A positive blood culture is necessary before the latter can be diagnosed.(11) (11A) Bacteriological cure can leave hypoadrenocorticism even if its existence prior to infection did not render the patient susceptible through immunity failure.(9) Present methods of treatment would yield greater success if endocrine homeostasis could simultaneously be achieved through carbohydrate withdrawal combined with the other measures described.

      "abstract": "The long-term prognosis for epileptics vary from an entirely normal life to early death or complete incapacity. Studies to date have not provided clear answers on the long-term sequelae of epilepsy. This is because there are many epileptic syndromes with different outcomes. Most studies include a heterogeneous group of patients who may not be representative of all the epileptics in the community. The prognosis for permanent remission of seizure varies with the seizure type. In childhood epilepsies, overall there is at least 50% chance of permanent remission. The more seizures the patient has had before anticonvulsants were started, the more difficult it is to control the seizures, the poorer the prospects for remission. Other unfavourable signs include partial seizures, multiple seizure types, mental retardation, neurological deficits and underlying brain lesion. The effect of seizures on intellectual development is controversial. Actual regression in children with epilepsy is rare except where the seizures are caused by a progressive pathology. However, in a significant proportion of children, intellectual development slows down after the onset of seizures. This is more likely to occur in children with severe seizures, and those on multiple anticonvulsants and with frequent toxic levels. Children with epilepsy have an increased likelihood of developing behavioural, emotional and psychiatric problems. The underlying neurological dysfunction, anxiety about losing control of oneself at any time, reaction of parents, friends and teachers to the condition and side effects of anticonvulsants all contribute to the psychopathology. In conclusion, the long-term sequelae of epilepsy are multiple and serious. Some of the causal factors are known and preventable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The severity of impairment and the variety of symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders or with particular epilepsy syndromes reflect focal or global, structural or functional dysfunction of neuronal networks. The complex relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy is secondary to common factors that include genetics, cognition, motor and language function. The epileptic encephalopathies are associated with regression or slowing of cognitive, language or behavior and the accepted working hypothesis is that this is a direct consequence of the seizures or of the interictal epileptiform activity, as opposed to the associated medical condition. The evidence that recurrent seizures or abnormal electrical activity can cause specific cognitive, language or behavioral abnormalities even in accepted epileptic encephalopathies is still controversial. Data from animal studies and the clinical experience from epileptic encephalopathies of early life imply that there are developmental time windows crucial to the type of epilepsy syndrome and to cognitive and behavioral outcome.The management of children in whom a neurodevelopmental disorder coexists with epilepsy is a difficult problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the epilepsy and the specific cognitive or behavioral problem and is tailored to the needs of the individual child.",

Studies addressing the benefit of depression maintenance treatment began appearing approximately 35 years ago. Most studies were limited in number of participants, relatively short observation periods (few studies reach >2 years), minimal monitoring of adherence, and polypharmacy. There is a paucity of head-to-head studies that compare medication, combination studies of psychotherapy and medications, or studies of neuromodulation modalities. Despite methodological shortcomings, there is consistent and robust evidence that maintenance therapy for recurrent depression at least halves the recurrence of depressive episodes over a 2-year follow-up period and potentially longer. Modest but growing evidence indicates that specific psychotherapies may prevent recurrences for mild-to-moderate depression and that combination treatment of antidepressants and psychotherapy may provide optimal results. Data remain inconclusive for newer neuromodulation treatments. Factors that support the need for maintenance treatment include a history of previous episodes, early onset, positive family history, high severity of the previous episodes, and possibly a history of prompt recurrence following previous discontinuation.",

Clinical experience shows specific situations where it is likely that there is some confusion of terms. We could erroneously understand as palliative sedation the cases of symptomatic treatment of hyperactive delirium in a patient in its last days (a situation that sometimes is presented as the first cause of palliative sedation) or those in which it is carried out a progressive increase in the palliative treatment that often have a sedative effect, parallel to the increased severity of symptoms because of disease progression in severe ill patients.

The objective of the present article is to review recent pharmacological treatments for apathy in neurodegenerative disorders. The Pubmed database was searched with a particular focus on articles published as of January 2017. Current main levels of evidence have been reported so far with cholinergic, glutamatergic and dopaminergic agents to reduce levels of apathy, despite several conflicting results. Treatment duration and samples sizes may have however decreased the validity of previous results. Ongoing studies involving more participants/treatment duration or distinct neural pathways may provide new insights in the treatment of apathy in neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

Some patients experience seizures, which may increase in severity with subsequent AW episodes. Another potential AW complication is delirium tremens, characterized by hallucinations, mental confusion, and disorientation. Cognitive impairment and delirium may lead to a chronic memory disorder (i.e., Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome). Psychiatric problems associated with withdrawal include anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. In addition, alterations in physiology, mood, and behavior may persist after acute withdrawal has subsided, motivating relapse to heavy drinking. Recent advances in neurobiology may support the development of improved medications to decrease the risk of AW complications and support long-term sobriety.",

Patients with Korsakoff's syndrome differed from the other patients by (a) failing to exhibit release from proactive interference, and (b) being disproportionately impaired in the ability to make judgments about the temporal order of recent events. These deficits appear to be related to frontal lobe damage and are superimposed on a more basic memory disorder. Theories of amnesia should be founded on the basic memory disorder and not on deficits such as these, which have no obligatory relationship to amnesia. Dissociations between aspects of memory, revealed by the study of amnesia, can also shed light on the organization of memory in the brain.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Critically ill patients have a high risk of developing neurologic dysfunction including delirium and long-term cognitive impairment. In this paper we examine possible relationships between delirium and long-term cognitive impairments and explore this in the context of critical illness. Recent findings Critical illness and its treatment can lead to neurologic morbidity including neuropathological abnormalities, delirium, and cognitive impairments. The association between delirium and long-term cognitive impairments has been shown in a number of populations. Among intensive care unit cohorts, delirium appears to be one of many possible causes of cognitive impairments and may be a leading modifiable cause. The mechanisms of both delirium and intensive care unit related cognitive impairment remain unclear, although a variety of common mechanisms have been proposed. Summary Potential neurologic consequences of critical illness include delirium and long-term cognitive impairments. Defining the extent of their association in intensive care unit cohorts is an important research priority due to the high prevalence of delirium and persistent cognitive impairments in critically ill patients. Future research should focus on strategies for the early identification of delirium and cognitive impairments, elucidating mechanisms of brain injury, and the development and implementation of therapeutic modalities designed to prevent or decrease delirium and cognitive morbidity.",

      "abstract": "Pathological gambling is classified as a disorder of impulse control, though many of its diagnostic criteria parallel those found in substance use disorders. A number of unitary and complex biopsychosocial conceptual models have been postulated to account for the multifactorial nature of gambling pathology. These models have implications for varied treatment approaches in the management of pathological gambling. Recovery is a diffused concept that has been variously and inconsistently determined by the remission or absence of clinical symptoms, the absence of diagnostic criteria, or the achievement of personal development, independence, and function. The lack of conceptual clarity and definitional precision make it difficult to ascertain the actual efficacy of interventions or their relative effectiveness when compared to similar treatments in different population settings or to different treatment approaches. Future investigations should clearly conceptualize the concept of recovery to evaluate the nature and extent of improvement along a spectrum that includes measurement of (a) decreases in frequency of and the time spent gambling, (b) abstinence or controlled gambling that meets financial obligations, (c) absence of symptoms of impaired control and cross-addicted behaviors, and (d) absence of negative consequences and improved quality of life over time.",

      "abstract": "Background and objective The extent to which deep brain stimulation (DBS) can improve quality of life may be perceived as a permanent trade-off between neurological improvements and complications of therapy, comorbidities, and disease progression. Patients and methods We retrospectively investigated 123 consecutive and non-preselected patients. Indications for DBS surgery were Parkinson's disease (82), dystonia (18), tremor of different etiology (21), Huntington's disease (1) and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (1). AEs were defined as any untoward clinical occurrence, sign or patient complaint or unintended disease if related or unrelated to the surgical procedures, implanted devices or ongoing DBS therapy. Results Over a mean/median follow-up period of 4.7 years (578 patient-years) 433 AEs were recorded in 106 of 123 patients (86.2%). There was no mortality or persistent morbidity from the surgical procedure. All serious adverse events (SAEs) that occurred within 4 weeks of surgery were reversible. Neurological AEs (193 in 85 patients) and psychiatric AEs (78 in 48 patients) were documented most frequently. AEs in 4 patients (suicide under GPI stimulation, weight gain >20 kg, impairment of gait and speech, cognitive decline >2 years following surgery) were severe or worse, at least possibly related to DBS and non reversible. In PD 23.1% of the STN-stimulated patients experienced non-reversible (or unknown reversibility) AEs that were at least possibly related to DBS in the form of impaired speech or gait, depression, weight gain, cognitive disturbances or urinary incontinence (severity was mild or moderate in 15 of 18 patients). Age and Hoehn&Yahr stage of STN-simulated PD patients, but not preoperative motor impairment or response to levodopa, showed a weak correlation (r = 0.24 and 0.22, respectively) with the number of AEs. Conclusions DBS-related AEs that were severe or worse and non-reversible were only observed in PD (4 of 82 patients; 4.9%), but not in other diseases. PD patients exhibited a significant risk for non-severe AEs most of which also represented preexisting and progressive axial and non-motor symptoms of PD. Mild gait and/or speech disturbances were rather frequent complaints under VIM stimulation. GPI stimulation for dystonia could be applied with negligible DBS-related side effects.",

      "abstract": "A close relationship seems to exist both clinically and psychopathologically between impairment of consciousness and its consequence in memory function-circumscribed amnesia-and the amnestic or Korsakow syndrome. In many cases an amnestic syndrome develops out of conditions of loss or impairment of consciousness or it initiates a clinical course which leads to impairment or loss of consciousness and eventually even to death. Although in such cases the amnestic syndrome is usually of short duration, numerically they seem to be more frequent than the chronic symptomatologically unchanging cases which one sees in alcoholics and seniles. Psychopathologically amnesia represents an unselective loss of memory for a limited period of time, due to lack or impairment of perceptual awareness. The amnestic syndrome on the other hand represents a selective type of memory dysfunction whereby recent personal memories cannot be recalled. It seems to be due to impairment of an integrative function other than perceptual awareness namely awareness of the personal meaning of events which is necessary for the registration of events as personal experiences available for future recall. Intact perceptual awareness is an essential pre-requisite for awareness of personal meaning but the latter is also dependent on the emotional charge of the situation. Consequently lesions and processes involving those structures of the brain functionally responsible for perceptual awareness and/or for emotional functions may be expected to lead to an amnestic syndrome. This is born out by neuropathological findings which demonstrate pathological changes in the hypothalamus in cases with impairment of consciousness and in the mammillary bodies with Korsakow's syndrome. The mammillary bodies form part of the activating system responsible for conscious perceptual awareness as well as of Papez' harmonious mechanism of the emotions.",

      "title": "Mirtazapine in Primary Insomnia: Case report and Literature review",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or achieving restorative sleep, despite adequate opportunities. This condition often results in significant daytime impairments, including fatigue, concentration difficulties, and irritability. Insomnia can be primary or comorbid with other disorders such as anxiety or depression. Case Presentation: A 27-year-old woman presented with severe and chronic insomnia, persisting for 14 years with recent exacerbation. Her symptoms included significant difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in an average of only 3-4 hours of sleep per night and complete sleep deprivation for periods exceeding half an hour over the past 5 days. This sleep deficit led to pronounced emotional instability, physical discomfort, and reduced appetite, although suicidal ideation was absent. She had a past history of drug use for different psychiatric illnesses. She was started on mirtazipine 30mg and showed abrupt improvement in her symptoms. She was discharged afterwards. Discussion: The patient's chronic insomnia and its secondary effects necessitate a comprehensive treatment approach. Mirtazapine, an antidepressant with potent histamine receptor antagonism, has shown efficacy in improving sleep quality across diverse patient profiles. However, side effects like weight gain and sedation require careful monitoring. Combining mirtazapine with prolonged-release melatonin has demonstrated enhanced outcomes, particularly in perimenopausal women. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) remains the first-line treatment due to its efficacy and long-term benefits. Conclusion: Mirtazapine can be a valuable option in the therapeutic arsenal for primary insomnia, but ongoing research is needed to refine treatment strategies. Personalized treatment plans considering patient history and response are crucial for effectively managing primary insomnia and improving patient outcomes.",

All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "Background: Drinking more than the recommended limits is a worldwide emerging problem, difficult to circumscribe, and alcohol-related brain damages are an under-recognized health problem. Alcohol-cognitive disruption can be considered as transient and recoverable if the alcohol consumption is limited and occasional; if not, it can progress to the so-called Alcohol-Related Dementia (ARD), or to the Wernicke encephalopathy, or it can even induce the Korsakoff syndrome, an irreversible and long-lasting medical condition. ARD still remains poorly diagnosed and addressed, despite having increased research interest being a frustrating condition, a relatively non-progressive, or even partially reversible condition in abstinent ex-drinkers. On the contrary, Wernicke encephalopathy, with its neurological symptoms (ocular coordination imbalance and gait ataxia), is a dramatic medical condition, potentially lethal which can lead towards Korsakoff dementia. The alcohol consumption is a strong reinforcing condition of the thiamine deficit, the main biochemical determinant factor that starts the cascade of the brain irreversible damaging events. Conclusion: Our review focuses on the possible common neural pathways of this three condition, on the biochemical basis of the damages, and tries to underline the strong need of better understanding the pathogenesis of the brain lesions, including epigenetics and the nutritional aspects of the problem. Keywords: Alcohol consumption, alcohol-related dementia, Wernicke encephalopathy, Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine, epigenetics.",

Junto al abuso tambien se encuentra un cierto grado de de uso. No se pueden definir sus limites basandose en el tiempo o en las cantidades consumidas. Muchas veces no queda mas remedio que incluir al paciente en una de esas categorias, empleando criterios subjetivos, ya que los casos intermedios son muy corrientes. Dentro del grupo de los dependientes pueden delimitarse diferentes tipos de adiccion (WHO), segun la existencia de dependencia fisica o psiquica.\nLa dependencia de la heroina se define desde la novena revision de la ICD como forma de dependencia a farmacos y drogas.\nSegun esta definicion, la dependencia (antiguamente adiccion) es un estadio principalmente psiquico al que puede asociarse simultaneamente tambien una dependencia fisica, frecuentemente relacionada con la aparicion de tolerancia. Es necesario llamar la atencion sobre este hecho, ya que muchas veces se cre que la dependencia supone en todas los casos una dependencia fisica unida a la necesidad de aumentar la dosis de la droga. Por el contrario, a veces se descarta erroneamente la existencia de dependencia cuando no se observa un incremento en la dosificacion. \nSe ha descrito ademas una serie de trastornos que aumentan la necesidad de administrarse el medicamento o la droga independientemente del tiempo de evolucion de la dependencia. Uno de los factores esenciales que determina esta compulsion es la aparicion de sensaciones desagradables (disforia) cuando no se administra el farmaco o la droga.",

      "abstract": "In bipolar disorder (BD), illness progression has been associated with a higher number of mood episodes and hospitalizations, reduced interepisode intervals, poorer response to treatment, and cognitive/functional impairment. The term ‘neuroprogression” has been proposed to describe the pathological rewiring of the brain that takes place when clinical and cognitive deterioration occurs in the context of the progression of BD. Accordingly, neuroprogression would correspond to the biological underpinnings of illness progression and staging in BD. In some cases of BD it is possible to identify an active process of neuroprogression mediated by immune activation which cincludes: a) inflammation, b) changes in growth factors, c) oxidative stress and d) mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent evidence showing neuroinflammation in BD suggest that it may be associated with neuroprogressive changes such as incremental volume loss in brain, cognitive changes, and a declining likelihood of response to pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. Prompt treatment may be potentially neuroprotective and attenuate the volumetric and neurocognitive changes that emerge with chronicity. Accumulating evidence suggest that the assessment of immune activation in BD may be a means to assess illness progression. Interventions aiming at reducing immune activation in BD are currently being tested.",

      "title": "Is Favorable Outcome Possible After Prolonged Refractory Status Epilepticus?",
      "abstract": "Summary: When status epilepticus (SE) remains refractory to appropriate therapy, it is associated with high mortality and with substantial morbidity in survivors. Many outcome predictors such as age, seizure type, level of consciousness before treatment, and mostly, etiology, are well-established. A longer duration of SE is often associated with worse outcome, but duration may lose its prognostic value after several hours. Several terms and definitions have been used to describe prolonged, refractory SE, including “malignant SE,” “prolonged” SE, and more recently, “super refractory” SE, defined as “SE that has continued or recurred despite 24 hours of general anesthesia (or coma-inducing anticonvulsants).” There are few data available regarding the outcome of prolonged refractory SE, and even fewer for SE remaining refractory to anesthetic drugs. This article reviews reports of outcome after prolonged, refractory, and “super refractory” SE. Most information detailing the clinical outcome of patients surviving these severe illnesses, in which seizures can persist for days or weeks (and especially those concerning “super-refractory” SE) come from case reports and retrospective cohort studies. In many series, prolonged, refractory SE has a mortality of 30% to 50%, and several studies indicate that most survivors have a substantial decline in functional status. Nevertheless, several reports demonstrate that good functional outcome is possible even after several days of SE and coma induction. Treatment of refractory SE should not be withdrawn from younger patients without structural brain damage at presentation solely because of the duration of SE.",

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "title": "Neurodynamic state fluctuations in the epileptic brain",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Neurodynamic state fluctuations in the epileptic brain Catherine Stamoulis1* and Bernard S. Chang2 1 Children's Hospital Boston, United States 2 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, United States RATIONALE: Dynamically, the brain is never at rest. In the absence of task-induced neuromodulations and behavior- and/or stimulus-related state transitions, neural dynamics may fluctuate transiently and spontaneously between resting states, associated with arousal, self-reflection, emotion, or memory retrieval, among other processes. These may be represent short-term, but stable states, and may involve specific networks, as as the Default Mode Network (DMN), and distinct frequency ranges. Brain dynamics are also modulated by physiological states at longer temporal scales, such as sleep. Furthermore, abnormal neuronal networks dynamics may also be associated with distinct, pathological states and related transitions. For example, neurodynamic fluctuations and local and/or global network transitions to unstable states may be mechanisms of seizure initiation in patients with epilepsy. To date, these mechanisms remain only partially understood, which has limited the development of efficient treatments for medically intractable seizures. METHODS: We investigated the spatio-temporal variation and stability of dynamic states encoded in non-invasive, continuous (recorded over multiple days) electroencephalograms (EEGs), from 5 patients with multiple focal seizures of temporal origin. EEGs were analyzed in the range 1-250 Hz. We hypothesized that latent dynamic state fluctuations are encoded in these recordings, but are not directly measurable. We, therefore, developed a dynamic non-linear state-space dynamic model and estimated state fluctuations from i) scalp EEGs covering the entire brain, and ii) subsets of signals that are part of the DMN. In this preliminary study, we investigated and characterized the stability of estimated states through a simple analysis of the time-dependent eigenvalues of the state-space matrix. RESULTS: Dynamic state fluctuations were identified at distinct spatio-temporal scales and frequency ranges. In particular, spatially global transitions to distinct, yet stable states, not associated with measurable changes in any particular physiological state, e.g., sleep, were estimated at least 45 min prior to clinical seizure onset in all patients (and on average 70 min prior to ictal onset in two patients), at frequencies <=12 Hz. Furthermore, transitions of shorter duration, from a stable to an unstable state were estimated at higher frequencies (typically 30-50 Hz) on average 5-12 min prior to seizure onset, and at different rates. Rapid transient fluctuations to unstable states were specifically estimated from EEGs covering temporal regions and slower transitions were estimated in frontal channels and occipital channels. Dynamic instability extended into the ictal interval. On average 20-40 s into that interval, transitions to one or multiple states (depending on the patient) were estimated, which, in turn, extended into the post-ictal interval. Finally, the brain returned to a dynamic state of the same type of stability as estimated at baseline on average 70-90 min following seizure termination. No specific differences in state variation and stability were observed in elements of the DMN. CONCLUSION: There preliminary results suggest dynamic state fluctuations and possibly pathological transitions to both stable and unstable states at different frequencies, and different rates, may represent at least one mechanism of neural instability that may trigger seizure initiation in the epileptic brain. Based on the type of their (in)stability, these fluctuations appear to be distinct from normal resting state variations encoded in normal baseline EEGs.

EOD has a severe impact on the everyday life of both the patient involved and his caregivers. This situation is challenging for the clinician, taking into consideration the fact that differential diagnosis is broader as compared to late onset dementia. Infrequent degenerative causes or rare diseases including inherited metabolic disorders need to be excluded. Moreover, even common degenerative dementias like Alzheimer disease have an unusual clinical pattern in younger patients and are therefore more difficult to diagnose. A thorough evaluation of symptoms, family history and neuropsychological deficits along with a targeted laboratory testing would unveil the underlying disorder in most cases. This is of great clinical significance since a great proportion of EOD causes are putatively treatable when diagnosed during an early stage of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by two or more years of recurrent and intermittent mood episodes in which the individual oscillates or “cycles” between periods of depression and hypomania, with or without normal periods interspersed between the depressive and hypomanic states. Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "title": "Current Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment of Functional Neurological Disorders",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited. Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.",

In general, causes of delayed awakening can be separated into drug effects, pathophysiologic effects and surgical causes. The persistence of an anesthetic drug effect can occur with patients who are pharmacologically prone to a greater than expected drug response or prolonged drug action, or in cases of drug overdose. Retention of carbon dioxide despite adequate oxygen saturation can lead to CO2 narcosis and delay recovery. Although the CO2 levels necessary cause narcosis are high, this scenario is possible with a COPD patient, who is hypoventilating during the administration of supplemental O2. Hyperglycemia can cause persistence of unconsciousness due to the formation of a hyperosmolar state with diuresis.

According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3), narcolepsy is typically associated with cataplexy and/or other REM sleep phenomena such as hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Narcolepsy is not an uncommon disorder, but is under-recognized. The age of onset shows two peaks of presentation: in childhood and in adults. Both genetics and environmental factors may be involved in the development of narcolepsy. The history, combined with polysomnography and MSLT, remain the current gold standard in the diagnosis of narcolepsy. The levels of Hypocretin-1 are undetectable in the cerebrospinal fluid in most patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy. Early recognition and treatment can greatly improve the quality of life of patients with narcolepsy. Treatment of narcolepsy includes non-pharmacological treatment (life style changes) and pharmacological (stimulants, modafinil, sodium oxybate) against hypersomnia and anticataplectic drugs (antidepressants and sodium oxybate).",

      "abstract": "Epileptic encephalopathy encompasses conditions in which cognitive, motor, or sensory deficits result as a consequence of epileptic activity defining certain syndromes. It therefore represents a more severe subset of epilepsy, which can be generally characterized as frequent or severe seizures leading to cerebral dysfunction. This disturbance in cerebral functioning can in turn hinder, somewhat dramatically, cognitive development and further impact the future lives of patients. In this paper, we describe the cognitive consequences of status epilepticus in children and in adults in the context of plasticity theories. Recent studies maintain that consequences of SE may be severe cognitive sequelae, especially in early life. Since the residual consequences of SE in adulthood seem less detrimental and long-lasting, we argue that early life insults, such as those created by SE, during a rapid period of development and functional specialization, result in specific cognitive deficits dependent on the sensitive period at which SE occurred.",

      "abstract": "Drugs that affect neurotransmitter release can induce changes in neuroregulation during chronic administration. Thus, in addition to recurrence of symptoms of the illness, discontinuation of treatment can be associated with clinical signs and symptoms related to these changes. Atomoxetine, a new drug approved in the United States for treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is associated with blockade of the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter. Because treatment of ADHD typically involves chronic treatment, the potential for production of a discontinuation syndrome as well as recurrence of symptoms upon drug discontinuation were assessed as part of the clinical development process. The effects of discontinuation of atomoxetine were assessed in children and adults with ADHD following 9 to 10 weeks of continuous therapy in 4 large studies. Symptoms of ADHD worsened following drug discontinuation but did not return to pretreatment levels. The incidence of discontinuation-emergent adverse events was low and there were no statistically significant differences between the patients abruptly discontinuing from atomoxetine and those continuing on placebo. Discontinuation of atomoxetine did not result in the development of an acute discontinuation syndrome and was well tolerated. It appears that atomoxetine may be discontinued without risk for symptom rebound or discontinuation-emergent adverse effects. Tapering of doses is not necessary when atomoxetine is discontinued.",

The extended definition includes interventions that slows or halt the progression of neuronal degeneration. This book will describe the natural mechanisms of neuroprotection, agents used as neuroprotectives and therapeutic neuroprotection in all neurological disorders where there is danger of progression of neurological damage regardless of the pathological process or clinical features. Prophylactic neuroprotection during anesthesia and surgery is also discussed. Neuroprotection may also be used for prevention of progression of a disease if it can be identified at a presymptomatic stage. The term neuroprotective, although an adjective, will be used as a noun in preference to neuroprotectant.",

      "title": "Hipoglikemijski sindromi - dijagnostički i terapijski pristup i prikaz dva slučaja",
      "abstract": "Prevention of hypoglycemia is essential for preservation of brain metabolism and survival of the whole body. Normally, glucose is only substrate used by the brain to meet its metabolic requirements. When plasma glucose concentration decreases (e.g., during prolonged fasting or after administration of glucose-lowering drugs) several physiological responses are activated to prevent further decreases in blood glucose. The first response is known as counterregulation, a system that prevents and corrects hypoglycemia through the release of counterregulatory hormones. Ultimately traceable to neural glucose deprivation, symptoms of hypoglycemia include neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Neurogenic symptoms (tremulousness, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias) are results of the perception of physiologic changes caused by the autonomic nervous system’s response to hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, sensation of warmth, weakness or fatigue, severe cognitive failure, seizure, coma) are the results of brain glucose deprivation itself. Glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations following recent episodes of hypoglycemia, leading to the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness-loss of warming symptoms of developing hypoglycemia. Thus, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia (e.g. those with tightly controlled diabetes or with an insulinoma) often tolerate abnormal low plasma glucose concentration without symptoms. Classification of symptoms of hypoglycemia, namely reactive versus fasting based on segregation by timing in relation to meals is no longer useful from a clinical point of view. Every patient with neuroglycopenic symptoms regardless of relation to food ingestion, requires comprehensive evaluation. Identification of the possible cause of hypoglycemia and selection of diagnostic modalities are facilitated by considering whether the patients appears to be healthy (with or without compensated coexistent disease) or ill (with a disease known to have a proclivity to develop hypoglycemia, or is hospitalized). Medications may mediate hypoglycemia in anybody, whether they appear healthy or ill. Optimal condition for confirming the presence and accurately diagnosing the type of hypoglycemic disorder occurs at the time of spontaneous spell. Otherwise, dynamic testing to generate conductive conditions should be conducted in any patients with a history of neuroglycopenic symptoms, regardless of relation to meal ingestion. Specific criteria regarding beta-cell polypeptide concentrations are required to establish hyperinsulinemia. Sulfonylureas in plasma should be measured with sensitive assays. Surgical management of insulinoma begins with simply considering the diagnosis then proceeding to establish absolutely the biochemical diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

      "title": "The cognitive footprint of medication: A review of cognitive assessments in clinical trials",
      "abstract": "What is known and objective Polypharmacy is common, and many medications have cognitive side effects. Such effects can be transient and subside when the drug in question is discontinued or can be long-lasting with effects present for years afterwards. Although formal assessment of cognition is feasible and often undertaken in neuropsychiatric trials, these effects are usually neglected in the evaluation of any non-neuropsychiatric health intervention. Medication effects can be assessed within a cognitive footprint framework, to account for the magnitude and the duration of cognitive side effects, with some likely to have a greater and more lasting effect than others. Comment Adverse event reporting suggests that many medications may be indirectly associated with cognitive effects, for example due to headaches, somnolence and ‘dizziness’; however, inferring causation from adverse event reporting can be problematic. In order to better understand the impact of investigational drug and concomitant medications effect on cognition, it would be essential to ensure cognition is prioritized in drug development evaluation. It is suggested that simple instruments that can be easily incorporated into existing trial designs are used to assess the cognitive footprint of medication. What is new and conclusion We present an overview of existing measures of cognition that can be integrated into drug trials in order to provide a cognitive footprint. Like quality of life testing, such tests should be administered as a standard throughout the key assessment stages of the design of the trial to ensure that any effects on this equally important outcome are also documented. Furthermore, employing routine cognition testing may also enable researchers to identify unanticipated beneficial and non-beneficial effects on cognition. Provision of such a cognitive footprint profile of drugs may provide the necessary evidence to enable decision-makers to make informed decisions on risk-benefit analysis that can subsequently make trade-offs between different drug regimens.",

Current NMBAs are classified as aminosteroids or benzylisoquinoliniums and have different features, but none are ideal. Selection of the best NMBA is determined by individual patient characteristics. Proper use of these agents includes a comprehensive plan to manage all aspects of care affected by NMBA, as well as monitoring of clinical effect and degree of neuromuscular blockade via periodic peripheral nerve stimulation. There are well-recognized complications of NMBA, including prolonged drug effect and acute quadriplegic myopathy. The latter condition can result in prolonged rehabilitation. The use of an NMBA can be essential for the successful outcome from critical illness; however, cautious use of these agents with a structured approach to minimize complications is urged.",

      "title": "Acute peri‐operative neurocognitive disorders: a narrative review",
      "abstract": "Summary Peri‐operative neurocognitive disorders are the most common complication experienced by older individuals undergoing anaesthesia and surgery. Peri‐operative neurocognitive disorders, particularly postoperative delirium, result in long‐term poor outcomes including: death; dementia; loss of independence; and poor cognitive and functional outcomes. Recent changes to the nomenclature of these disorders aims to align peri‐operative neurocognitive disorders with cognitive disorders in the community, with consistent definitions and clinical diagnosis. Possible mechanisms include: undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease; inflammation and resulting neuroinflammation; neuronal damage; and comorbid systemic disease. Pre‐operative frailty represents a significant risk for poor postoperative outcomes; it is associated with an increase in the incidence of cognitive decline at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. In addition to cognitive decline, frailty is associated with poor functional outcomes following elective non‐cardiac surgery. It was recently shown that 29% of frail patients died or experienced institutionalisation or new disability within 90 days of major elective surgery. Identification of vulnerable patients before undergoing surgery and anaesthesia is the key to preventing peri‐operative neurocognitive disorders. Current approaches include: pre‐operative delirium and cognitive screening; blood biomarker analysis; intra‐operative management that may reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium such as lighter anaesthesia using processed electroencephalography devices; and introduction of guidelines which may reduce or prevent delirium and postoperative neurocognitive disorders. This review will address these issues and advocate for an approach to care for older peri‐operative patients which starts in the community and continues throughout the pre‐operative, intra‐operative, postoperative and post‐discharge phases of care management, involving multidisciplinary medical teams, as well as family and caregivers wherever possible.",

      "abstract": "This commentary is to inform clinicians challenged with an increase in people seeking treatment for Substance Use Disorder (SUD), that the ninety percent revolving door, is, in part, due to post–withdrawal, untreated neurotoxicity. This impairment attenuates neurotransmitter signaling and compromises resting state functional connectivity, leading to unwanted sequelae including depression, sleep disturbances, sensation seeking, lack of satisfaction and impulsivity. Neuroimaging studies indicate that neurobiological recovery can take years. Like a \"double edge sword\" SUD has a biological bi –directional (bio-directional) effect on the brain reward circuitry. The acute intake of psychoactive drugs results in heightened dopaminergic activity, while, the opposite, hypodopaminergia occurs following chronic abuse. Individuals with SUD can have a genetic predisposition, compounded by stress and neurotoxically induced, epigenetic insults that impact recovery from protracted abstinence. Follow-up post –short-term recovery usually includes supportive therapies and programs like 12 –steps and other fellowships. However, relapse will usually occur if post –short-term recovery hypodopaminergia is not treated with attempts at epigenetic manipulation of compromised brain neurochemistry using some manner of pro-dopamine regulation.",

      "title": "Treating Catatonia: a Blind Spot of Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Whether or not nonconvulsive status epilepticus produces permanent brain damage is a source of controversy. Contributing to the controversy is the lack of clarity for classifying the clinical and electrographic phenomena that constitute nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus commonly occurs in the context of an acute brain injury. For example, it commonly persists in generalized convulsive status epilepticus after convulsive activity has stopped, and it is not uncommonly associated with acute cerebral ischemia. Its clinical characteristics are ambiguous, subtle, and nonspecific making the diagnosis difficult. In the absence of EEG testing, it is likely to be missed or delayed. When acute brain injury and nonconvulsive status epilepticus occur concurrently, the severity of acute brain injury has traditionally been accepted as determining patient outcome. However, increasing evidence suggests that the two conditions are synergistically detrimental and increase brain injury. Guidelines remain to be established for the intensity and duration of anticonvulsant therapy in these patients. Evidence suggests that, in the absence of extreme and irreversible acute brain injury, early intensive intervention is necessary to improve the otherwise poor outcome of these patients.",

Understanding the neurobiological aspects of cognitive deficits is important, because cognition evolves as a therapeutic target in treating depression. Cognitive symptoms can precede or linger after symptoms of depression, such as sleep, appetite, and affective symptoms, improve. Emerging literature on medications targeting cognition in patients with depression should be considered when clinical decisions are made. Residual cognitive symptoms have been identified as a predictor of poor outcomes when treating depression.

Although the prognosis is thought to be benign, limited long-term follow-up studies exist. This was the objective of our study in addition to exploring the risks of future developmental, behavioral, or neurological abnormalities.Series of consecutive infants with gratification phenomena were identified both retrospectively and prospectively over an eight year period from a single pediatric neurology service. The diagnosis was based on descriptive history, review of videotaped events, lack of neurological or developmental abnormalities, and normal routine electroencephalogram.Nineteen infants were followed for 3-11 years (mean 7.1). Their ages ranged between 4-13 months (mean 7) with 79% females. The diagnosis was not reached by the referring physician and 74% were misdiagnosed as epilepsy or movement disorder. The episodes recurred with variable frequency with gradual reduction in number and increase in length of attack-free periods with advancing age. Complete remission was noted in all patients by age 1-3 years (mean 1.9). However, 4 children (21%) developed features of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) on long-term follow up. In this group, the gratification phenomena appeared at a younger age with higher attack frequency.Gratification phenomena in infants are benign and self-limited, often spontaneously disappearing by two years of age. A correlation with future ADHD was found; however, larger prospective studies are needed to further examine this possible association.",

One of the mostly recognized examples is coeliac disease where patients endure the large spectrum of psychopathological symptoms, starting with attention deficit all the way down to the intellectual disability in extreme cases. It has not been fully explained how the pathomechanism of digestive system diseases affects patient's mental health, however one of the hypothesis suggests that it is due to serotonergic or opioid neurotransmission imbalance caused by gluten and gluten metabolites effect on central nervous system. Behavioral changes can also be invoked by liver or pancreatic diseases, which causes life-threatening abnormalities within a brain. It occurs that these abnormalities reflexively exacerbate the symptoms of primary somatic disease and aggravate its course, which worsens prognosis. The dominant mental disease mentioned in this article is depression which because of its effect on a hypothalamuspituitary- adrenal axis and on an autonomic nervous system, not only aggravates the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases but may accelerate their onset in genetically predisposed patients. Depression is known to negatively affects patients' ability to function in a society and a quality of their lives. Moreover, as far as children are concerned, the occurrence of digestive system diseases accompanied by mental disorders, may adversely affect their further physical and psychological development, which merely results in worse school performance. All those aspects of mental disorders indicate the desirability of the psychological care for patients with recognized digestive system disease. The psychological assistance should be provided immediately after diagnosis of a primary disease and be continued throughout the whole course of treatment.",

      "title": "Episodic Memories and Their Relevance for Psychoactive Drug Use and Addiction",
      "abstract": "The majority of adult people in western societies regularly consume psychoactive drugs. While this consumption is integrated in everyday life activities and controlled in most consumers, it may escalate and result in drug addiction. Non-addicted drug use requires the systematic establishment of highly organized behaviours, such as drug seeking and -taking. While a significant role for classical and instrumental learning processes is well established in drug use and abuse, declarative drug memories have largely been neglected in research. Episodic memories are an important part of the declarative memories. Here a role of episodic drug memories in the establishment of non-addicted drug use and its transition to addiction is suggested. In relation to psychoactive drug consumption, episodic drug memories are formed when a person prepares for consumption, when the drug is consumed and, most important, when acute effects, withdrawal, craving, and relapse are experienced. Episodic drug memories are one-trial memories with emotional components that can be much stronger than 'normal' episodic memories. Their establishment coincides with drug-induced neuronal activation and plasticity. These memories may be highly extinction resistant and influence psychoactive drug consumption, in particular during initial establishment and at the transition to 'drug instrumentalization'. In that, understanding how addictive drugs interact with episodic memory circuits in the brain may provide crucial information for how drug use and addiction are established.",

Potential critical illness/intensive care-related risk factors include severity of organ failure, high-dose benzodiazepine administration, longer ICU stays, stressful ICU experiences, and early post-intensive care distress.

There is increasing recognition that ADHD symptoms and clinically defined disorder can persist into adult life and are associated with later drug and alcohol misuse and social and work difficulties. Added to that is the extreme variability of the disorder over time, within the same individual, between individuals, and across different circumstances. Treatment with stimulants and nonstimulants has proven effective in different subgroups, with the effectiveness of specific agents most likely related to the primary neurotransmitter involved. However, stimulants with a short duration of action have been problematic for some patients.

Recent advances in neuroimaging and electrophysiologic tools may aid the diagnosis and prognostication. Treatment for recovery of consciousness is still limited.

As condições mais associadas a esses prejuízos são depressão, delirium, comprometimento cognitivo leve e demência. Os mecanismos envolvidos ainda não estão estabelecidos, mas alguns fatores, como dano neuronal induzido pelas toxinas urêmicas, lesões cerebrovasculares isquêmicas, estresse oxidativo, inflamação crônica, anemia, hiper-homocisteinemia e disfunção endotelial, podem ser importantes. O desempenho neuropsicológico tende a melhorar com o início da diálise, apesar de algumas disfunções cognitivas permanecerem alteradas mesmo após a instituição do tratamento, principalmente nos domínios de atenção, flexibilidade cognitiva, memória e aprendizagem. O transplante renal pode melhorar e, inclusive, reverter alguns déficits cognitivos, apesar de prejuízos na memória verbal e nas funções executivas poderem permanecer. O diagnóstico do declínio cognitivo nos pacientes renais crônicos pode ter impacto no manejo e no prognóstico. Este artigo apresenta uma atualização sobre declínio das funções cognitivas nos pacientes com DRC.",

      "title": "Preventing and treating delirium in clinical settings for older adults",
      "abstract": "Delirium is a serious consequence of many acute or worsening chronic medical conditions, a side effect of medications, and a precipitant of worsening functional and cognitive status in older adults. It is a syndrome characterized by fluctuations in cognition and impaired attention that develops over a short period of time in response to an underlying medical condition, a substance (prescribed, over the counter, or recreational), or substance withdrawal and can be multi-factorial. We present a narrative review of the literature on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to prevention and treatment of delirium with a focus on older adults as a vulnerable population. Older adult patients are most at risk due to decreasing physiologic reserves, with delirium rates of up to 80% in critical care settings. Presentation of delirium can be hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed, making identification and study challenging as patients with hypoactive delirium are less likely to come to attention in an inpatient or long-term care setting. Studies of delirium focus on prevention and treatment with nonpharmacological or medication interventions, with the preponderance of evidence favoring multi-component nonpharmacological approaches to prevention as the most effective. Though use of antipsychotic medication in delirium is common, existing evidence does not support routine use, showing no clear benefit in clinically significant outcome measures and with evidence of harm in some studies. We therefore suggest that antipsychotics be used to treat agitation, psychosis, and distress associated with delirium at the lowest effective doses and shortest possible duration and not be considered a treatment of delirium itself. Future studies may clarify the use of other agents, such as melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, alpha-2 receptor agonists, and anti-epileptics.",

The amorphous nature of this experience has made identifying its etiology challenging, but recent advances in neurology and understanding of implicit memory and attention are helping to clarify this cognitive illusion. More specifically, déjà vu may result from (a) a brief change in normal neural transmission speed causing a slightly longer separation between identical messages received from two separate pathways, (b) a brief split in a continuous perceptual experience that is caused by distractions (external or internal) and gives the impression of two separate perceptual events, and (c) the activation of implicit familiarity for some portion (or all) of the present experience without an accompanying conscious recollection of the prior encounter.

These changes become manifest in the moderately severe stage of AD, when patients begin to require ongoing assistance with activities of daily life (ADL), and they are prominent in the severe stage of AD, when patients are continuously dependent on a caregiver. Patients in these stages often display behavioral disturbances during care activities. These disturbing behaviors result not only from cognitive impairment, but also from a patient's physical inability to cooperate with the caregiver. When care management strategies take into account the characteristic physical restrictions resulting from the neuromotor changes that accompany advanced AD, the caregiving process may be significantly facilitated.",

      "title": "Delayed Neuronal Degeneration Results from Endogenous Glutamate Excess",
      "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes clinical neurological dysfunction that may be acute, fluctuating, or progressive.1,2 The molecular basis for neuronal injury has not been elucidated, although antineuronal antibodies have been identified in some patients. Immune-mediated injury to vessels or to coagulation cascades that cause inflammatory vasculopathies or embolic or hemorrhagic phenomena can produce ischemia and neuron death, as in stroke, seizures, and spinal cord and peripheral nervous system disease.3 Questions about the mechanism of chronic neurological disease in SLE, such as encephalopathy, and cognitive and behavioral disorders, arise when the autoantibody markers for active SLE fail to correlate with the neurological symptoms.1,4,5 (For an alternate opinion, see ref. 6.) Some will argue that this failure amounts to inadequate methodology either in detection of autoantibodies or in detection of a cytokine imbalance that mediates central nervous system injury independent of autoantibodies. Alternatively, chronic or progressive neurological symptoms in SLE may not depend on the activity of the systemic disease. For example, neurologic disease in SLE could depend on nonimmune-mediated factors like infection and toxic effects of medications. There is another possible mechanism that would account for the failure of chronic or progressive neurological disease to correlate with systemic disease. Recent experiments in several different animal models suggest that an initial insult to the brain may initiate a cascade of events that ultimately lead to distal progressive neuron loss. Based on these studies it is possible that an immune insult could initiate injury and become resolved, but the neuron injury could continue in an expanding cascade without the presence of serum markers of immunologic disease. Building on experimental evidence that had demonstrated that the increased excitatory effect of glutamate and calcium influx causes neuronal death, studies on different animal models suggest that after an initial injury, neurons distant from the region of the first injury may die as the excitatory and inhibitory tone changes on downstream glutamate neurons.7–15 One experimental model demonstrated that ischemic or neurotoxic damage to the striatum caused, days later, the degeneration of 50% of the GABA neurons in the substantia nigra,13–15 although the substantia nigra was not damaged by the initial striatal injury. Behavioral changes in the animals correlated with the development of delayed neuronal degeneration.16 One possible mechanism for the delayed degeneration of GABA neurons in the substantia nigra reticulata depended on glutamatergic overactivity. A brief review of the critical feature of the anatomy of the striatonigral system shows that the substantia nigra reticulata receives inhibitory afferents from the striatum (caudate-putamen and globus pallidus), and excitatory glutamatergic afferents from the subthalamic nucleus. In the next experiment, ablation of the subthalamic nucleus occurred prior to the striatal injury. The nigral GABA neurons were completely protected from the endogenous excitotoxicity.14 These results suggest a central role for alterations of glutamate activity in chronic progressive neurological disease and raise the question of whether SLE cytokines or antibodies may provoke similar delayed neuronal injury by altering glutamatergic activity. In this hypothesis SLE cytokines or antibodies might affect upstream neurons and initiate a cascade of events that would evolve over a longer time, and lead eventually to neuronal death through overexcitation; alternatively SLE cytokines or antibodies might acutely affect glutamate receptors. This hypothesis would be plausible if SLE determined brain injury-affected neurons with excitatory or inhibitory activity on glutamatergic neurons or if SLE cytokines or antibodies demonstrated an effect on glutamate receptors. In fact, it has been demonstrated in SLE that microinfarcts and larger vessel occlusions destroy cortical, striatal, or thalamic brain regions with afferents to downstream glutamatergic neurons. Also, in SLE, defective regulation and function of interleukin-4, -6, and -10 have been recorded,17,18 and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that interleukin-6 protects neurons against glutamate-induced death.19 Interleukin-1-receptor antagonist also protects against excitotoxin-induced neuron death in in vivo experiments.20 Furthermore, some studies have identified a lymphocytotoxic antibody that cross-reacts with brain tissue.21 The recent finding, however, of autoantibodies to the glutamate receptor in patients with encephalitis and paraneoplastic syndrome22,23 may set the stage for a discovery of an autoantibody in SLE to the glutamate receptor. These data suggest that the search for the pathogenesis of the chronic neurological symptoms in SLE should also include the possibility that delayed neuronal degeneration may occur after the initial injury and need not necessarily associate with active SLE. Delayed neuronal degeneration might help explain the progressive or fluctuating neurologic impairments in systemic lupus erythematosus.",

      "abstract": "Patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) usually develop significant behavioral disturbances with progression of the disease. We tested our clinical observation that development of disruptive agitation is more likely in semantic than in nonfluent PPA and examined which clinical variables could be associated with this behavior.We retrospectively analyzed neuropsychiatric scores and the need for behavioral treatments in semantic PPA (n = 41) and nonfluent PPA (n = 39) cases and compared first (1-3 years since the onset of symptoms) and last (5-13 years since the onset) evaluations. Clinical variables and laterality of temporal atrophy were associated with symptoms in semantic PPA cases.The semantic PPA group developed more frequent (p = 0.03) and intense agitation (p = 0.0008) and had a greater need for antipsychotic drugs (p = 0.001) than the nonfluent PPA group. Presence of agitation was clearly associated with psychotic symptoms (delusions/hallucinations) but was not associated with gender, age at onset, duration of the disease, or laterality of temporal atrophy. In contrast, nonfluent PPA cases were more frequently depressed and treated with antidepressants (p = 0.0007). There were no differences in anxiety, irritability, apathy, perseverations, hyperorality, or abnormal motor behavior.Semantic PPA in advanced disease is frequently associated with agitation and psychotic symptoms with fewer mood symptoms, while nonfluent PPA maintains a high prevalence of depression. This implies different treatment and care and support needs for each group.",

Drug side effects can be severe, contribute to poor compliance and are therefore a factor in maintaining illness and precipitating relapse. Treatment resistance is common. Current evidence suggests that a number of pharmacological agents which are available in other countries (and in some cases have been for many years) may be useful when side effects or treatment resistance occur. In some cases these alternatives are part of recommended algorithms for treatment. In New Zealand, when side effects occur, the options are limited and the problem of treatment resistance is usually approached by using poorly researched combinations of the currently available drugs, thus increasing the likelihood of side effects and adverse drug interactions. The current system is failing to provide appropriate or adequate treatment for people suffering from affective disorders and should be urgently reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Various studies have suggested that Alzeimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic process that begins well before clinical expression of dementia. Moreover, works showed that weak cognitive performances can precede by a few years the diagnosis of AD. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) describes a state of abnormal cognitive functioning that is insufficient to warrant a diagnosis of dementia. The concept of MCI nominates old persons afflicted with light cognitive disorders which could present certain signs of AD several years before this one is not diagnosed. MCI does not significantly impact basic daily activities and is not accompanied by declines in overall cognitive function. People with MCI are three to four times more likely to develop Alzheimer's than those without such impairment. Amnestic MCI (significantly affects memory) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease, while nonamnestic MCI may progress to other types of syndromes (such as frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia or dementia with Lewy bodies). But some people with MCI don't go on to develop any type of dementia. Some remain stable, while others even revert to normal.The conversion rate from MCI to AD is 12% per year. After a brief presentation of the concept of MCI, this communication will emphasize on different subjects like cognitive area. This deficits will be link with neuroimmaging that demonstrate atrophic hippocampal formations, atrophic enthorinal cortices, greater total brain atrophy, enlarge ventricles. We demonstrated deficits in : – memory: episodic memory, visuopsatial and spatial short terme memory -executive function: flexibility and planification -attention : focus attention, visual search, ability to desengaged attention and to use visual cue to produce an alerting effect. MCI is a concept based on criteria of Petersen. This criteria help us to know if MCI is a transition state between cognitive decline on normal aging and clinical presentation of dementia. More over, this cognitive deficits help us to make the link between cognitive area and activity of daily living. MCI is a new hope for our generation and the prevention of dementia.",

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

      "title": "Cocaine Addiction as a Neurological Disorder: Implications for Treatment",
      "abstract": "Clinical and preclinical studies provide convincing evidence for persistent neurological/psychiatric impairments and possible neuronal degeneration associated with chronic cocaine/stimulant abuse. These impairments include multifocal and global cerebral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhages, infarctions, optic neuropathy, cerebral atrophy, cognitive impairments, and mood and movement disorders. These findings may encourage the placement of stimulant addiction into the category of organic brain disorders. Functional and microanatomical anomalies in the frontal and temporal cortex as well as other brain regions may be responsible for certain aspects of phenomenology and neuropsychopathology that are characteristic of stimulant polydrug addictions. These may include broad spectrum of deficits in cognition, motivation, and insight; behavioral disinhibition; attention deficits; emotional instability; impulsiveness; aggressiveness; depression; anhedonia; and persistent movement disorders. Although it is still debated whether the hypofrontality and other brain anomalies observed in stimulant abusers are a consequence or an antecedent of drug abuse, this debate seems purely academic and irrelevant with respect to the importance of compensating for these deficits in the development of treatment strategies. The neuropsychiatric impairments accompanying stimulant abuse may contribute to the very high rate of relapse in addicts that can take place after long periods (years) of abstinence. It is possible that the neurological deficits present in stimulant addicts, whether they are primary or secondary to stimulant abuse, are responsible for perpetual drug abuse which may be a form of self-medication (Weiss et al. 1991, 1992). In this context, addiction to stimulants, once fully developed, may represent a true biological dependency on drugs that temporarily compensate for existing neurological deficits. The concept of self-medication by drug addicts is supported by major theories of biological psychiatry. While a majority of drug addicts are polydrug users, there seems to be a preference for a particular type of drug among different populations of addicts. Addicts who experience distress, anxious dysphoria, and turbulent anger prefer the calming actions of opiates, whereas addicts with preceding attention deficit disorder, depression, or bipolar disorder often prefer stimulants (Khantzian 1985). Figure 1 presents conceptual relationships between brain damage and cocaine/stimulant abuse. More clinical studies are needed to establish unequivocally the epidemiological relationships between preexisting neurological deficits-resulting either from genetic, developmental, traumatic, or neurotoxic factors- and vulnerability to drug addictions. Nonetheless, deducing from the results of preclinical studies, it is conceivable that individuals with neurological deficits associated with attention deficit disorder, developmental neuroanatomical abnormalities, lead poisoning, alcoholism, posttraumatic brain lesions, and PTSD may be more vulnerable to stimulant addiction. This notion has significant empirical support as preclinical studies have shown that animals with lesioned prefrontal cortex became supersensitive to cocaine (Schenk et al. 1991) and animals with lesions at the amygdala, VTA, or raphe nuclei manifest more rapid acquisition of amphetamine self-administration than control rats (Deminiere et al. 1989). The above arguments, postulating neuropathology as an intrinsic component of stimulant addiction, should be taken into consideration with the caveat that the clinical manifestations of the disease are heterogenous and addicts may express varying stages and degrees of the disease as determined by environmental and genetic factors. Therefore, it is likely that stimulant addicts who have less advanced neuropathology may recover spontaneously after detoxification with proper nutritional and psychotherapeutic support if they can sustain abstinence.

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

The early detection and treatment of depression simultaneously with the neurological disorder is key to avoiding deterioration and further disability. Although the neurologist should be able to identify and treat depression initially, a neuropsychiatry team should be available for severe cases and those who are unresponsive to treatment. Neurologists should be also aware that in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, different depression symptoms could develop at different stages of the disease. The treatment options for depression in neurological diseases include drugs, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and somatic interventions, among others, but often, the evidence-based efficacy is limited and the results are highly variable.

      "title": "Die Beeinflussung des Langzeitverlaufs schizophrener Krankheiten durch somatotherapeutische Massnahmen",
      "abstract": "Controlled studies have revealed that neuroleptic treatment alone has a significant effect in schizophrenic patients and that with parenteral treatment with depot neuroleptics the relapse rate after 1 and 2 years is significantly lower than with oral neuroleptic medication. About 20% of schizophrenic patients do not have relapses even without treatment. The effectiveness of neuroleptic long-term medication with regard to the prevention of relapses was proved by discontinuation trials for a period of up to 3 years. Up to now, however, there is no proof that drug therapy influences the long-term prognosis beyond the 3 years. The results of the Bonn schizophrenia study show the extraordinary variability of the courses and outcomes. Although some anamnestic and clinical prognostically favourable or unfavourable factors could be found, a reliable individual prognosis at the onset of the disease is not possible. Initially phasic courses with complete remission of the early psychotic features can later nevertheless lead to residual syndromes; on the other hand, chronic persistent psychoses can show a permanent remission leaving only slightly, non-specific residual states even as late at the 2nd to the 4th decade of the disease independent of the therapy. Some findings of the Bonn study, indicating a favourable influence of psychical treatments on the long-term course are described. They include the so-called catastrophic schizophrenia which at a rate of 4% occurs less frequently than in the past, the significantly poorer long-term prognosis of those patients who had not been treated in the beginning of the disease (taking into account subgroups with peracute, acute and subacute onsets on the initial psychotic manifestations), the significantly less favourable long-term prognosis of patients whose disease began prior to the era of psychopharmacological drugs, and the significantly more frequent occurrence of complete remissions of patients of the subgroups with peracute and acute onsets of the psychosis who had started treatment within 1 year after the onset of the disease (including the prodromal stage). Early diagnosis and treatment of the prodromal symptoms can probably improve the chance of a complete remission. The finding of a higher rate of patients with mixed residual states at the expense of the typical schizophrenic defect psychoses within the partial subgroup of the specific residual states with long-term neurolepsy could suggest that long-term medication is responsible for the ‘partially pharmacogenic change in symptomatology’ of schizophrenia in as far as it causes or favours a shift from the typical syndromes to the mixed residual states mainly brought about by a potential reduction in symptoms.",

To date, however, there is little literature on pseudodementia as a delayed traumatic stress response. The authors present a case history of a 50‐year‐old woman who developed severe cognitive impairment following retrieval of previously forgotten memories of childhood sexual abuse. Her cognitive condition deteriorated rapidly and dramatically. Neuropsychological assessment and clinical presentation led to a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (vs. corticobasal degeneration). Detailed neurologic and medical evaluations could not identify any underlying physical cause. Her condition progressively worsened over 9 months, at which point memantine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist, was begun. The patient regained full functioning over the next year. Although an organic cause could not be ruled out, it was likely that recovery of traumatic memories was contributory to the patient's condition, as ongoing psychotherapy had begun 1 year into the course. If additional cases with similar presentations are reported, such cases would corroborate the notion that persistent, severe, and reversible cognitive impairment constitutes a previously unrecognized and atypical posttraumatic response.",

Diagnosis is made by clinical suspicion, distinctive clinical patterns and usually improvement in renal function on drug withdrawal. Conclusion A high index of suspicion is necessary to detect drug-induced renal disease particularly with increasing availability of over-the-counter drugs.

      "abstract": "Under observation there were 71 patients with reactive states developed in the presence of slowly progressing schizophrenia. Three types of the reactive depressions were distinguished: simple depressions following the line of psychogenically provoked endogenous phases; hysteric-type depressions, and reactive depressions with a polymorphous picture approaching schizophrenic reactions and being, in essence, psychogenically provoked schizophrenic episodes. It is shown that the level of the reactive lability and the time course of the reactive depressions is determined to a great measure by the degree of stabilization (or activity) of the endogenous process. In the period of stabilization (latent forms of schizophrenia, long-time remissions after an episode) the reactive states may be induced by a severe psychic trauma, and the time course of the depression, if the endogenous disturbances are added, remains within the limits of the phase. In the period of activation of the endogenous process the psychogenic depressions develop after relatively slight psychic traumas. In such cases, if the endogenous schizophrenic process is continuous, the reactive states become protracted and approach in their mechanisms to reactive development. In cases of \"schubweise\" schizophrenia the time course of the psychogenic reactions is confined to the limits of the episode.",

It is often precipitated by particularly strenuous activity, high-stress events, or coitus, but it can be seen with migraines as well. Studies have been inconclusive as to whether there are risk factors for the development of TGA, though some have suggested an association with a history of prior heart disease, migraine, or hyperlipidemia. Patients will often present with repetitive questioning and total anterograde memory loss that resolves within 24 hours. While there is disorientation with respect to other people and location, the patients will not lose self-awareness. The symptoms, once resolved, rarely recur and no other neurological deficits present with this condition. The diagnosis is largely a diagnosis of exclusion.",

Methods: The management of a patient presenting with atypical NMS without prominent rigidity, but with extensive rhabdomyolysis after the administration of haloperidol and ziprasidone is described in this report. Results: Prompt recognition of atypical features of NMS was managed by intensive care unit admission, supportive care and pharmacotherapy, leading to a complete resolution of the syndrome and a favorable outcome verified by laboratory findings. Conclusion: Early stages and atypical features of NMS may be variable in presentation and clinical course. The absence of muscle rigidity may not rule out NMS. A strong clinical suspicion based on clinical history is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment. Termination of dantrolene therapy may not be necessary during rhabdomyolysis and elevated aminotransferase levels.",

These symptoms are found to be independent from other symptoms in longitudinal and cross-sectional assesments. The negative symptoms are named as primary or idiopathic if they are present at beginning of the disease or if it is specific to the disease. If they are due to positive symptoms, drug adverse effects or depression they are named as secondary negative symptoms. Treatment approach depends on whether negative symptoms are primary or secondary. Deficit syndrome is described by primary negative symptoms presenting at the beginning of disease, emerging spontaneously and staying stable during the disease course. Recent reports showed that deficit syndrome differ on disease course based on neurocognitive measures, functioning, and structural imaging. The role of negative symptoms in clinical diversity of schizophrenia was aimed to be evaluated in this paper by elobarating negative symptoms in various dimensions such as clinical features, biological measures, quality of life, and response to treatment.",

      "title": "Seizure‐induced hippocampal damage in the mature and immature brain",
      "abstract": "Neurologists caring for patients who have experienced a first seizure or who are at increased risk of seizures are concerned with two questions. First, at what point do seizures lesion the brain and create the conditions for unprovoked, recurrent seizures, i.e. epilepsy. And second, seizure-induced changes can be prevented pharmacologically following an initial prolonged seizure, or prophylactically in individuals deemed at high risk of epilepsy? The number, duration and severity of seizures each influence the likelihood that an individual will experience chronic seizure-induced brain damage. However, the thresholds for deleterious seizure-induced sequelae are not well understood. Will repeated brief seizures produce similar changes as a single prolonged seizure? Do permanent alterations of neuronal function result from a single brief seizure? How long can neurons resist damage caused by prolonged seizures? These are all questions of immediate clinical significance. The anatomical, synaptic and functional consequences of seizures have been most extensively studied in the hippocampus, an epileptogenic structure that plays a central role in the generation of temporal lobe seizures. In this review, we will discuss the spectrum of known hippocampal alterations in epilepsy and highlight mechanisms through which neuronal and synaptic changes accrue. In addition to discussing the effects of prolonged seizures on the hippocampus, we will also review current data regarding the effects of repeated brief seizures as well as the effect of a single brief seizure. We will also discuss the relevance of development and gender on the manifestations of seizure-induced damage, in order to begin to stratify the risk of seizure sequelae to different human populations depending on age, and - to a lesser extent - on gender. The decision whether to treat, and how to treat seizures, results from an understanding of the immediate and long-term risks to the patient of either recurrent seizures, or of seizure-induced brain damage. Paradigmatic to this type of decision is the assessment of febrile seizures, a common occurrence in childhood. Current clinical and laboratory data indicate that simple febrile seizures do not result in long-term brain injury. However, novel laboratory findings indicate that even \"benign\" febrile seizures may produce subtle long-term changes in neuronal behavior - such as altered synaptic function. The improved understanding of the mechanism producing these long term effects is a necessary first step in the development of neuroprotective treatments that can be applied either in the acute setting at the time of an initial prolonged seizure, or prophylactically in individuals most likely to high risk of developing epilepsy.",

Regarding the disorder, the heterogeneous concept of major depressive disorder and the multiple definitions of treatment-resistant depression, hesitating between a categorical and a more dimensional approach, as well as the divergence between diagnostic criteria and the items in the assessment scales are a source of confusion. Classifications do not take into account the dramatic influence of patient characteristics strongly impacting outcome, although these can be the cause of so-called pseudo-resistance. Outcome is the result of spontaneous evolution, nonspecific factors (including placebo), and active treatment factors. These should be differentiated to have a reliable estimation of the impact of different treatment modalities before we can asses treatment-resistant depression or before we can ascertain the (non)efficacy of treatments for treatment-resistant depression.The impact and burden of major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression are immense and go far beyond their economic cost. It is often forgotten that both are not only associated with increased suicidality but also with nonsuicidal mortality and that both can even result in requests for assisted dying. The caregiver burden and associated stigma are also too often overlooked despite that it has been suggested that they do influence (treatment) outcome.",

These data indicate the difficulty to use the available cognitive resources of the patient. These alterations are similar to those present in other hypersomnias, although they might differ in intensity. Moreover, most of the studies emphasize a high prevalence of different depressive and anxious disorders. It has been suggested that predisposition to anxiety could be part of the characteristic phenotype of these patients. Anxiety could act either as a trigger for the disease or a consequence of the disease.Cognitive deficits in patients with NT1 appear in long lasting and/or monotonous tasks and in high cognitive demanding tasks. The presence of depressive symptomatology, together with excessive daytime sleepiness in these patients could affect their performance in neuropsychological test, and it might be related to their subjective perception of the cognitive deficits.Alteraciones neuropsicologicas en la narcolepsia con cataplejia: una revision.Objetivo.

Estos datos indican una dificultad para utilizar los recursos cognitivos de los que dispone el sujeto. Estas alteraciones son similares a las presentes en otras hipersomnias, aunque difieren en la intensidad. Por otra parte, la mayoria de los estudios destaca una elevada prevalencia de diferentes trastornos depresivos y ansiosos.

La ansiedad podria actuar como un factor desencadenante de la enfermedad y ser asimismo una consecuencia de la enfermedad. Conclusiones. Los deficits cognitivos en los pacientes con narcolepsia de tipo 1 se manifiestan en tareas de larga duracion o monotonas y en tareas con alta demanda cognitiva, principalmente en tareas de atencion sostenida. La presencia de sintomatologia depresiva en estos pacientes, junto con la excesiva somnolencia diurna, parecen afectar a su rendimiento en las pruebas neuropsicologicas, y estar estrechamente relacionadas con la apreciacion subjetiva de dificultades cognitivas.",

Tests can help ( Chapter 2), and there are operational criteria for mild, moderate and severe dementia ( Box 1.2), but the earlier the diagnosis of dementia is made, the more uncertain it will be.

      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

Doctors diagnose dementia based on careful processing medical\r\nhistory, physical examination, laboratory tests and characteristic changes in\r\nthinking. Those with high reliability may determine that a person has\r\ndementia, but it is much more difficult to determine the exact type of\r\ndementia because the symptoms and changes in the brain of various\r\ndementia may overlap. In some cases, your doctor may diagnose dementia\r\nbut does not specify the type of it.\r\nTreatment depends on the cause of dementia. In most cases,\r\nprogressive dementia has no cure, but there are medicines that can\r\ntemporarily alleviate symptoms. The effectiveness of new treatments\r\ndepends on expensive researches and clinical studies.",

Analizar la asociacion de las alteraciones neuropsicologicas a la epilepsia en la infancia buscando el origen en la fisiopatologia de la epilepsia como enfermedad neurologica y en las bases de la plasticidad cerebral adaptativa. Desarrollo. La existencia de descargas electricas, en ausencia o presencia de crisis clinicas, se relaciona con problemas atencionales, de memoria reciente, limitacion en las capacidades linguisticas, visuoespaciales y ejecutivas, con lentitud psicomotora, y determina dificultades de aprendizaje. La edad temprana de comienzo de la epilepsia, la etiologia secundaria, la refractariedad al tratamiento que condiciona la necesidad de una politerapia y la vivencia negativa de la enfermedad, influyen en la asociacion de alteraciones neuropsicologicas. El tipo de epilepsia que puede determinar la afectacion de funciones especificas, como la memoria, se ve afectada en las epilepsias parciales del lobulo temporal, y la atencion en las epilepsias generalizadas. Conclusiones. La epilepsia no solo se manifiesta con crisis epilepticas, y los ninos presentan sintomas asociados que hacen necesaria una valoracion neuropsicologica completa que debe incluir exploraciones de funciones cerebrales y especificas del hemisferio.",

Recent studies suggest that this impairment persists after cessation of use for periods up to at least one year. However, there is no clear indication as yet concerning which stage of memory processing is impaired as a result of MDMA use. In the current study, 31 current MDMA users and 30 MDMA users who had been abstinent for more than two years were compared with 30 controls on the WMS-III. The results suggest that MDMA use is associated with memory dysfunction and that this dysfunction persists for up to two years after cessation of use. Importantly, the findings suggest that this memory dysfunction may be due to interference at the encoding stage of memory processing.",

      "abstract": "When neurology and psychiatry moved apart from each other around the turn of the 20th century, casualties included the many patients with unexplained neurological disorders. Many labels have been applied to these patients. Some are descriptive (functional disorders, medically unexplained symptoms), while others refer to a presumed aetiology (psychogenic, hysteria, non-organic) or putative mechanism (dissociative or conversion disorder). Whatever is the label, for some physicians these patients are among the most interesting and challenging in the clinic. For others they are frustrating, using much time and resources for an often disappointing outcome.\n\nWhether you are an enthusiast or nihilist, it is clear that that neither neurology nor psychiatry alone have succeeded in sufficiently advancing our neurobiological understanding or management of these disorders. The slow progress is in stark contrast to the scale of the problem. Medically unexplained neurological symptoms account for ∼30% of referred neurology out-patients (Carson et al. , 2000; Stone et al. , 2009). Conversion disorder alone, explicitly associated with psychological stressors at the outset, accounts for ∼5% of referrals and is a stable, accurate diagnosis (Perkin, 1989; Stone et al. , 2005, 2009).\n\nPsychogenic movement disorders are common in neurological practice, including tremor, dystonia, gait change and paralysis. Diagnostic criteria emphasize clinical observations such as inconsistency, distractibility and false neurological signs (Fahn and Williams, 1988). These can be both sensitive and specific, at least in the context of a movement disorder clinic (Shill and Gerber, 2006). Physiological criteria have also been developed, such as coherence of tremor oscillations distinguishing psychogenic from organic syndromes (McAuley and Rothwell, 2004). The emphasis in this ‘neurological’ approach is on the physical examination, supplemented by physiological tests. The psychological aspects of the disease take second place, e.g. requiring ‘obvious’ but not specified psychiatric or emotional disturbance (Fahn and Williams, 1988 …",

      "abstract": "In the 60s of the last century, the terminology discirculatory encephalopathy was proposed, which is defined as a progressive disease that conducts cerebral circulation leading to a gradual deterioration in brain function. Irreversible lesions of the brain parenchyma, against the background of various multifactorial causes, lead to degeneration of brain structures, and subsequently to severe cognitive disorders. DE combines neurological, neuropsychological and mental disorders, in contrast to the term chronic cerebral ischemia, which assumes the presence of one mechanism of damage (l). At one time, cognitive impairments are field-etiological conditions characterized by a decrease in memory and mental performance, with the allocation of a certain level of impairment from mild to severe (dementia or dementia) (k). According to statistics, among neurological patients, moderate cognitive impairment occurs in about 45%. And if mild and moderate disorders can be restored or stabilized to some extent, then dementia is such a pronounced persistent process that interferes not only with social and professional activity, but is characterized by irreversible signs (l). On average, up to 7.5 million new cases of dementia are reported annually, each of which becomes a heavy burden on society. The incidence of dementia increases with age, respectively, an increase in life expectancy, in parallel, increases the numbers of cognitive impairment. In addition, the disease is often combined with many somatic diseases. Therefore, cognitive impairment is an interdisciplinary problem for many specialists and remains relevant, both for establishing a diagnosis and for developing the principles of a modern approach to the rehabilitation of DE patients with cognitive dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a serious and potentially fatal adverse effect of antipsychotic drugs. The diagnosis of NMS commonly requires core symptoms of hyperthermia and muscle rigidity. Although diagnostic criteria for NMS have been established and are widely accepted and used, it should be recognized that atypical presentations pose a diagnostic dilemma, as hyperthermia and/or muscle rigidity may be absent or develop slowly over several days, leading to impairment or a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment. Evidence from case reports and retrospective evaluations supports a concept of atypical NMS, particularly with regard to treatment with atypical antipsychotics. However, it remains unclear whether these atypical presentations represent early or impending NMS. Furthermore, it is unclear whether dysfunction in other neurotransmitter systems, in addition to dopamine, may be involved in the pathogenesis of NMS induced by atypical antipsychotics. In patients receiving any antipsychotic, clinicians should carefully evaluate any features of NMS and should not prematurely exclude a diagnosis of NMS in cases where severe rigidity or hyperthermia is not initially apparent.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), alone or in combination with other pathology, is the most common cause of dementia in people over age 65. The defining features of Alzheimer's dementia are progressive deficits in memory and other aspects of cognition, typically including language, praxis, visual and spatial processing, and executive function at some point during the course of the illness. Noncognitive phenomena, including apathy and unawareness, are important contributors to the burden of disease. At the same time, elemental neurological function, and therefore the general neurological exam, is usually normal, although paratonia and/or myoclonus may be present. These deficits result in reduced ability to perform daily activities, and most Alzheimer's dementia patients will become totally dependent on others unless they die of other causes first. The clinical presentation of Alzheimer's dementia is the result of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss that follow a predictable distribution in the brain. The hippocampus, limbic cortex, and polymodal association cortex sustain the greatest damage. Dysfunction in these regions results in the characteristic clinical pattern of Alzheimer's dementia and assists in its clinical differentiation from other dementing illnesses, which follow different anatomical patterns of neuronal dysfunction.",

ADHD is increasingly understood not only as a neurodevelopmental condition but also as one often marked by misalignment of internal circadian rhythms. This misalignment contributes to sleep disturbances, which in turn can aggravate core symptoms such as inattention, impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and executive dysfunction. CRD interferes with treatment in several ways. The circadian system influences how medications are absorbed and metabolized, meaning that individuals with disrupted rhythms may experience reduced efficacy or stronger side effects depending on the timing of administration. Sleep deprivation and altered melatonin cycles can further limit the benefits of stimulant treatments. ADHD frequently coexists with sleep and mood disorders, as well as metabolic disturbances, which make treatment more complex and call for individualized care. The effects of circadian disruption also change over the course of development: in early childhood, it can intensify hyperactivity; in school-age children, it can impair learning and attention; in adolescents, phase delays and poor sleep hygiene complicate medication timing; and in young adults, irregular routines often worsen circadian misalignment and treatment response. Addressing CRD is therefore essential for improving clinical outcomes. Interventions such as light therapy, melatonin supplementation, sleep-focused behavioral strategies, and timing medications in line with circadian patterns offer promising avenues for more effective, personalized ADHD treatment.",

      "title": "Neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome in bipolar disorder with psychosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Neuroleptics can induce not only physical adverse effects but also mental effects that produce deficit status in thought, affect, cognition, and behavior. This condition is known as neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome (NIDS), which includes apathy, lack of initiative, anhedonia, indifference, blunted affect, and reduced insight into disease. Although this old concept now appears almost forgotten, neuroleptics, whether typical or atypical, can make depression or bipolar disorder resemble other more refractory conditions, readily leading to mistaken diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. The authors describe three cases of NIDS superimposed on depressive phase in bipolar disorder with psychosis, where the attending psychiatrist’s failure to recognize NIDS prevented patients from receiving effective treatment and achieving remission. All cases achieved remission after reduction of neuroleptics and intensive therapy, including electroconvulsive therapy, for bipolar depression. The concept of NIDS was originally introduced for schizophrenia, and it has rarely been highlighted in other diseases. In recent years, however, atypical antipsychotics are being more often administered to patients with bipolar disorder. Psychiatrists, therefore, should also remember and exercise caution regarding NIDS in the pharmacotherapy of bipolar disorder with and without psychosis. The authors believe that the concept of NIDS needs to be reappraised in current psychiatry.

However, such declines must not be accepted as indisputable evidence that the learning efficiency of older adults is necessarily impaired. Cognitive factors such as a production deficiency in long‐term memory and/or a retrieval deficiency do operate to depress the performance of older adults. However, a number of noncognitive factors such as functional and pathological sensory deficits, psychomotor slowing, poor physical and mental health, and insufficient or excessively high motivation also mitigate against optimal performance in the aged. The learning efficiency of the aged may be improved through the use of teaching and learning techniques designed to compensate for the negative effects of both detrimental cognitive and noncognitive factors.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Chronic encephalopathies lead to dementia syndromes that develop over months or years in a setting of clear consciousness (Neary & Snowden 2002). By contrast, acute encephalopathies are neurological and neurosurgical emergencies associated with rapid and severe disturbance of consciousness over hours or days, causing delirium, stupor and ultimately coma (Bateman 2001). Subacute encephalopathies are in between – impaired consciousness develops insidiously over weeks or months. The term ‘confusional state’ is applicable to subacute encephalopathies. However, the clinician may also be confused. For example, patients with chronic dementia are sometimes inappropriately described as ‘confused’, while patients who are in a genuine confusional state may not be recognized as such. Diagnostic mistakes are particularly likely in older people who are sometimes thought, even nowadays, to be inherently senile and demented. Moreover, the situation is complicated by the fact that people who do have dementia may develop transient confusional states following acute perturbations",

In other instances, especially when the discharges are more atypical, the psychic disturbances may take on the character of either a simple worsening of behavior or of a confusional state with agitation and delirium, or of a stuporous state. The temporal lobe statuses, which are much more rare, manifest themselves either as a succession of psychomotor attacks, or as protracted confusional or confusooneiric episodes. An EEG makes it possible, at any rate, to differentiate between the petit mal statuses and the temporal lobe statuses.

      "abstract": "In an increasingly ageing society, patients ageing with epilepsy and those with late-onset epilepsies (LOE) represent a challenge for epilepsy care and treatment. Senescence itself bears risks of pathologies which in the form of acute focal damage (e.g. stroke) or slowly progressive degenerative damage can cause seizures and substantial cognitive impairment. There is converging evidence from studies in LOE that cognitive impairments are present from epilepsy onset before treatment is initiated and may even precede the emergence of seizures. This suggests that these impairments (like the seizures) are expressions of the underlying disease. Indeed, both seizures and cognitive impairments can be early indicators of disease conditions which lead to mental decline. Cognitive decline over time poses the challenge of disentangling the interrelation between seizures, treatment effects and underlying disease. This issue must be considered as some of the etiologies for causing neuropsychological decline can be addressed. Medication and active epilepsy can contribute to impairments and their impact may be reversible. Dementia is rare if seizures are what has brought the person to attention, and if this is not accompanied by other slowly developing features (such as cognitive of psychiatric changes). From a neuropsychological point of view choosing the right screening tools or assessments, obtaining the history and timeline of impairments in relation to epilepsy, and most importantly longitudinally following the patients regardless of whether epilepsy is ultimately controlled or not appear essential.",

      "abstract": "Rolandic epilepsy or benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is called benign because its seizures are usually favourable and due to the spontaneous normalisation of the electroencephalogram on reaching puberty. Nevertheless, evidence has been found of the impact on cognitive development with the presence of heterogeneous cognitive deficits, especially related to persistent intercritical discharges during non-REM sleep. The aim of this study is to examine the epileptogenic networks involved in the neuropsychological disorders of this pathology.A common feature of the atypical developments is persistent epileptic activity during slow sleep, which plays an important role in the development of the neurocognitive deficits that are associated to this pathology. Factors such as the age at onset of the epilepsy, the onset of the atypical development, the location of the interictal discharges and the continuous epileptic activity during sleep that persists for more than two years can trigger changes in the functioning of the neurocognitive networks. This may result in deficits in the neuropsychological functions, which may even be irreversible.A close clinical and electroencephalographic follow-up is necessary. Moreover, formal neuropsychological studies must be conducted as of the onset of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. This is even more necessary in cases in which there is an obvious atypical development in order to detect and prevent the neuropsychological deficits before they establish themselves on a definitive basis.Las alteraciones neuropsicologicas son frecuentes en la epilepsia rolandica y sus evoluciones atipicas.Introduccion. La epilepsia rolandica o epilepsia benigna de la infancia con puntas centrotemporales se denomina benigna debido a lo favorables que suelen ser sus crisis y a la espontanea normalizacion del electroencefalograma al llegar a la pubertad, aunque se ha demostrado el impacto sobre el desarrollo cognitivo con la presencia de deficits cognitivos heterogeneos, relacionados especialmente con las descargas intercriticas persistentes durante el sueño no REM. El objetivo de este trabajo es estudiar las redes epileptogenas involucradas en los trastornos neuropsicologicos de esta patologia. Desarrollo. Las evoluciones atipicas tienen en comun una actividad epileptica persistente durante el sueño lento, que desempeña un papel importante en el desarrollo de los deficits neurocognitivos que se asocian a esta patologia. Factores como la edad de inicio de la epilepsia, el inicio de la evolucion atipica, la localizacion de las descargas interictales y la actividad epileptica continua durante el sueño que persista durante mas de dos años pueden provocar cambios en el funcionamiento de las redes neurocognitivas, con los consecuentes deficits en las funciones neuropsicologicas, que incluso pueden resultar irreversibles. Conclusiones. Es necesario un seguimiento cercano tanto clinico como electroencefalografico; ademas, deben realizarse estudios neuropsicologicos formales desde el inicio de la epilepsia benigna de la infancia con puntas centrotemporales y mas en los casos que es evidente una evolucion atipica para detectar y prevenir los deficits neuropsicologicos antes de que se instauren definitivamente.",

It is observed at the initial stage, at the peak intensity of depressive symptoms and even after their reduction, which leads to the persistence of residual depressive state. Cognitive impairment during the depressive episode can be detected by objective methods (clinical and neuropsychological), and their subjective importance is being revealed by standardized questionnaires. Depressed patients show lower results in executive functions, working memory, reaction speed, verbal learning, immediate and delayed recall subtests of neuropsychological batteries. There are few pharmacological agents (mostly antidepressants) with well-proven procognitive activity in depression. Besides, some new pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches for treatment of cognitive impairment in depression have appeared lately and are described in literature as promising.",

In this article the clinical symptoms and signs of the successive phases of a syncopal episode are reviewed. A failure of the systemic circulation to perfuse the brain sufficiently results in a stereotyped progression of neurological symptoms and signs culminating in loss of consciousness; when transient, this is syncope. Prior to loss of consciousness the affected individual tends to exhibit unclear thinking, followed by fixation of the eyes in the midline and a 'frozen' appearance. Narrowing of the field of vision with loss of colour vision ('greying' out) and finally a complete loss of vision (hence 'blacking' out) occurs. Hearing loss may occur following loss of vision. This process may take as little as approximately 7 s in cases of sudden complete circulatory arrest (e.g. abrupt asystole), but in other circumstances it may take longer depending on the rate and depth of cerebral hypoperfusion. Complete loss of consciousness occurs with the 'turning up' of the eyeballs. Profound cerebral hypoperfusion may be accompanied by myoclonic jerks.",

It is a serious disorder which can lead to persistent suffering, increased mortality, from both suicide and general medical causes, and poorer overall health. Although presenting symptoms are similar in all age groups there are different aetiological pathways. In older people the waning effect of genetic predisposition to affective disorder may be replaced by subcortical brain abnormalities of presumed vascular aetiology. These may influence prognosis. Depression in later life is often under-diagnosed and under-treated; these two factors are the main hurdles to an improved prognosis. Antidepressant treatment should be tailored to the patient and works best when combined with psychological therapy, but the latter treatment modality is woefully neglected in later life psychiatry. Improvements in prognosis are unlikely to come from new revolutionary treatments but from vigorous treatment in the acute phase, continuation after recovery for at least 12-18 months and long-term maintenance treatment for those at high risk of recurrence.",

The nature of convulsive movements in dissociative seizures often differs from that in epilepsy, and long duration of individual events, waxing and waning, closed eyes and high reported frequency in an apparently well individual are all suggestive. In those with stroke-like episodes, demonstration of normal power even briefly (eg Hoover's sign, 'give way' weakness) together with distractability are positive physical features indicating a functional disorder.

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatment of Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms may be the primary characteristic of a specific disorder such as schizophrenia, occur secondary to a mood disorder such as major depression, or be due to a known causative factor such as a drug-induced paranoid reaction. Schizophrenia is the best studied disorder in terms of pharmacological treatment, and schizoaffective disorder is often included in these medication trials. Although antipsychotics have often been prescribed for major mood disorders with psychotic features, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has dramatically expanded their approved uses in recent years. Several of these agents are now indicated for bipolar and unipolar disorders, even in the absence of psychosis. Antipsychotics are also often prescribed off-label, but limited data are available to guide their appropriate use. For example, they are widely administered to older patients experiencing behavioral disturbances or psychosis associated with dementia. The potential risks of such off-label use are underscored by an FDA-mandated box warning for all antipsychotics, primarily due to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and the related morbidity and mortality. Because individuals with schizophrenia may experience subtle changes in behavior and cognition for long periods prior to their first acute psychotic episode, early diagnosis and intervention are increasingly emphasized. Recognition of impending or subtle signs of psychosis and introduction of an antipsychotic to reduce duration of untreated symptoms may have a substantial impact on long-term outcome. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that limiting the duration of untreated psychosis to less than 9 months was associated with a substantially greater reduction in negative symptoms (Boonstra et al. 2012). Imaging studies indicate that during the early years after illness onset, a subset of patients with schizophrenia may demonstrate significant decreases in gray matter and white matter, as well as increases in cerebrospinal fluid (Andreasen et al. 2011). The use of antipsychotic drugs in this population, however, is complicated by conflicting reports of an association between exposure to them and either neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects (Lewis 2011). Although antipsychotic drug therapy is used for several FDA-approved and unapproved indications, the existing evidence base for these medications is strongest for their role in managing multiple-episode schizophrenia, which is the focus of this chapter. (For management of first-episode patients, see Chapter 8, \"Early-Stage Schizophrenia.\") In this chapter, data for both acute and long-term management are considered. Because inadequate response and treatment resistance are common in this population, strategies to augment standard antipsychotics or to serve as alternatives are also reviewed.

      "abstract": "The onset of disorders such as stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often sudden but is frequently followed by persistent and disabling long-term neuropsychiatric consequences. Few posttraumatic neuropsychiatric symptoms and syndromes are more disruptive to interpersonal familial, societal, educational, and occupational functioning and activities than agitation, aggression, and violent behaviors. Agitation and irritability that occur in a patient during the acute stages of recovery from TBI not only endanger the safety of the patient and his or her caregivers but also predict increased lengths of hospital stay and impaired cognition (Bogner et al. 2001). As recovery continues, low frustration tolerance and explosive behavior may develop in response to minimal provocation or sometimes may occur without any warning at all. These behaviors may be limited to irritability or may include violent outbursts resulting in damage to property or assaults on others. In severe cases, it may be unsafe for individuals with aggressive disorders to remain in the community or with their families, and referral to long-term psychiatric or neurobehavioral facilities is sometimes required. All clinicians, and especially mental health professionals, need to be knowledgeable about and able to evaluate and treat neurologically induced agitation, irritability, aggression, and violence among their patients with TBI.",

      "title": "What Are Realistic Treatment Goals? Lingering Symptoms Require You to Evaluate Pharmacotherapy and Offer Psychosocial Interventions",
      "abstract": "The course of chronic psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, differs from chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes. Some patients with chronic psychiatric conditions achieve remission and become symptom-free, while others continue to have lingering signs of disease for life. Residual symptoms of schizophrenia are not fully defined in the literature, which poses a challenge because they are central in the overall treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. (1) During this phase of schizophrenia, patients continue to have symptoms after psychosis has subsided. These patients might continue to have negative symptoms such as social and emotional withdrawal and low energy. Although frank psychotic behavior has disappeared, the patient might continue to hold strange beliefs. Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment option for psychiatric conditions, but the psychosocial aspect may have greater importance when treating residual symptoms and patients with chronic psychiatric illness. (2) A naturalistic study in Germany evaluated the occurrence and characteristics of residual symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. (3) The authors used a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale symptom severity score >1 for those purposes, which is possibly a stringent criterion to define residual symptoms. This multicenter study enrolled 399 individuals age 18 to 65 with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. (3) Of the 236 patients achieving remission at discharge, 94% had at least 1 residual symptom and 69% had at least 4 residual symptoms. Therefore, residual symptoms were highly prevalent in remitted patients. The most frequent residual symptoms were: * blunted affect * conceptual disorganization * passive or apathetic social withdrawal * emotional withdrawal * lack of judgment and insight * poor attention * somatic concern * difficulty with abstract thinking * anxiety * poor rapport. (3) Of note, positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinatory behavior, were found in remitted patients at discharge (17% and 10%, respectively). The study concluded that the severity of residual symptoms was associated with relapse risk and had an overall negative impact on the outcome of patients with schizophrenia. (3) The study noted that residual symptoms may be greater in number or volume than negative symptoms and questioned the origins of residual symptoms because most were present at baseline in more than two-third of patients. Patients with residual symptoms of schizophrenia usually are older and therefore present specific management challenges for clinicians. Changes associated with aging, such as medical problems, cognitive deficits, and lack of social support, could create new care needs for this patient population. Although the biopsychosocial model used to treat chronic psychiatric conditions, especially schizophrenia, is preferred, older schizophrenia patients with residual symptoms often need more psychosocial interventions compared with young adults with schizophrenia. Managing residual symptoms in schizophrenia Few studies are devoted to pharmacological treatment of older adults with schizophrenia, likely because pharmacotherapy for older patients with schizophrenia can be challenging. Evidence-based treatment is based primarily on findings from younger patients who survived into later life. Clinicians often use the adage of geriatric psychiatry, start low, go slow, because older patients are susceptible to adverse effects associated with psychiatric medications, including cardiovascular, metabolic, anticholinergic, and extrapyramidal effects, orthostasis, sedation, falls, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Older patients with schizophrenia are at an increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and anticholinergic adverse effects, perhaps because of degeneration of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. …",

Whereas the acute or hypermetabolic phase is characterized by elevated circulating concentration of catabolic hormones and substrate utilization to provide energy to vital organs, the prolonged or catabolic phase of critical illness is marked by reduced endocrine stimulation and severe loss of body cell mass. The most common analgesic and sedative agents used in the intensive care unit, if used in small or moderate doses, do not interfere significantly with the metabolic milieu; however, prolonged infusions, and in high doses, without adequate monitoring of level of sedation and quality of analgesia, can precipitate morbid events. Further research is needed in the metabolic aspects of analgesia and sedation in the intensive care unit, particularly if a multimodal pharmacologic strategy is used whereby multiple interventions aim at minimizing the risk of overdosing and contributing to attenuation of the stress response associated with critical illness.",

      "abstract": "Een hoog niveau van neuroticisme is een belangrijke risico factor voor zowel psychische als lichamelijke problemen. Bovendien is neuroticisme niet alleen geassocieerd met problemen op het gebied van persoonlijk welbevinden maar ook met substantiele kosten voor de maatschappij. Het is daarom belangrijk om zowel de oorzaken als de gevolgen van neuroticisme beter te begrijpen. Gedrags-genetische studies suggereren dat ongeveer de helft van de verschillen tussen mensen in neuroticisme veroorzaakt wordt door omgevingsinvloeden. In dit proefschrift heb ik onderzocht welke levensgebeurtenissen voorafgaan aan veranderingen in neuroticisme, en hoe lang zulke veranderingen aanhouden. Hiertoe heb ik een aantal longitudinale studies uitgevoerd en de literatuur betreffende veranderingen in neuroticisme in volwassenen samengevat. De resultaten laten zien dat stressvolle levensgebeurtenissen (in het bijzonder sociale stress en conflict), die gekarakteriseerd kunnen worden als onvoorspelbaar, oncontroleerbaar, onverwacht, onwenselijk, of niet passend bij de normale levensloop, vaak worden gevolgd door een langdurige toename in neuroticisme. Echter, positieve levensveranderingen kunnen ook leiden tot een afname van neuroticisme. Daarnaast heb ik de betekenis onderzocht van de relatie tussen neuroticisme en veelvoorkomende psychische problemen, zoals angst, depressie, en middelenmisbruik. De resultaten laten zien dat neuroticisme een belangrijke voorspeller is voor de ontwikkeling van veelvoorkomende psychische problemen, en tot op zekere hoogte gezien kan worden als een maat voor meer milde problemen. De conclusie van dit proefschrift is dat het neuroticisme niveau van mensen mede afhankelijk is van zijn of haar omgeving, gevoelig is voor positieve en negatieve levensgebeurtenissen, consequenties heeft voor psychische gezondheid, en veranderlijker is dan lang werd gedacht.",

Common sleep issues include chronic insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, and sleep-disordered breathing. Diagnostic tools, such as a comprehensive sleep history and questionnaires, or a sleep log for more specific complaints, are commonly used. Polysomnography is not recommended as a routine test; however, it can be used for abnormal behaviors during sleep or if treatment fails. Sleep disorder management is based on the etiology and may include nonpharmacological and pharmacological alternative treatments. For example, nonpharmacological management for chronic insomnia and some sleep disorders may consist of cognitive behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene education, relaxation therapy, sleep restriction, light therapy, and stimulus control therapy. Because the quality of evidence for pharmacological treatment is poor, the medication choice should be based on shared decision-making between the practitioner and the patient, with limited prescription.",

It becomes more fragmented as we age, with more night‐time awakenings and greater tendency for daytime sleep. The magnitude of disordered sleep among individuals affected by dementia has been clearly demonstrated, and disturbed sleep is a major clinical problem in dementia. Comorbid insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, such A lzheimer's disease and other dementing disorders. How and when sleep problems manifest themselves can depend on the type of dementia involved as well as the stage of the dementia. However, differences in sleep pattern presentation show more variation during the initial stages of dementias than they do during the later stages. Effective, pragmatic interventions are largely anecdotal and untested.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews the current studies on the mechanism of nicotine dependence. In the process of nicotine dependence, there are four major determinants: reinforcing effects, tolerance, craving and withdrawal. 1) The positive reinforcing effects of nicotine are important especially for the initiation of nicotine self-administration. These effects are considered to be induced by the ability of nicotine to promote the release of catecholamines, acetylcholine, beta-endorphine, glucocorticoid, and other kinds of hormones. 2) However, tolerance gradually develops to the positive reinforcing effects of nicotine, as nicotine is repeatedly self-administered. 3) Craving is defined as the uncontrollability of the urge to take drugs, which is a core aspect of recent ICD-10 or DSM-IV descriptions. Craving for nicotine is caused and enhanced by the following three factors; psychic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, depression and dysphoria, conditioning processes leading to the association of nicotine effects with environmental stimuli, and memory of the reinforcing effects of nicotine. 4) Neither somatic withdrawal symptoms nor mental disorders related to nicotine dependence is significant. 5) As for the neurobiology of nicotine dependence, the reward system is focused as a putative responsible region involved not only in the reinforcing effects of nicotine but also in the psychic withdrawal symptoms. The amygdala-nucleus accumbens connection may be intimately involved in the association between nicotine effects and environmental stimuli. And neuronal circuits involved in memory function may be implicated in the manifestation of craving and relapse, but the details remain to be solved.",

Acute pain is experienced for short time (two weeks) due to trauma while chronic pain last longer than three months and is associated with injury to tissues or nerves. There are four factors that commonly affect pain expressions: Location, Duration, Intensity and Etiology. The location is the place where the pain occurs. Duration is the time that pain lasts, and is classified as chronic or acute. Intensity tells how severe the pain is. It is usually measured through a pain scale from zero to ten.

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Clinicians are commonly confronted with the differential diagnosis of altered mental status, impaired cognition and altered level of consciousness in hospitalized patients including those admitted to medical, geriatric, emergency, intensive and post-operative care units. Although delirium is the most common acute neuropsychiatric condition in the acute hospital setting this diagnosis is commonly delayed, made too late or missed altogether. Difficulties and importance of timely diagnosis The causes of delirious states are manifold. Both, direct damage to the brain tissue as well as encephalopathy as a result of other medical diseases, can be the cause of delirium. Depending on the predisposition delirious syndromes can be provoked by minor medical interventions. Clinical presentation is very variable, but remains largely independent of the triggering mechanisms. Purely catatonic, hypoactive, hyperactive and excitatory types as well as mixed forms can be distinguished. Immediate diagnosis of a delirious syndrome and rapid elucidation of its causes are keys for the implementation of curative therapy. There is a need to act fast because delirious phases are associated with significantly longer hospital stay and increased morbidity as a result of long-term cognitive deficits as well as increased mortality. As negative outcome is closely linked to the duration of a delirious episode, early diagnosis and rapid termination of the delirium constitute a significant positive predictor of outcome. In this respect, delirium represents an emergency, with or without concomitant cerebral or extracerebral symptoms.",

The most prominent symptoms are as follows: hyperthermia, muscular rigidity, vegetative dysfunction and disturbance in consciousness. MNS usually occurs unexpectedly and unpredictably during the first days of the treatment with neuroleptics and most frequently it takes a remarkably rapid course. About 15-20% of the cases are lethal. The aim of the successful treatment is the early recognition of MNS preferably in the prodromal phases which can by the employment of adequate therapy interfere the evolution into the full clinical picture, i.e. to the lethal outcome. Efficient therapy includes: 1) interruption in the administration of neuroleptics, 2) regulation of water disbalance and electrolyte metabolism, 3) application of drugs which activate dopaminergine transmission insufficiency (bromocriptine, predominantly) or other disturbances induced by it in other neuronal systems which is obtained by the administration of anticholinergic antiparkinsonics and benzodiazepines (GABA effect), and 4) electroconvulsion. All aspects of MNS from the standpoint of actual level of knowledge are presented in this paper. The authors' own experience with the nine MNS cases registered at their clinic is also set forth. By the improvement in diagnostic and therapy no death due to MNS has been observed over the last few years.",

      "abstract": "Common, noncentral nervous system medical conditions linked with cognitive impairment in adults and the elderly include: acute respiratory distress syndrome; cancer; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; coronary heart disease; hypertension; obesity (bariatric surgical candidates); obstructive sleep apnea; and type 2 diabetes. Cross-condition comparison of the nature and frequency of cognitive impairment is difficult as these conditions often coexist, and there exists no consensus as to the definition of cognitive impairment, nor the optimal number and type of neuropsychological tests required for evaluation. There is as yet no clear evidence for condition-specific profiles of cognitive impairment. Rather, a generalized profile consisting of subclinical levels of impairment in attention, processing speed, executive, and memory functions from bilateral frontal-subcortical ischemia fits across all conditions. This profile: occurs only in subgroups of patients; is inconsistently related to measures of illness severity; is unrelated to patient self-report or level of functional independence; is exacerbated by very high levels of emotional distress; and is reversible in some cases but can also progress to frank neurological disease (dementia) in others, especially the elderly, when multiple conditions coexist, and/or when medical condition severity progresses.",

This report is concerned with secondary effects. Neuropsychiatric complications of underlying disease may vary widely from mild aberrations of normal mood and behavior to sweeping disturbances that dominate the entire clinical picture and may obscure the disease itself.

However, the sexual problems affecting women with neurological disease are not well described. The etiology of female sexual dysfunction in neurological conditions is multifactorial. There are both psychological and physiological etiologies that can be difficult to separate. The more common psychological problems arise from difficulty adapting to a chronic, and sometimes progressive, illness. Physiological causes of sexual dysfunction in neurological disease include disruption of regions of the cerebral cortex mediating sexual behavior and response; neuroendocrine or neurochemical dysfunction; and motor, sensory, or autonomic neuropathy Sexual dysfunction may be a consequence of the neurological disease or the pharmacologic therapy. Female sexual dysfunction in neurological conditions affecting primarily the autonomic nervous system has not been well studied. It is important for physicians to recognize symptoms of sexual dysfunction since there are treatments available that can improve the patient's quality of life.",

Both old and new antiepileptic drugs may exacerbate seizures, but carbamazepine-induced generalized seizures (such as absence and myoclonic) are best documented. More than one pathophysiological mechanism is probably involved in drug-related exacerbation of seizures, such as sedative and pro-convulsive effects of high serum levels, drug-associated encephalopathy, and a paradoxical pharmacodynamic effect. Accurate epilepsy- and seizure classification is important in the treatment of all types of epilepsy. Atypical absences are sometimes mistaken for complex partial seizures. Such patients may be given drugs with a narrow spectrum such as sodium channel blockers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine) or GABAergic agents (e.g. vigabatrin, tiagabine) with an increased risk of seizure exacerbation. Those at greatest risk of experiencing drug-related seizure exacerbation are learning-disabled patients, children with severe epileptic encephalopathies, those with high seizure frequency and several seizure types, and those using polytherapy.",

Epidemiology PrevalenceThe prevalence of delirium varies with the population that is being studied (Fong et al., 2009).Delirium is a relatively common disorder, especially in older people with physical illness (Saxena & Lawley, 2009).Community rates of delirium are reported to vary from 0.4% to 2% (Saxena & Lawley, 2009, Fong et al., 2009).In general hospital setting prevalence of delirium has been reported to range from 11% to 33% on admission (Lindesay et al.,",

It is usually a chronic condition that can be difficult to treat because standard treatment with conventional analgesics does not typically provide effective relief of pain. Patients with neuropathic pain commonly present to primary care professionals, but making a diagnosis may be difficult. Neuropathic pain is usually associated with substantially greater impairment of quality of life compared with other types of chronic pain, and the disorder is a large cost burden on healthcare services. In this review, we provide an overview of published evidence to help clinicians recognise and manage patients with neuropathic pain.\n\nA group of specialists of the International Association for the Study of Pain defines neuropathic pain as “pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.”1 In contrast to inflammatory or nociceptive pain, which is caused by actual tissue damage or potentially tissue damaging stimuli, neuropathic pain is produced either by damage to, or pathological change in, the peripheral or central nervous system, the system that normally signals pain. As such, the term neuropathic pain represents a varying set of symptoms rather than a single diagnosis.\n\nDamage to the somatosensory system can provoke a range of responses; an absence of sensation and pain is probably a more common response than new onset of …",

      "title": "A Case of Transient Global Amnesia due to Marijuana Use",
      "abstract": "Transient amnesia is a temporary version of the amnestic syndrome. The most striking example of transient amnesia is the transient global amnesia (TGA) syndrome which lasts from several to 24 hours, with or without retrograde components of impairment, and any signs of neurological deficit in nature. In this syndrome, an otherwise cognitively intact individual suddenly loses memory of recent events, asks repetitive questions about his/her environment, and sometimes confabulates (1). TGA is typically described as amnesia of sudden onset regarding events of the present and the recent past (2). It can be caused by central vascular or ischemic lesions. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but includes laboratory tests and radiologic evaluation. TGA typically remits spontaneously, but may recur. There is no specific treatment for amnesia. General stabilization of the patient is indicated (2). Many patients are anxious or agitated and may repeatedly ask questions concerning transpiring events. In the neurologic examination only disturbed memory can be found (3). Upon mental status examination, language function is preserved, which indicates a preservation of semantic and syntax memory. Attention is spared, visual-spatial skills are intact, and social skills are retained. Symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. As the syndrome resolves, the amnesia improves, but the patient may be left with a distinct lapse of recollection for events during the attack. The patient’s behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about his/her immediate circumstances (e.g., “What am I doing here?”; “How did we get here?”) (4). Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most potent effects on shortterm episodic and working memory in humans (5). Marijuana is used by inhalation in cigars or taken orally. When it is taken by the oral route its effects are seen in a delayed manner, so the inhalation type is used mostly to achieve the desired psychoactive effects (6). After al the cigar was burnt, the peak effects are seen in 20 minutes and disappear in 3 hours. A cigar of marijuana contains 5-20 mg THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Approximately 50% of the THC pass to the alveolar spaces. The most encountered psychotropic side effects of THC are; lethargy, sedation, euphoria, psychological relaxation, euphoria and sometimes, inhibition of the psychological inhibitions as alcohol does, disturbance in the perception of time and location (like feeling of delays in time and elongation of the distances), disturbance in the Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) has been a well-described phenomenon for more than 40 years. It presents with a paroxysmal, transient loss of memory. Immediate recall ability and remote memory are preserved. However, patiens experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. In some cases, the degree of retrograde memory loss is mild. Marijuana induced transient global amnesia is a rare side effect. Here, we present a case of memory loss for a short period of time after use of marijuana. (JAEM 2012; 11: 190-2)",

Treatment programs that focus only on reducing intake to a moderate level of consumption are not effective for alcoholics with a severe physical dependency. In the early stages of an addiction, however, when the first signs of addiction are present but there are no indications of severe physical or psychological dependency, minimizing the consumption of alcohol to a moderate level can be a possible alternative to total abstinence for many patients. Addictions are chronic, highly complex disorders with a multifactoral genesis.

The consequences of these sleep disturbances on everyday activities are not well documented and are therefore not considered in the evaluation of independence in activities of daily living ( ADL s). The goal of this narrative review is to explore the consequences of poor sleep quality on cognition and ADL s in the acute and subacute stages of a moderate and severe TBI , when patients are in acute care or inpatient rehabilitation. Methods We will present an overview of normal sleep and its role in cognitive functioning, and then present the findings of studies that have investigated sleep characteristics in hospital settings and the consequences of sleep disturbances on ADL s. Results During hospitalisation, TBI patients present severe sleep disturbances such as insomnia and sleep fragmentation, which are probably influenced by both the medical condition and the hospital or rehabilitation environment. Sleep disruption is associated with several cognitive deficits, including attention, memory and executive function impairments. Poor quality and/or insufficient quantity of sleep in acute TBI probably affect general functioning and ADL s calling for these cognitive functions. Conclusions and Significance The cognitive impairments present following TBI are probably exacerbated by poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation during hospitalisation, which in turn impact ADL s among this population. Health‐care personnel should further consider sleep disturbances among people with TBI and a sleep protocol should be established.",

Many psychotropic drugs and their active metabolites, if any, have very long half-lives that extend for 2 days or longer. Examples are chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, fluoxetine, vortioxetine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, penfluridol, donepezil, and memantine. Other drugs with long half-lives that psychiatrists may prescribe include levothyroxine and zonisamide. Psychotropic drugs with long half-lives take long to reach steady state; this is seldom a problem. They also take long to wash out; this is an advantage because the risk of drug withdrawal or discontinuation syndromes is small, and a disadvantage if rapid washout is desired for any reason, including the experience of drug adverse effects or toxicity, or the discovery of an unplanned pregnancy. Other clinical issues related to drugs with long half-lives include the relevance of occasional missed doses, the possibility of once-weekly dosing, and the need for pregnancy planning.",

      "title": "Putting the pieces together: The subjective experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder",
      "abstract": "Throughout the history of psychology there is evidence of fragmentation, at multiple levels. As a result of this fragmentation knowledge of mental illness exists in the form of separate fragments or pieces, and the understanding of the subjective experience of a mental illness as a whole is often lost in the pieces. Such fragmentation is a concern as it has a significant impact on those suffering from a mental illness, as they may not feel understood, or aspects of their experience of mental illness may be missed or overlooked. Thus potentially reducing the individual's ability and willingness to approach and engage in treatment, reducing the possible efficacy of treatment and increasing the risk of relapse. The experience of not feeling understood, difficulties engaging in treatment and relapse are particularly common for individuals with anorexia nervosa, a disorder which has markedly been prey to the fragmentation in psychology. These experiences are concerning when one considers that anorexia nervosa is a chronic disorder, associated with severe physical and psychological consequences, including death, due to physical complications or suicide. The impact of the disorder stems beyond the individual, with families and care-givers also experiencing high levels of distress. Due to the risk, severity and chronic nature of anorexia nervosa, it is important that understanding of the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa is increased to foster research, development and implementation of efficacious interventions. These concerns led to the research question guiding this research: what is the human subjective experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder? The purpose of a broad research question was to maximize the pieces of experience gathered, as well as establish the context of experiences, and thereby gathering a picture of the subjective experience of the disorder in its complexity.;As a vast array of, albeit fragmented, knowledge exists on anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder, theories and hypotheses from the literature were used as points of triangulation. In order to capture the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa qualitative methodology was used, and 15 self defined recovered sufferers of anorexia nervosa were interviewed. During the interview, participants were asked to describe their experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder, as well as comment on the perceived relevance of theory and hypotheses (or pieces of knowledge) from four different orientations (biological, social-cognitive, family and existential) that exist in the field. Data analysis involved gathering pieces from theory and participant experience, organizing these pieces, and working up from the data to establish a picture of an individual's experience at the different stages of the disorder, and how this changes over time. As the research was exploring both what is the subjective experience, and how it changes over time, data analysis was guided by both phenomenological and grounded theory methodology. An adapted form of Heidegger's (1962) worlds of being was also used, to assist organization of pieces, based on where the experience was in relation to the individual. From this analysis a Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, as well as phases of maintenance and recovery, were developed that meaningfully tie together pieces of experience, to capture the complex subjective experience of anorexia nervosa at different stages, and how an individual moves through the stages. The Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, and accompanying phases increase the understanding of the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa, and have the capacity to assist research, development and implementation of efficacious treatment.;The development of the Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, and accompanying phases, also acts as a small step towards resolving the issue of fragmentation, and recapturing the subjective experience of mental illness.",

What the authors observed was the same spectrum of psychic symptoms repeatedly reported from withdrawal reactions to alcohol or other sedativehypnotic drugs. \"Acute brain syndrome due to drug withdrawal\" is a much more precise phrase. Psychotic symptoms have not been prominent in the relatively few withdrawal reactions to benzodiazepines reported in the medical literature since our first experimental study (<i>Psychopharmacologia</i>2:63-68, 1961). These reactions are modified in severity and attenuated over time because of the long persistence of the drug and its active metabolites in the body. Withdrawal reactions are dependent on high dosage of drug sustained rather constantly over time, with rapid rate of disappearance of the drug when it is discontinued.

      "abstract": "Time for primary review 28 days.\n\nMore than any other organ of the body, brain integrity depends on the continuous blood supply of oxygen and glucose for covering the energy demands of the tissue. Cessation or severe reduction of blood flow results in almost instantaneous biochemical and functional deficits which become rapidly irreversible unless blood flow is promptly restored. The ischemia time that is tolerated by the brain depends, among others, on the density of ischemia, the tissue concentration of primary and secondary energy stores and the rate of energy consumption which, in turn, depends on the temperature, the degree of functional activity and the absence or presence of anesthetics and other drugs. There is also a major difference between the ischemic vulnerability of different regions of the brain. As an example, the CA1 sector of hippocampus may suffer irreversible injury after ischemia of as short as 5 min [94]whereas other nerve cell populations survive normothermic cerebrocirculatory arrest of as long as 1 h [77].\n\nThe pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia is further complicated by the fact that the severity of cell injury is modulated by numerous indirect or secondary consequences of the primary ischemic impact. Recirculation disturbances, stress responses, peroxidative changes, or the activation of genomic responses are only few examples of the large number of hemodynamic and molecular responses which determine the final outcome [153, 97]. The interpretation of experimental data of cerebral ischemia, therefore, requires intimate knowledge of the models and conditions under which the data have been collected. The number and diversity of such models, has become very large over the years because researchers have sought in vain for the ideal approach to study ischemic injury and its therapeutic reversal. Such an ideal model should be relevant to the clinical situation, it should be … \n\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +49 (221) 4726 211; Fax: +49 (221) 4726 325; E-mail: hossmann@mpin-koeln.mpg.de",

      "abstract": "Super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) is a life-threatening neurological emergency with high morbidity and mortality. It is defined as \"status epilepticus (SE) that continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the onset of anesthesia, including those cases in which SE recurs on the reduction or withdrawal of anesthesia.\" This condition is resistant to normal protocols used in the treatment of status epilepticus and exposes patients to increased risks of neuronal death, neuronal injury, and disruption of neuronal networks if not treated in a timely manner. It is mainly seen in patients with severe acute onset brain injury or presentation of new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE). The mortality, neurological deficits, and functional impairments are significant depending on the duration of status epilepticus and the resultant brain damage. Research is underway to find the cure for this devastating neurological condition. In this review, we will discuss the wide range of therapies used in the management of SRSE, provide suggestions regarding its treatment, and comment on future directions. The therapies evaluated include traditional and alternative anesthetic agents with antiepileptic agents. The other emerging therapies include hypothermia, steroids, immunosuppressive agents, electrical and magnetic stimulation therapies, emergent respective epilepsy surgery, the ketogenic diet, pyridoxine infusion, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and magnesium infusion. To date, there is a lack of robust published data regarding the safety and effectiveness of various therapies, and there continues to be a need for large randomized multicenter trials comparing newer therapies to treat this refractory condition.",

Medications may interfere with those enduring effects when added in combination and may prolong the life of the underlying episode when used alone.

      "abstract": "Individuals with intellectual disability (ID) are now living longer with the majority of individuals reaching middle and even “old age.” As a consequence of this extended longevity they are vulnerable to the same age‐associated health problems as elderly adults in the general population without ID. This includes dementia, a general term referring to a variety of diseases and conditions causing substantial loss of cognitive ability and functional declines; adults with Down syndrome are at especially high risk. A great deal of recent effort has focused on the very earliest detectable indicators of decline (and even prodromal stages of dementia‐causing diseases). A condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been conceptually defined as a decline in functioning that is more severe than expected with typical brain aging but not severe enough to meet criteria for a diagnosis of dementia. Consensus criteria for both dementia and MCI have been developed for typically developing adults but are of limited applicability for adults with ID, given their pre‐existing cognitive impairments. Early diagnosis will continue to be of growing importance, both to support symptomatic treatment and to prevent irreversible neuropathology when interventions are developed to slow or halt the progression of underlying disease. While the intellectual and developmental disabilities field has for some time recognized the need to develop best‐practices for the diagnosis of MCI and dementia, there remains a pressing need for empirically based assessment methods and classification criteria. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In adults over 65 years of age, cognitive impairment without dementia is two to five times more common than dementia and occurs in approximately 11–27% of the population. Most studies suggest that the prevalence of cognitive impairment increases with age. For example, Unverzagt and colleagues reported that 29% of individuals between 65 and 74 years of age and as many as 55% of individuals over age 84 exhibited symptoms of cognitive impairment (without dementia). However, there is considerable variability in prevalence estimates for MCI, in part because of different methods for ascertaining and defining MCI.",

The elderly are more often affected and there is a male preponderance. While transient RSBD can be seen after taking certain drugs or during drug withdrawal, the chronic type is usually idiopathic or associated with an underlying degenerative neurological condition. It can result in considerable distress and/or serious injury to the patients or their bed partners. Differential diagnoses include sleep-walking, night terrors, nightmares, nocturnal seizures, obstructive sleep apnoea, post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative states and nocturnal confusional states.

Nearly coincident with this reaction, they developed progressive cognitive deficits consistent with frontotemporal dementia. These patients illustrate emergent neuroleptic hypersensitivity as an early manifestation of other dementias. The predisposition to neuroleptic hypersensitivity could result from depleted nigral dopaminergic neurons suggested by “smudging” of the substantia nigra pars compacta on magnetic resonance imaging.",

A large number of anatomical, physiological, pharmacological and clinical data indicate that dopamine transmission plays an important role in frontal cortical functions. We review the main types of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and their response to treatment with levodopa.In studies involving the acute administration of levodopa, the results obtained with regard to the cognitive functions have been heterogeneous, since improvements, exacerbations and the absence of any changes have all been observed. This heterogeneity is affected by methodological problems deriving from the disease itself, the treatment administered and the way evaluation is carried out. Longitudinal studies show a pattern of initial improvement, followed by stability, or maintenance, over a period of 2 or 3 years and then renewed exacerbation with no response to levodopa. On occasions, patients may only respond after a certain period of continued treatment. Generally speaking, the more severe the cognitive impairment is, the poorer the response to levodopa will be.Therapy with levodopa modifies, in one sense or another, the cognitive disorders in Parkinson's disease, which indicates that the dopaminergic deficit unquestionably plays a role in these disorders. The absence of response in some patients or in some cognitive functions or the fact that it 'wears off' in most patients suggests that the dopaminergic deficit is only one of the factors in the aetiopathogenesis of the cognitive dysfunction found in Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

Mild head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13–15) has been shown to have considerable variability in outcome. Some persons experience rapid symptom resolution whereas others continue to evidence symptoms for an extended duration. A small, but clinically significant number of patients may be neuropsychologically and occupationally disabled at least up to 1 year postinjury. Methodological problems contfnue to plague milch head injury outcome studies. In contrast, moderate (Glasgow Coma Scale score 9–12) and severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score 3–8) result in more consistent patterns of disability following injury. In general, patients who sustain moderate to severe head injury tend to experience persistent and extensive neuropsychological, psychiatric, and occupational impairment. The impact of rehabilitative interventions is variable and dependent on injury severity, intervention type, and outcome criteria.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex disorder characterized by a broad spectrum of psychopathology. Aggressive efforts to bring the patient into remission should begin immediately after the first episode. Consequences of non-remission include poor prognosis, psychiatric and general medical complications, treatment resistance, and death from medical comorbidities and suicide. Prevention of relapse following remission is critical to the well-being and optimal functioning of patients with schizophrenia. The key to optimizing patients' outcomes is to ensure a patient's long-term continuation on medication. As treatment discontinuation can greatly impact the progression of the illness and the patient's ultimate outcome, selecting a treatment with maximum treatment effectiveness is optimal. Nonadherence to treatment is extremely prevalent among patients with schizophrenia, due to such factors as impaired cognition, lack of insight, and side effects associated with antipsychotic treatment. Atypical antipsychotics have shown some advantages over conventional antipsychotics in terms of reducing positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, preventing relapse, and incidence of tardive dyskinesia. Injectables and long-acting formulations of antipsychotics offer additional benefits in terms of ensuring treatment adherence.",

The appearance and sufferings of the patients during these attacks may further alarm relatives or onlookers, and even the medical man, unless he be familiar with the true nature of the seizures or fully alive to the history of the case, may be taken unawares, and feel so dubious about their purport and outcome as to be unable to give a reassuring prognosis. And yet the seizures which I have in mind are all consistent with long life and with good health at other times. Those with the more local effects may simulate or suggest organic disease of the brain ; those causing serious instability may also be wrongly attributed to cerebral vascular disease or cerebral tumour ; those which cause",

A strong clinical suspicion based on clinical history is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment and the strict adherence to the classical criteria of NMS may lead to a diagnostic delay and dire consequences for these patients and sometimes this delay can procure death.",

Rebound is the worsening of insomnia, anxiety or tension above pretreatment levels, particularly noticeable on discontinuation of short-acting benzodiazepines. Tapering the dose is advisable. Normal-dose dependence is characterized by a wide range of symptoms even after gradual discontinuation. Perceptual symptoms are characteristic. The syndrome is more severe in patients attempting to discontinue lorazepam than those stopping diazepam and more fail to discontinue. Alprazolam is also presenting especial difficulties and may not be fully cross-tolerant with other benzodiazepines. The management of withdrawal centres on the use of flexible withdrawal schedules together with unstinting psychological support. High-dose dependence and abuse are uncommon but increasing, particularly among polydrug abusers. The clinical and research implications of these studies are discussed.",

This definition has endured through time; however, the classification of the different types of pain is evolving. Original descriptions of pain were based on a temporal evolution, where the distinction between acute and chronic pain was that if it lasted for more than six months it was considered chronic. Another more conservative and innovative view proposed one month as the defining criterion. These early definitions did not account for the mechanisms involved in the development of the pain. The prevailing contemporary view is to classify pain according to the primary pathology involved in the cause of pain, namely: inflammatory (acute) or neuropathic (chronic). The latter can be considered a disease of the nervous system and not merely a symptom of some other condition. Furthermore, poorly treated acute pain can lead to neuropathic chronic pain. The current temporal cutoff value for chronic pain is three months.",

It can occur at any age but is more frequent with increasing age. Key clinical presentations include bulbar (slurred or difficult speech, problems swallowing, tongue fasciculation), limb (typically in one limb with weakness and muscle wasting), respiratory (breathlessness, chest muscle fasciculation) and cognitive features (behavioural change, emotional lability, features of frontotemporal dementia). Although survival is typically three to five years from symptom onset, there is significant individual variation. Rarely, survival may be 20 years or longer. Favourable features include a limb rather than a bulbar presentation, preserved weight and respiratory function, younger age of onset and longer time from fist symptom to diagnosis. The patient should be linked to a multidisciplinary team able to provide support from the start with a designated individual as the point of contact, with regular, coordinated assessments, as the patient's needs change and their condition progresses. Gastrostomy is an important supportive intervention which maximizes nutrition, and minimizes aspiration and chest infection. Adequate nutrition and hydration is key to maximizing health and survival. It is possible for a patient to control a computer and speech by eye. movement alone. An important consideration is voice banking where the patient may store their voice before there is difficulty with speech so that it can be used at a later stage if they need a communication aid. Impaired cough and retention of respiratory secretions is frequent in the later stages, and may be managed with physiotherapy. The patient should be referred for expert respiratory assessment if needed.",

Cognition is the sum total of mental processes that makes us acquire knowledge and keeps us aware of our surroundings and thus enables us to arrive at appropriate judgments. Cognitive deficits are recognized as enduring and persistent features in schizophrenia and can be neuro-cognitive or relating to social cognition. Neurocognitive deficits are deficits in speed of processing, attention / vigilance, working memory, verbal memory, visual memory, reasoning and problem solving, social cognition. Cognitive function can be assessed by various methods like experimental approach, neuropsychological and psychometric and ecologic approach. Cognitive deficits are present at onset of illness producing substantial impairment. Unlike psychotic symptoms, which remit with treatment, functional impairments remain stable over time. Detail understanding of such symptoms will help in disability limitation. Various cognitive remediation programmes are underway with such intent. Articles till March, 2012 were searched through PubMed and Google Scholar, which were studied in an attempt of understanding the topic. The information was structured and organized.",

Prevalence, corrected for spontaneous dyskinesia, averages 15%-20%; incidence is estimated at 2%-5% per year but appears to be highest between 6 and 24 months after initiation of neuroleptic treatment. No type of neuroleptic agent has proven more or less likely to be associated with tardive dyskinesia, nor is there a firm relationship between risk and mean dosage or total drug exposure. Factors contributing to individual vulnerability to tardive dyskinesia or spontaneous dyskinesia, other than advancing age, are not well-established. However, it is reasonable to assume that more rational and conservative clinical use of neuroleptic agents may reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia and other toxic effects. Many chronically psychotic patients can be maintained on doses only 10%-20% of those in common use. Spontaneous remission of tardive dyskinesia after treatment discontinuance is common, although it may not occur for many months. Safe and effective treatments of tardive dyskinesia, as well as new, nonneurotoxic antipsychotic agents, are required.",

Recently, numerous reports have described patients with prolonged muscle weakiiess ajer use of these agents for more than two days. Brief weakness lasting several hours to several days is likely the result of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, while more prolonged weakness lasting several weeks to months is likely caused by a myopathy. Specijic features of this myopathic disorder are reviewed. Clinically, patients have flaccid paralysis with intact sensation and cognition. Electrodiagnostic findings include decreased M-wave amplitudes, mild positive waves and jibrillations and small, polyphasic motor unit potentials. Muscle biopsyfindings include atrophy of type I and type II fibers, myojiber necrosis and selective loss of thick myofilaments. This myopathic disorder is felt to be related to the prolonged use of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents either alone or in combination with other medications or disorders. Many authors feel that the disorder is caused specifically by a combination of prolonged neuromuscular blockade and corticosteroids. Selective loss of thick myofilaments on muscle biopsy has been produced experimentally in rats by combining denervation with high doses of corticosteroids. As this disorder likely leads to additional respiratory compromise, dificulty weaning from the ventilator, and prolonged hospitalization, prevention is warranted. Methodr of prevention include minimizing the dosage of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and of other drugs with an effect on the neuromuscular junction, twitch monitoring with a peripheral nerve stimulator and allowing patients to come to an unparalyzed state for brief periods.",

This article will address the common causes, diagnosis and management of iatrogenic peripheral nerve injuries.\n\nThe most widely used classification of peripheral nerve injury is that described by Seddon in 1943.1 He divided nerve injuries into three types: neurapraxia, axonotmesis and neurotmesis.\n\nNeurapraxia (inactivity of the nerve) is a non-degenerative lesion of a nerve characterised by a complete or partial failure to propagate an action, potentially resulting in motor and/or sensory loss. It is usually caused by compression or ischaemia, resulting in ischaemia of the myelin sheath. The nerve remains intact and Wallerian degeneration does not occur. It is reversible if the injurious agent is removed. If the distal segment of the nerve is stimulated, there is a motor response. The lesion recovers by remyelination of the distal segment and takes between two and 12 weeks, depending on the age of the patient and the site of the injury.\n\nIn practice, it is unwise to assume that a lesion is a neurapraxia rather than a more severe injury because this will lead to delay in diagnosis and a poorer outcome. The presence of persistent pain suggests that the injurious agent is continuing to act. The diagnosis should not be made in the presence of a strong Tinel test which indicates that axons have been ruptured.\n\nAn axonotmesis (cutting of the axon) is the result of disruption of the axon and its myelin sheath. The supporting structures, Schwann cells, endoneurium, perineurium and epineurium remain intact. It is usually the result of severe compression or a crush injury. Wallerian degeneration occurs distally, and proximally to the closest node of Ranvier. Repair is by a combination of collateral sprouting in lesser injuries and axonal regeneration in more severe injuries. The latter occurs at …",

Both young and old alcoholics displayed significant impairments on tasks requiring the learning of novel associations and the holding of information in memory over longer delay intervals. The recovery of cognitive skills was found to depend on the length of abstinence and the particular behavioral functions examined. Whereas psychomotor skills and short-term memory improved significantly with prolonged abstinence, long-term memory was impaired even after seven years of continuous sobriety. We propose that recovery of short-term memory reflects reestablishment of cortical functioning, while the persistent long-term memory defect indicates more permanent damage to diencephalic structures.",

The meaning of the symptom is essential: it may reveal a crisis related to his developmental phase, antecedent infantile disease or the offset of adult disease. Secondly, at this age, the prescription of drugs rises questions about pharmacokinetics, possible side-effects, expected therapeutic effects and the way the prescription is experienced psychologically. Neuroleptics, which may be necessary in spite of their side-effects, should be restricted to psychotic conditions. Antidepressants, lithium, tranquilizers are also discussed with respect to their usefulness, risks and indications. But the meaning of any prescription is dependent upon the therapeutic relationship, and this is even more so for adolescents with whom careful listening is essential.",

NMS most often occurs shortly after the initiation, dose increase or withdrawal of the offending agent, but can rarely occur after long-term treatment at stable doses. Immediate discontinuation of the causative agent (or re-administration if the cause is the withdrawal of neuroleptic therapy) along with supportive therapy to maintain cardiorespiratory stability and to reduce fever are the cornerstone of the management of NMS. Additional 'specific' treatments include dantrolene, bromocriptine and amantadine, but their role in the management of NMS is controversial.This study reports the case of NMS associated with long-term treatment with olanzapine at a stable dose. Administration of dantrolene was well-tolerated and resulted in prompt resolution of NMS symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoid-dependent mechanisms of inflammation-mediated distant hippocampal damage are discussed with a focus on the consequences of traumatic brain injury. The effects of glucocorticoids on specific neuronal populations in the hippocampus depend on their concentration, duration of exposure and cell type. Previous stress and elevated level of glucocorticoids prior to pro-inflammatory impact, as well as long-term though moderate elevation of glucocorticoids, may inflate pro-inflammatory effects. Glucocorticoid-mediated long-lasting neuronal circuit changes in the hippocampus after brain trauma are involved in late post-traumatic pathology development, such as epilepsy, depression and cognitive impairment. Complex and diverse actions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis on neuroinflammation may be essential for late post-traumatic pathology. These mechanisms are applicable to remote hippocampal damage occurring after other types of focal brain damage (stroke, epilepsy) or central nervous system diseases without obvious focal injury. Thus, the liaisons of excessive glucocorticoids/dysfunctional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with neuroinflammation, dangerous to the hippocampus, may be crucial to distant hippocampal damage in many brain diseases. Taking into account that the hippocampus controls both the cognitive functions and the emotional state, further research on potential links between glucocorticoid signaling and inflammatory processes in the brain and respective mechanisms is vital.",

      "abstract": "From a phenomenological point of view, absence seizures refer to any type of epileptic event characterized by loss of awareness and responsiveness. However, a phenomenological definition of absence seizures is hampered by difficulties in conceptualizing consciousness and needs to take into account the electroclinical features and anatomical basis of seizures. Sensu stricto, absence seizures are defined as an electroclinical pattern of generalized 3/s spike-wave activity accompanied by loss of awareness and responsiveness. Although there is general belief that absences are most often encountered in childhood or early adolescence, a considerable number of patients suffer from absences late into adulthood, which are often refractory to antiepileptic drugs. These patients generally fall into one of two groups. The first group consists of those who have more or less typical absences in childhood or adolescence which continue into adulthood, and may be accompanied by other generalized seizures or neurological impairment. Few data are available addressing whether the seizure semiology of the absences in these patients changes over time or not. The second class of patients corresponds to those in whom absences emerge for the first time in adulthood or even in the senium. These need to be carefully distinguished from later aggravation or semiological transformation of undiagnosed childhood epilepsies and from certain complex focal seizures originating from the frontal or temporal lobe. A wide range of aetiologically and anatomically diverse processes may lead to the appearance of epileptic absences. It is important to note that absences also vary in their intensity, their impact on the ability of the subject to respond and react, and in particular in their natural history and their response to antiepileptic medication.",

      "abstract": "Clinically, patients with Delirium Tremens (DT) and acute alcohol hallucinosis (impending DT) appear excited with vivid false perception. Cerebral blood flow and eeg correspondingly point to hyperexcitability in the CNS during these conditions. Clinical trials with barbital treatment in alcohol withdrawal shows that the amount of drug and the drug plasma concentration is the same no matter whether the physical signs of withdrawal are accompanied by hallucinations and clouding of consciousness. The psychotic signs in DT and acute alcoholic hallucinosis develops after many years of alcoholism as does seizures. We hypothesize that physical withdrawal is determined by the degree of physical dependence developed during the most recent drinking period whereas the psychotic signs and seizures are due to a cumulated CNS hyperactivity developed over many years of repeated alcohol intoxication and withdrawal. Changes of electrolyte concentrations in plasma or CSF do not play an important role in the pathogenesis of DT and related clinical states except that changes in calcium and inorganic phosphate metabolism indirectly point to changes in membrane excitability. A new model for a study of rapidly repeated intoxication and withdrawal episodes in rats has shown that repetition of episodes augments the convulsive component of withdrawal whereas the non-convulsive signs are dependent on the most recent episode only. The augmentation of the convulsive component correlates with regional differences in brain glucose consumption. Furthermore, synaptic proteins and acidic phospholipids may be involved in the development of CNS hyperexcitability during alcohol withdrawal. In conclusion both clinical and experimental studies indicate that severe alcohol withdrawal reactions may consist of two components: 1) Physical withdrawal signs determined by recent physical dependence. 2) A long term cumulated CNS hyperexcitability relating to seizures and psychotic signs during withdrawal. This state is elicited by alcohol withdrawal but it represents a cumulated and permanent or long lasting CNS dysfunction in alcoholics. The precise biochemical/pathophysiological mechanisms for the development of the two-component dysfunction still remain to be clarified in detail.",

Although the effects of LLD make it important to achieve a diagnosis and start treatment quickly, individuals with LLD are often inadequately or unsuccessfully treated. The latest treatment developments suggest that interventions targeting executive dysfunction and neuroticism, constructs associated with poor response to antidepressants in older adults, are successful in treating LLD. Specific behavioral interventions (computerized cognitive training, mindfulness meditation, aerobic exercise) appear to decrease depressive symptoms and ameliorate executive dysfunction and neuroticism, but we do not fully understand the mechanisms by which these treatments work.

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment refers to frequent disorders in the elderly and senile, and their prevalence increases with age significantly. Non-dementia cognitive disorders mean a spectrum of changes in the cognitive sphere that precede the development of dementia over the course of many months and even years. Mild forms of cognitive impairment (MCI) are the most studied type of pre-dementia conditions, which in most cases represent a prodromal stage of disorders progressing over time to a dementia syndrome. Early identification of individuals with MCI is important because timely diagnosis of these disorders is expanding the potential impact of the secondary prevention and therapeutic intervention, which can delay or even prevent the onset of professional and social maladaptation due to development of dementia. The article considers the historical issues of studying these disorders, presents the modern principles of their classification and diagnostic criteria. A clinical observation of a patient with a polyfunctional non-amnestic type MCI syndrome is provided. The features of cognitive disorders typical for chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency, such as mental retardation, impaired activity arrangement, difficulties with generalisation in relative preservation of memory and orientation in combination with emotional and affective disorders are described. The authors discuss issues of treatment of MCI syndrome, which should be comprehensive and include the correction of all vascular risk factors, non-drug (regular physical activity, cognitive training) and pharmacological treatments aimed at improving cognitive performance. The article describes the possibilities of modern neuroprotective and symptomatic therapy of cognitive impairment, showing the role of choline alfoscerate in the treatment of MCI.",

This destructive lifetime pattern can be prevented in many if not most patients since antidepressant and other maintenance medications are being shown to be efficacious in preventing most future episodes of depression, maintaining euthymia, and preserving quality of life. On the basis of these and other still-developing findings (and with the recognition that maintenance strategies have been inadequately tested in depressed children and adolescents), reasonable clinical wisdom might suggest that lifetime pharmacologic maintenance may be indicated for patients 50 years or older at first episode, 40 years or older with two or more prior episodes, or for those with three or more prior episodes. \"Maintenance\" dosages need to be comparable to established \"treatment\" dosages until it is proven that lower doses are efficacious; such data now are lacking. When medication is selected for long-term treatment, strong considerations should be given to the agent's side effect profile, since compliance is essential for success.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Classification of neuroleptic drugs - lack of relationship to effect on negative symptoms in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Summary There is both pharmacological and clinical support for a classification of the schizophrenic syndrome into negative and positive subtypes. For neuroleptics that act upon both types of symptoms, it appears that lower doses are required for treatment of negative than for positive symptoms. Successful drug treatment of negative symptoms may therefore depend upon the choice of a correct dosage for the individual patient. Due to variation in pharamacokinetic parameters, similar doses of a neuroleptic drug may result in different plasma levels in individual patients, especially after oral medication. Pharmacokinetic variations, if not under proper control, may easily disguise a concentration-dependent relationship, such as the effects of a neuroleptic drug upon negative and positive symptoms. In drug treatment of negative symptoms it may therefore be an advantage to individualize the doses as a function of plasma drug level measurements, when available. No general relationship has been demonstrated between the chemical properties or pharmacodynamics of neuroleptic drugs and their potential to act upon negative symptoms. Also, the drugs which have been demonstrated to have an “energizing” effect have widely different pharmacokinetic properties. A chemical or pharmacological classification of neuroleptics therefore does not seem to give any information about their possible efficacy in treating negative symptoms in schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Difficulty falling asleep and/or maintaining sleep are common complaints in patients visiting medical clinics. Insomnia can occur alone or in combination with other medical or psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis and management of insomnia at times are perplexing. This updated study review aimed at a clinical algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in adults. We developed an easy-to-apply algorithm to diagnose and manage insomnia that can be used by general practitioners and non-sleep specialists. To this end, our team reviewed the previous studies to determine the prevalence, evaluation, and treatment of insomnia. We used the results to develop a clinical algorithm for diagnosing and managing insomnia. Insomnia occurs in a short (less than 3 months duration) or chronic form (≥3 months duration). Insomnia management includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. There is ample research evidence for the impact of a variety of non-pharmacological treatments, but both types of treatments can be used for each patient. If there are any contradictions in the diagnosis process, therapists should use objective instruments, such as polysomnography, but they should not be in a hurry to use these instruments.",

The magnitude of the deviations increases with clinical severity. Different disorders are characterized by distinctive profiles of abnormal values of brain electrical features. Computerized differential classification of some of these disorders can be achieved with high accuracy.

      "title": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome after abrupt discontinuation of neuroleptic and anticholinergic drugs",
      "abstract": "Extrapyramidal and autonomic symptoms changed degrees of consciousness, and aberrant laboratory results are the hallmarks of the relatively uncommon but severe neuroleptic adverse response known as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). The disease's dysautonomia symptoms and systemic consequences directly cause death. Mortality is now estimated to be between 10 and 20 percent, down from the early reports in the 1960s, which put it at 76 percent.[1,2] NMS has a 0.02–3% prevalence among patients treated with neuroleptic agents.[3] Withdrawal NMS is an even rarer condition. The pathophysiology of withdrawal-related NMS symptoms may be connected to cholinergic rebound, and withdrawal-related NMS may be a result of a dopaminergic system imbalance. A 55-year-old female patient with schizophrenia was taking risperidone 4 mg/day, trihexyphenidyl 2 mg/day, and lorazepam 2 mg/d for the last 2 years, regularly. Her medicine supply was over 3 days back and the patient missed her follow-up visit, resulting in the abrupt discontinuation of her medications. The patient initially complained of tremors in her limbs 2 days back, followed by fever, stiffness in her limbs, and slowness in movement, which developed over the next 2 days. The patient presented to the emergency department with altered sensorium and the above complaints. On examination, the patient was in altered sensorium and disoriented to time, place, and person, and mild pallor and icterus were present. On Glasgow coma scale patient had score of 10/15 (Eye - 4, Verbal - 4, Motor - 4), her blood pressure was 170/106 mm of Hg; pulse was 109/ minute; and body temperature was 101°F; her systemic examination revealed lead pipe rigidity of grade 4 on modified Ashworth scale and patient had brisk (+3) deep tendon reflexes on Bilateral knee and elbow. Laboratory investigation revealed hemoglobin of 9.9 gm/dl, serum sodium of 123.4 mmol/L, serum potassium of 4.03 mmol/L, serum chloride of 89.9 mmol/L, Creatine Phosphokinase - N Acetyl Cysteine of 2000 U/L, and 24-hour urine myoglobin of 87.07 ng/ml, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed no abnormality. With a diagnosis of NMS, she was started with amantadine 200 mg/day, bromocriptine 5 mg/day, and an injection of diazepam 30 mg/day along with supportive treatment for electrolyte imbalance. Based on clinical response, the decision was made to gradually increase bromocriptine to 7.5 mg/day, amantadine to 400 mg/day, and inj. diazepam to 40 mg/day over the next 2 days. The patient responded well and all the laboratory investigations on day 6 of admission came back normal, with rigidity of 1+ (on the modified Ashworth scale). The score on the modified Simpson Angus scale on day 6 was 22 (severe degree of movement disorder), which decreased during treatment. Bromocriptine and injection diazepam were gradually decreased to stop on discharge, and amantadine was decreased to 200 mg/day till discharge and gradually stopped during the next 4 weeks on subsequent follow-up visits, where we found the score on the modified Simpson Angus scale had dropped to 4. In our patient, the abrupt withdrawal of the anticholinergic medication concomitantly with the neuroleptic medication caused an impairment in the dopamine and acetylcholine balance, where the cholinergic tone overrides the dopaminergic tone. Previous case reports have postulated that dopaminergic imbalance rather than dopaminergic blockade might be the cause of NMS.[4] Most neuroleptic drugs possess central and peripheral antimuscarinic properties, so it is tempting to postulate that cholinergic rebound causes withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation.[5] Although the precise function of many drugs is still up for discussion, our example suggests that a dopamine agonist (such as bromocriptine, amantadine, levodopa, ropinirole, and apomorphine) may help treat NMS.

Symptom management, to alleviate, for example, nausea, constipation, convulsions, or pain, is paramount. Whereas the management of pain does not differ much from adults, it is expressed very differently by children, and may just present as a ‘too quiet a child’. Communication with a neurologically impaired child may be an everlasting struggle for relatives and caregivers. For this, setting up new communication systems may be very helpful. Other issues in neurologic palliative care for children are intellectual deterioration, swallowing impairment, and withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment.",

      "title": "Addiction is a Reward Deficit and Stress Surfeit Disorder",
      "abstract": "Drug addiction can be defined by a three-stage cycle—binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation—that involves allostatic changes in the brain reward and stress systems. Two primary sources of reinforcement, positive and negative reinforcement, have been hypothesized to play a role in this allostatic process. The negative emotional state that drives negative reinforcement is hypothesized to derive from dysregulation of key neurochemical elements involved in the brain reward and stress systems. Specific neurochemical elements in these structures include not only decreases in reward system function (within-system opponent processes) but also recruitment of the brain stress systems mediated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and dynorphin-κ opioid systems in the ventral striatum, extended amygdala, and frontal cortex (both between-system opponent processes). CRF antagonists block anxiety-like responses associated with withdrawal, block increases in reward thresholds produced by withdrawal from drugs of abuse, and block compulsive-like drug taking during extended access. Excessive drug taking also engages the activation of CRF in the medial prefrontal cortex, paralleled by deficits in executive function that may facilitate the transition to compulsive-like responding. Neuropeptide Y, a powerful anti-stress neurotransmitter, has a profile of action on compulsive-like responding for ethanol similar to a CRF1 antagonist. Blockade of the κ opioid system can also block dysphoric-like effects associated with withdrawal from drugs of abuse and block the development of compulsive-like responding during extended access to drugs of abuse, suggesting another powerful brain stress system that contributes to compulsive drug seeking. The loss of reward function and recruitment of brain systems provide a powerful neurochemical basis that drives the compulsivity of addiction.",

This chapter begins by discussing normative age-related changes in cognition followed by a short discussion of memory impairments, dementia, and aging. The incidence of visual impairments such as cataracts and macular degeneration increases with age. Age is the greatest risk factor for pathological neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to changes in memory or other cognitive domains that are reported by the patient or collateral informant, and it is confirmed by neuropsychological testing. The performance of psychiatrically healthy adults aged 70 years and older was superior to the performance of the youngest patients with schizophrenia on measures of working and episodic memory, executive function, and psychomotor speed.",

The chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathies are less severe, and less distinctive. Their recognition depends on eliciting a history of earlier classical manifestations of Lyme disease and by laboratory testing. In both acute and chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathy, electrophysiologic testing often proves the presence of a sensorimotor, axon loss polyradiculoneuropathy. Both acute and chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathy have similar pathologic features and can be classified as a nonvasculitic mononeuritis multiplex. The pathogenesis is uncertain; both direct infection as well as parainfectious mechanisms may play a role. The treatment with which we have the most experience is intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g/day for 2 to 4 weeks. Improvement occurs rapidly over days to weeks in early Lyme neuroborreliosis, but slowly over many months in chronic neuroborreliosis.",

The panel agreed that • Prevalence of co-morbid depression in India is not well-documented except for few regional studies. • It is frequently witnessed but is hardly recognized or managed as a concurrent disease. • There is a need to differentiate between depressive 'feeling\" and 'disease\". • The clinicians should increase duration of history-taking to include questions like, 'Do you feel sad/low? Are you disinterested?\" in suspected cases. • There is a need for developing Indian consensus to identify co-morbid depression, to decide when to start an antidepressant drug, in what dosage and duration with special focus on the when to refer to a psychiatrist.

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many of those who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms which are seen in all anxiety disorders, and diagnosis rests on the identification of the particular anxiety disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or undergoing individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, and for this reason it is helpful to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence-base for each anxiety disorder.",

      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) can be precipitated by many modern chemotherapeutic agents.CIPN affects the patient's quality of life not only physically, but also functionally, psychosocially, spiritually and affects the family as well.If severe acute syndrome develops during chemotherapy, doses of drugs should be reduced or even stopped.CIPN is a neurological side effect occurring during chemotherapy treatment in cancer patient depending on many factors such as age, dose strength, complete total drug dose received, period of therapy, use of more than two groups of neurotoxic agents, concomitant neuropathies (for example, diabetic neuropathy), genetic vulnerability, and alcoholism.Pathophysiology of CIPN is not clearly understood.The pathological processes by which chemotherapy drugs harm the nervous system structures cause CIPN.It depends on several factors or causes which include microtubule disruption, oxidative stress and mitochondrial break, changes in ion channel activity, myelin sheath and DNA damage, and neuro inflammation.Clinical manifestations vary from patient to patient.It is classified into three types such as sensory, motor and autonomic.Presently there are no standard guidelines for the assessment of CIPN.It is considered both objective evidence of neurological dysfunction and assessment of symptoms reported by the patient.Nurses can play a very important role in the early identification of CIPN in cancer patients which can help to plan and in modification of treatment.This will help patients to enjoy a better quality of life.This review aims to give an update regarding CIPN and nursing aspect.",

      "title": "NEW ADVANCES IN TREATMENT OF CEREBRAL PALSY",
      "abstract": "Objectives: Cerebral palsy is an umbrella term covering a group of non-progressive, but often changing, motor impairment syndromes secondary to lesions or anomalies of the brain arising in the early stages of its development (DM & CN, 1992, 34: 547–55). Cerebral palsy is the most frequent motor impairment in childhood, but, it is more than merely a motor disorder. There can be also problems of development, perceptual- cognitive impairment, social and functional problems of daily living, emotional and behavioural problems, Epilepsy, and many other difficulties. There are an estimated 15 million people with cerebral palsy around the world and more then half of them are mentally retarded and one third have epilepsy How to treat it? Having in mind a broad spectrum of differences in age of persons at which firm diagnosis is made, inclusions and exclusions criteria, denominator for clinical features (topographical or other classification), and especially what was a cause and timing of insult, size and location of lesion, maturational state of system injured, integrity of areas surrounding and contralateral to lesion, genetic and environmental background, gene-gene and geneenvironment interactions, and intervening conditions (timing of start, quality, duration and intensity), it is obvious that there are currently no evidence-based strategies for preventing cerebral palsy and to say which method of treatment is superior. In addition to this fact we should find a balance between physiotherapy (among them nowadays the most used Neurodevelopmental treatment – Bobath, Vojta, Conductive education and Constrain induced therapy), pharmacology, and neurosurgical approaches (Local anaesthetics, Local neurolytics -Alcohol, Phenol-, Botulinum toxin, Baclofen pump, Selective dorsal rhizotomy, Peripheral neurectomy, Deep brain stimulation). Beside this there are many not proven therapies (Biofeedback, Functional Motor Learning, Acupuncture, The “Adeli” suit, Hyperbaric oxygenation, Homeopathy, Bio-energy, and others). Gene and transplantation therapies? Even for genetic causes of early brain lesions (e.g. as is thrombophilias) are only a very small proportion of potential candidate genes have been examined to date, how can we expect that in the near future we will have a gene therapy. Stem cells – to repopulate brain? Indeed, there is now ample evidence that stem cells exist in the central nervous system throughout life, and the progeny of these stem cells may have the ability to assume the functional role of neural cells that have been lost. In addition, once transplanted, stem cells have been shown to survive, migrate, and differentiate. But nevertheless, the clinical utility of stem cell therapy for neurorestoration remains elusive.",

      "title": "[Perioperative disorders of mental functions].",
      "abstract": "Mental disorders are characterized by disturbances of thought, perception, affect and behavior, which occur as a result of brain damage. Recognizing and treating these conditions is necessary not only for psychiatrists but for all physicians. Disorder of mental function is one of the most common associated conditions in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, disturbances of mental function often remain unrecognized. In ICU patients, different types of mental function disorders may develop. They range from sleep disorders, severe depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cognitive disorders including delirium. The causes of mental dysfunction in ICU patients can be divided into environmental and medical. Cognitive disorders are related to mental processes such as learning ability, memory, perception and problem solving. Cognitive disorders are usually not prominent in the early postoperative period and in many cases are discovered after hospital discharge because of difficulties in performing everyday activities at home or at work. The etiology of postoperative cognitive impairment is unclear. Older age, previous presence of cognitive dysfunction, severity of disease, and polypharmacy with more than four drugs are some of the risk factors identified. Delirium is a multifactorial disorder. It is an acute confusional state characterized by alteration of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. It is considered as the most common form of mental distress in ICU patients. Nearly 30% of all hospitalized patients pass through deliriant phase during their hospital stay. Delirium can last for several days to several weeks. Almost always it ends with complete withdrawal of psychopathological symptoms. Sometimes it can evolve into a chronic brain syndrome (dementia). The causes are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease the symptoms. Delirious patient is at risk of complications of immobility and confusion, leading to a high prevalence of irreversible functional decline. An interdisciplinary approach to delirium should also include family or other caregivers. In the diagnosis of delirium, several tests are used to complement clinical assessment. Among the most commonly used are the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test. Depression is a common disorder among patients treated at ICU and occurs due to the impact of the disease on the body and the quality of life, independence, employment and other aspects of life. Depression can interfere with the speed of recovery, affects the postoperative quality of life, and in a certain number of patients may lead to suicidal thoughts and intentions. Phobias and generalized anxiety are the most common anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by strong, excessive anxiety and worry about everyday life events. PTSD is delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation, extremely threatening or catastrophic nature, which is outside the common experience of people and would hit or traumatize almost all people. Treatment of delirium and other disorders is causal. The causes of psychosis are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease symptoms. The primary objective of prevention is appropriate therapy and correction of potential imbalances possibly underlying disturbances, stabilization of vital functions as well as early return to daily activities. Doctors and other medical staff must be aware of the importance and consequences of behavioral and emotional disorders in critically ill patients. Additional research is needed to discover the ways to prevent and/ or reduce the frequency and severity of the consequences and treatment of cognitive and emotional disorders.",

Comatose patients normally maintain their eyes closed without evidence of opening spontaneously or to external stimuli, do not follow instructions, do not show goal-directed or voluntary conduct, do not speak and cannot sustain looking or tracking movements of more than a 45˚ angle. Excluded are secondary neurobehavioral signs and symptoms in coma that have been treated pharmacologically with sedatives. The definition of coma in terms of cerebral functioning refers to a state of acute brain failure not strictly related to any particular cerebral substratum or specific anatomical level of lesion. Coma normally occurs when broad areas in the upper and lower brain stems, or cerebral hemispheres, or simultaneously in the cerebral hemispheres and brain stem are damaged. The most frequent causes of coma are diffuse axonal pathology, hypoxia and secondary lesions which affect the brainstem (Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4).",

Examination limitations, complex comorbidities, and technical difficulties associated with electrodiagnostic testing in an ICU setting also create unique challenges during evaluation of patients with possible neuromuscular disorders. Respiratory failure may occur as an initial sign of an underlying neuromuscular disorder, as a chronic respiratory insufficiency, or as an inability to wean the patient from mechanical ventilation. Respiratory function is often closely related to dysphagia, which may also lead to aspiration and sudden worsening of respiratory function. In addition to weakness, progressive cardiomyopathy associated with myopathies can precipitate cardiac failure and arrhythmias and even necessitate heart transplantation.

These conditions may have some similar manifestations, making differential diagnosis difficult. Depressed alcoholics report more previous treatment for substance abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and marital problems than those without depression. They also incur greater loneliness, unemployment, and social ineptness. Depressive symptoms found commonly in this group include work inhibition, guilt, self-disgust, dissatisfaction, and social disinterest. A history of depression among relatives favors a dual diagnosis of alcoholism and depression. Distinguishing those alcoholics with specific depressive illness enhances the therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol abusers need treatment, but those with concomitant depression persisting well beyond detoxification often require antidepressant medications. In long-term care, lithium may reduce alcohol-related rehospitalizations. A strong doctor-patient relationship with or without pharmacotherapy promotes continuation in a therapeutic regimen. Involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous and disulfiram maintenance therapy are other deterrents to drinking relapse.",

      "title": "Improving the management of neuropathic pain.",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is defined as 'pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system'. It may reflect a widespread neuropathic process (e.g. diabetic neuropathy) or a more focal disorder (e.g. post-herpetic neuralgia). The practical importance of recognising neuropathic pain (as distinct from nociceptive pain) lies in the difference in effective treatments. The patient may be experiencing more than one type of pain. Many long-term disabling neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, as well as causing neuropathic pain, may also give rise to musculoskeletal pains which may be more readily amenable to treatment. Most treatment for long-term pain, including neuropathic pain, should be provided in primary care, with specialist support. When taking the history it is important to elicit information about the site, duration, intensity and character of the pain, or pains, and what precipitates and relieves it. Accompanying somatosensory disturbance in the painful territory (numbness; allodynia; hyperalgesia; paraesthesia and dysaesthesia) is strongly suggestive of neuropathic pain. A specialist opinion should be sought where the diagnosis is uncertain, or the patient's condition is rapidly deteriorating or uncontrolled. This may be a specialist in a particular condition, to address issues of primary diagnosis, or a specialist in pain medicine to advise on, or provide, further treatment. Patients who are struggling with their pain are best served by specialist centres that can endeavour to explain the condition and encourage self-management.",

The effects of a large number of drugs on motor evoked potentials (MEPs) have been documented and these are included here but a discussion of anaesthetic and paralysing agents is included in Chapter 18.In this rare syndrome, attacks of transient unilateral weakness occur beginning in the first year oflife. Attacks may occur on either side at different times, may last minutes to hours and may occur up to several times per week. A slowly progressive neurological deficit may develop comprising intellectual impairment, dysarthria and dystonia. The cause of the condition is unknown, but the similarity with familial hemiplegic migraine is striking. Another possibility is mitochondrial cytopathy. The origin of the progressive deteriora tion has been suggested to be due to accumulated microvascular lesions, but there is no evidence for this on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance spectro scopy. A 23-year-old patient with this condition has been investigated between attacks and during an attack ofleft hemiplegia (Nezu et al. 1997b). Interestingly, the patient had also developed episodic ataxia (see Chapter 13) which occurred independently of the hemiplegia. Between attacks, central motor conduction time (CMCT) to the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle was normal (right, 7.8 m; left, 7.3 ms). During the attack, CMCT to the left FDI was prolonged at 10.9 ms. Corticomotor threshold and peripheral nerve conduction were unchanged during the attack. Because of the transient nature of attacks, slowing of central conduction cannot be due to demyelination. The normal corticomotor threshold argues against a large shift in cortical or spinal excitability. The most likely explanation is an alteration in temporal summation at the spinal motoneuron.",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal enuresis (NE) is a very common clinical disorder. According to DSM-IV, NE is defined as repeated voiding, accidental or on purpose, into clothing or into the bed, at least twice a week, for 3 consecutive months, in children older than 5 years, age in which the sfincterial control is acquired. The pathophysiology of NE is not fully understood. It has been suggested that NE is the result of a combination of osmoregulatory or urodynamic disturbances, disorders of arousal and genetic factors. The evaluation of a child with minctional disorders begins with a good history and a physical examination. Then laboratory analysis and instrumental investigations can be used. There are pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for NE. The role of drugs is a short-term possibility that allows the child to recover confidence, or a temporary measure to tide him/her over nights spent away from home. For too long, NE has not been recognised as a severe condition, because there was no specific education at medical school and a poor involvement by the practitioners.

This review highlights neuropsychiatric and cognitive observations that have direct relevance to patient care and outcome.Delirium is a common event, especially the hypoactive forms in the elderly. The recognition of significant cognitive dysfunction is worrying since it has profound implications for how we treat and manage patients within intensive care and beyond. The most important message is that the 'awake' intensive care unit patient is not necessarily free of significant brain dysfunction. There is also the added complication of psychological disturbances related to real or imagined delusional experiences underlying the importance of memory and recall. Longer-term implications, particularly debilitating conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder, mean that there is a need for improved post-intensive care unit rehabilitation care.Health professionals working with the critically ill must routinely include the assessment of brain cognitive function. While some of the consequences may be unavoidable, we need to reassess our sedation and care practices to ensure we are not confounding the problem. Practical options to improve outcome are being developed and emphasise that the recovery from critical illness is psychological as well as physical.",

      "title": "Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: What We Know Now",
      "abstract": "Small delays in onset of Alzheimer's Disease are predicted to reduce its global burden, but we need to better understand factors that increase the risk-and methods to reduce it. The clinical syndrome of dementia refers to a pattern of cognitive deficits characterized by impairment in memory and at least one other cognitive domain (e.g., language, executive functions, visuospatial abilities) that is sufficiently severe to impact behavior and interfere with social or occupational functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Dementia may be progressive, static, or remitting, and its onset and course of symptoms are a function of underlying neuropathology from various causes. For example, dementia because of a neurodegenerative process tends to involve an insidious onset with gradual progressive cognitive impairment. In contrast, dementia from vascular or acquired brain injury tends to involve an abrupt onset of clinical symptoms that may remain static or show stepwise cognitive decline that corresponds to episodes of cerebrovascular accidents. The most common causes of dementia are neuropathologically distinguished on the basis of the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease); multiple or strategically placed infarctions, ischemic injury, or hemorrhagic lesions (e.g., vascular dementia); cell loss and the deposition of Lewy bodies in sub-cortical, limbic, and neocortical regions (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies); and prominent frontal and temporal lobar atrophy (frontotemporal dementia). Dementia can also be found in the context of other neurological, infectious, or metabolic conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, human immunodeficiency virus, or traumatic brain injury. Despite recent advances in amyloid imaging and cerebral spinal fluid analysis, neuropathological changes are often only accurately assessed at autopsy. This makes definitive diagnosis during an individual's lifetime difficult. Effectively differentiating between forms of dementia or normal aging requires reliance on the neuropsychological definition of a specific pattern of cognitive deficits. Epidemiology and Neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's Disease is the leading cause of dementia in elders and accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of all dementia cases. An estimated 5.3 million Americans have Alzheimer's Disease. Reports indicate the disease is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and deaths because of Alzheimer's Disease are on the rise, with an increase of 46 percent between 2000 and 2006. Given the advancing age of the baby boom generation, by 2050, 14 million older Americans and 81 million adults worldwide are expected to have the disease (Alzheimer's Association, 2010a). Alzheimer's Disease is an age-related degenerative brain disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular fibrillar amyloid deposits and intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These characteristics lead to neuronal atrophy and synapse loss in medial temporal lobe limbic structures that are critical for episodic memory and extend to the association cortices of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes with disease progression (Braak and Braak, 1991). Consistent with these widespread neuropathological changes, the primary clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive global dementia syndrome that usually begins in later life. It is generally agreed that the pathological cascade of brain changes occurs gradually in Alzheimer's Disease, beginning with the very early accrual of Aβ plaques in the brain, and is followed by a variable lag time after which neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the leading pathological process (Jack et al., 2010). Although Aβ neuropathology is thought to be causal, clinical symptoms are more closely related to neurofibrillary tangles than amyloid deposition. …",

      "title": "The biological basis of injury and neuroprotection in the fetal and neonatal brain",
      "abstract": "Abstract A compromised intrauterine environment that delivers low levels of oxygen and/or nutrients, or is infected or inflammatory, can result in fetal brain injury, abnormal brain development and in cases of chronic compromise, intrauterine growth restriction. Preterm birth can also be associated with injury to the developing brain and affect the normal trajectory of brain growth. This review will focus on the effects that episodes of perinatal hypoxia (acute, chronic, associated with inflammation or as an antecedent of preterm birth) can have on the developing brain. In animal models of these conditions we have found that relatively brief (acute) periods of fetal hypoxemia can have significant effects on the fetal brain, for example death of susceptible neuronal populations (cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex) and cerebral white matter damage. Chronic placental insufficiency which includes fetal hypoxemia, nutrient restriction and altered endocrine status can result in fetal growth restriction and long‐term deficits in neural connectivity in addition to altered postnatal function, for example in the auditory and visual systems. Maternal/fetal inflammation can result in fetal brain damage, particularly but not exclusively in the white matter; injury is more pronounced when associated with fetal hypoxemia. In the baboon, in which the normal trajectory of growth is affected by preterm birth, there is a direct correlation between a higher flux in oxygen saturation and a greater extent of neuropathological damage. Currently, the only established therapy for neonatal encephalopathy in full term neonates is moderate hypothermia although this only offers some protection to moderately but not severely affected brains. There is no accepted therapy for injured preterm brains. Consequently the search for more efficacious treatments continues; we discuss neuroprotective agents (erythropoietin, N‐acetyl cysteine, melatonin, creatine, neurosteroids) which we have trialed in appropriate animal models. The possibility of combining hypothermia with such agents or growth factors is now being considered. A deeper understanding of causal pathways in brain injury is essential for the development of efficacious strategies for neuroprotection.",

      "abstract": "Objectives \"Epileptic dementia\" is reported in adults with childhood-onset refractory epilepsy. Cognitive deterioration can also occur in a \"second-hit model\". Materials and methods We studied the clinical and neuropsychological characteristics of patients with cognitive deterioration (≥1 SD discrepancy between current IQ and premorbid IQ). Memory function, reaction time and processing speed were also evaluated. Analyses were performed to investigate which clinical characteristics correlated with cognitive deterioration. Results Twenty-seven patients were included with a mean age of 55.7 years old, an average age at epilepsy onset of 33.9 years and a mean duration of 21.8 years. Over 40% had experienced at least one status epilepticus. About 77.8% had at least one comorbid disease (most of (cardio)vascular origin). Cognitive deterioration scores were significant for both Performance IQ and Full Scale IQ, but not for Verbal IQ. Impairments in fluid functions primarily affected the IQ-scores. Memory was not impaired. Epilepsy factors explained 7% of the variance in deterioration, whereas 38% was explained by relatively low premorbid IQ and educational level, high age at seizure onset and older age. Conclusions A subgroup of patients with localization-related epilepsy exhibits cognitive decline characterized by deterioration in PIQ and FSIQ, but with preserved higher order functions (VIQ and memory). Patients typically have epilepsia tarda, comorbid pathology, relatively low educational level and older age. These are factors known to increase the vulnerability of the brain by diminishing cognitive reserve. Cognitive deterioration may develop according to a stepwise \"second-hit model\", affecting and accelerating the cognitive ageing process.",

      "abstract": "• Little is known of factors that, on an individual basis, confer vulnerability to the emergence of involuntary movements (tardive dyskinesia) during long-term neuroleptic treatment. In this study of 88 chronic schizophrenic inpatients, 22 variables (four demographic, 14 medication history, and four features of illness) were compared for any association(s) with the presence, by differing topographies and criteria of abnormality, and severity of involuntary movements. Irrespective of the criterion used, the presence of marked cognitive dysfunction—muteness bore a consistent and highly significant primary association with both the presence and the overall severity of orofacial dyskinesia; no such association was found in relation to the presence of limb-truncal dyskinesia. Flattening of affect was the only other variable consistently associated with the presence of orofacial movements. The reliability and prominence of the association between the presence of orofacial, but not of limb-truncal, movements and cognitive dysfunction—negative symptoms suggest that these varying topographies may not constitute a unitary syndrome. This strong association, not with indexes of neuroleptic exposure but rather with features of the illness for which that treatment was prescribed, suggests some neurologic process, more subtle than may previously have been appreciated, as a vulnerability factor of some importance. In schizophrenia it appears to be intimately related to the disease process.",

      "title": "Sustained Cognitive Improvement in Alzheimer’s Disease Patients Following a Precision Medicine Protocol: Case Series",
      "abstract": "Arguably, the most important parameter in treating cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease is the length of time in which improvement, if achieved at all, is sustained. However, monotherapies such as donepezil and memantine are associated with a more rapid decline than no treatment in patients over multi-year follow-ups. Furthermore, anti-amyloid antibody treatment, which at best simply slows decline, is associated with accelerated cerebral atrophy, resulting in earlier dementia-associated brain volumes for those treated at the MCI stage than untreated patients. In contrast, a precision medicine approach, in which the multiple potential drivers of cognitive decline are identified for each patient and then targeted with a personalized protocol (such as ReCODE), has led to documented improvements in patients with cognitive decline, but long-term follow-up (>5 years) has not been reported previously. Therefore, here, we report sustained cognitive improvement, in some cases for over a decade, in patients treated with a precision medicine protocol-something that has not been reported in patients treated with anti-cholinesterase, glutamate receptor inhibitory, anti-amyloid, or other therapeutic methods. These case studies warrant long-term cohort studies to determine how frequently such sustained cognitive improvements occur in patients treated with precision medicine protocols.",

Pharmacotherapy may have a substantial impact on the course and outcome of OCD. Method: We review the evidence supporting available strategies for the pharmacological treatment of OCD. Results: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remain the pharmacological treatment of choice and are associated with improved health-related quality of life. Discontinuation is associated with relapse and loss of quality of life, implying treatment should continue long-term. A substantial minority of patients who fail to respond to SSRI may benefit from dose elevation or adjunctive antipsychotics, though long-term trials validating the effectiveness and tolerability of these strategies are relatively lacking. Conclusion: The pharmacological evidence-base for the treatment of OCD is becoming increasingly robust. Treatment with SSRIs and clomipramine remains uncontroversial and improvements are sustained over time. Newer compounds targeting serotonin receptor subtypes and other neurotransmitter systems are undergoing evaluation.",

Case description An elderly aged 64 years, with well-controlled hypertension and diabetes and no history of memory complaints, developed cognitive decline of rapid onset (three months). She was evaluated in a private practice and treated with an anticholinesterase inhibitor, without having been performed a cognitive screening and evaluation by neuroimaging. During comprehensive geriatric assessment we found significant impairment of attention and concentration, and verbal and motor perserveration. We suspected of frontal-subcortical impairment, associated with rapid cognitive decline, suggesting a frontal/fronto parietal traumatic or neoplastic injury. Neuroimaging and subsequent biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. Conclusions: Cognitive impairment of rapid onset and abnormal responses of specific functions can corroborate or increase the level of suspicion for unusual etiologies of dementia. Proper screening or neuropsychological testing, as part of a comprehensive geriatric assessment, can increase the likelihood and accuracy in identifying differential diagnoses.",

Diagnostic procedure for insomnia should include evaluation of sleep–wake behaviour and sleep history, as well as questions about somatic and mental disorders, anamnesis of medication and other substances used, physical examination, sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, and additional measures. Sleep diaries or actigraphy can be used to evaluate sleep–wake schedules or circadian rhythm disorders. Polysomnography is recommended when other sleep disorders (periodic limb movement disorder, sleep apnea or narcolepsy) are suspected, also for treatment-resistant insomnia. Cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age. A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy is not effective or not available. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia. Long-term treatment of insomnia with benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists is not recommended. Sedating antidepressants are effective for short-term insomnia treatment. Antihistaminics and antipsychotics are not recommended for insomnia treatment because of insufficient evidence. Melatonin is not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of low efficacy. Phytotherapeutics are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence. Light therapy and exercise regimes may be useful as adjunct therapies. Acupuncture, aromatherapy, foot reflexology, homeopathy, meditative movement, moxibustion, and yoga are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence.",

      "title": "Tocotrienol and Cognitive Dysfunction Induced by Alcohol",
      "abstract": "Alcoholism, the chronic and excessive consumption of alcohol, is a syndrome characterized by severe peripheral as well as central nervous system toxicity. However, the neurobehavioral deficits induced by alcohol and their impact on quality of life of an individual, are often unrecognized. Over 17 million Americans, that is, 8.5 % of the population, meet the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse, more commonly referred to as chronic alcoholism [1]. Up to 50–75 % of long-term alcoholics may show permanent cognitive impairment, making chronic alcoholism the second leading cause of dementia behind Alzheimer's disease [2]. A significant number of alcoholics have clinically relevant cognitive deficits, even when the most severe alcohol-related dementias are excluded [3] (e.g., Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome or hepatic encephalopathy). Alcoholics consistently show deficits in executive function, declarative memory, and short-term memory and frequently show impairments in spatial learning and memory and impulsivity, effects which indicate hippocampal dysfunction [3, 4]. Parallel to the behavioral and cognitive impairments are observations of \"brain shrinkage\" or neurodegeneration in alcoholics [5, 6]. Human imaging studies, animal models, and postmortem analysis of brain structure support that chronic alcoholism is closely associated with brain damage or neurodegeneration. Alcoholics show significant volume loss in cortical and subcortical brain structures that includes both gray and white matter shrinkage. These widespread deficits occur in the absence of major nutritional deficiencies, although nutritional deficiencies can cause neurodegeneration and could contribute to alcoholic degeneration. Both postmortem and in vivo imaging studies of brain morphology reveal abnormally reduced brain volumes of gray and white matter across multiple regions. The frontal lobes are the most insulted region in the alcoholic brain with the superior frontal cortex showing significant neuronal loss [6, 7]. The frontal lobes regulate complex cognitive skills such as working memory, temporal ordering, discrimination, and reversal learning that underlie judgment, attention, risk taking, and motivation. Disorders in these behaviors are central if not causal to the consumption of dangerous amounts of alcohol despite the knowledge of negative consequences. Accordingly, chronic alcoholics demonstrate impaired judgment, blunted affect, poor insight, social withdrawal, reduced motivation, distractibility, attention, and impulse-control deficits [3, 4, 6]. Both clinical observations [3, 4] and animal studies have shown a direct relationship between chronic alcohol and learning and memory deficits [8–11].",

It involves a fluctuating cognitive impairment with reduced alertness and often with poorly formed delusions and/or visual hallucinations. The main differential diagnosis is from dementia, although delirium is more likely to develop in patients with existing dementia. Almost any medical condition that affects brain function may cause delirium. Infection is the most common cause, and it is important to consider prescribed drugs as a cause and to remember drug and alcohol withdrawal. Imperatives in management are first to keep the patient safe from harm (they may wander or put themselves in danger), and second to find and correct the cause. Urgent medical investigation and treatment is required as long periods of delirium put the patient at risk of harm, including permanent cognitive impairment.",

Those with eating disorders may misuse medication and substances to manage their weight (e.g. laxatives, diuretics, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder stimulants, slimming pills, semaglutide and caffeine). Other psychiatric conditions (particularly anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder) often coexist with eating disorders, and this may in part explain the benefit sometimes seen with medication.

Ces alterations peuvent trouver leurs origines dans des atteintes primaires de la fonction neuromusculaire et/ou des atteintes secondaires causees par exemple, par une diminution de l'activite spontanee favorisee par une pathologie chronique. Ainsi, la faiblesse et la fatigabilite musculaire sont des symptomes tres frequemment rapportes dans les maladies neuromusculaires (myopathies/neuropathies d'origine genetique ou acquise), les pathologies impliquant le systeme cardiovasculaire (insuffisance cardiaque) et/ou respiratoire (broncho-pneumopathie chronique obstructive (BPCO)). Ces symptomes sont aussi frequemment associes aux syndromes idiopathiques de douleurs chroniques accompagnees d'anomalies de la nociception (syndrome fibromyalgique). Le developpement d'outils d'evaluation bien toleres et fiables de la force, de l'endurance et de la fatigue neuromusculaire est d'une importance cruciale pour approfondir la comprehension des mecanismes physiopathologiques et pour disposer de criteres de jugement de qualite dans le cadre d'etudes observationnelles et interventionnelles. Dans ce contexte, la stimulation artificielle electrique s'est revelee etre un outil performant pour evaluer in situ la fonction musculaire chez l'humain au repos et au cours de l'exercice. Plus specifiquement, la stimulation magnetique des troncs nerveux peripheriques a montre des predispositions interessantes pour l'evaluation de la fonction des muscles locomoteurs et respiratoires dans le cadre clinique. Au cours de ce travail, nous avons developpe des outils d'evaluation de la force, de l'endurance et de la fatigue neuromusculaire en utilisant la neurostimulation magnetique et des protocoles d'exercice potentiellement applicables chez le patient. Nous avons etudie leurs capacites a detecter des differences liees au sexe, l'âge et au statut d'entrainement. Dans un second temps, nous avons applique nos evaluations dans le cadre de maladies neuromusculaires et de syndromes douloureux chroniques. Chez le patient BPCO, nous avons etudie les phenomenes de fatigue des muscles respiratoires et locomoteurs, leur impact sur la reponse a l'effort ainsi que leurs relations entre eux et avec les symptomes percus.

      "abstract": "Objective To determine the relations between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and several neurologic outcomes 6 months or more after TBI. Participants Not applicable. Design Systematic review of the published, peer-reviewed literature. Primary Measures Not applicable. Results We identified 75 studies that examined the relations between TBI and neurologic outcomes. Unprovoked seizures are causally related to penetrating TBI as well as to moderate and severe TBI. There was only limited evidence of an association between seizures and mild TBI. Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) was associated with moderate and severe TBI, but not with mild TBI unless there was loss of consciousness (LOC); the evidence for the latter was limited. Parkinsonism was associated with moderate and severe TBI, but there was only modest evidence of a link with mild TBI without LOC. Dementia pugilistica was associated with professional boxing. There was insufficient evidence to support an association between TBI and both multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. TBI appeared to produce a host of postconcussive symptoms (eg, memory problems, dizziness, and irritability). Moderate and severe TBI were associated with endocrine problems such as hypopituitarism and growth hormone deficiency and possibly with diabetes insipidus. There was only limited evidence of an association between mild TBI and the development of ocular/visual motor deterioration. Conclusion TBI is strongly associated with several neurologic disorders 6 months or more after injury. Clinicians caring for TBI patients should monitor them closely for the development of these disorders. While some of these disorders can be treated after they arise (eg, seizures), a greater public health benefit would be achieved by preventing them before they develop. Research efforts to develop therapies aimed at secondary prevention are currently underway.",

The under-recognition of neurological manifestations may lead to an increase in the burden of acute disease as well as secondary complications with long-term consequences. Nervous system infection or dysfunction during pandemics is common and its enduring consequences, especially among vulnerable populations, are frequently forgotten. An improved understanding the possible mechanisms of neurological damage during epidemics, and increased recognition of the possible manifestations is fundamental to bring insights when dealing with future outbreaks. To reverse this gap in knowledge, we reviewed all the pandemics, large and important epidemics of human history in which neurological manifestations are evident, and described the possible physiological processes that leads to the adverse sequelae caused or triggered by those pathogens.",

      "title": "Continuous Deep Sedation Until Death: Palliation or Physician-Assisted Death?",
      "abstract": "Published literature has not discerned end-of-life palliative versus life-shortening effects of pharmacologically maintaining continuous deep sedation until death (i.e., dying in deep sleep) compared with common sedation practices relieving distress in the final conscious phase of dying. Continuous deep sedation predictably suppresses brainstem vital centers and shortens life. Continuous deep sedation remains controversial as palliation for existential suffering and in elective death requests by discontinuation of chronic ventilation or circulatory support with mechanical devices. Continuous deep sedation contravenes the double-effect principle because: (1) it induces permanent coma (intent of action) for the contingency relief of suffering and for social isolation (desired outcomes) and (2) because of its predictable and proportional life-shortening effect. Continuous deep sedation should be distinguished from common sedation practices for palliation and characterized instead as physician-assisted death.",

      "title": "Neurological Deterioration in Wilson's Disease—Types, Etiology, Course, and Management",
      "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism in which pathological copper accumulation, mainly in the liver and the brain, leads to hepatic and/or neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms. Chelators and zinc salts can successfully induce negative copper balance in many patients; however, neurological deterioration may still be observed. This phenomenon can be divided into: (1) early `paradoxical' neurological deterioration, which usually develops in the first 6 months of anti-copper treatment and may be commonly related to drug type, or (2) late neurological deterioration, which mostly occurs after 6 months of treatment and is often related either to non-compliance with treatment, overtreatment resulting in copper deficiency, or adverse drug reactions. Another explanation, especially for early neurological deterioration, is natural WD progression, which can be difficult to differentiate from drug-related deterioration, but usually leads to a worse outcome. There is still no consensus on how to define neurological deterioration in WD using scales or biomarkers, how to distinguish it from the natural disease progression, its risk factors, and optimal management. This narrative review, based on the current literature, aims to provide definitions, prevalence, pathological mechanisms and factors related to neurological deterioration, and also proposes schemes for diagnosis and treatment.",

This is a condition that can have long-term effects (especially if the duration is &gt;30 minutes) such as death, injury, and changes in neuronal tissue depending on the type and duration of the seizure. The human brain consumes a very disproportionate amount of energy given its relatively small size, thus requiring a system capable of balancing cellular oxygen metabolism and brain blood flow control in order to maintain brain oxygen levels. Seizures have been shown to cause changes in oxygen levels beyond the normoxic range, which increases the likelihood that seizure-induced changes in brain pO2 may affect brain function during and after seizures. Decreased oxygenation is common during epileptic seizures. This has been seen on digital pulse oximetry (which measures oxygenation of either the fingers or toes) in the 25-33% saturation range when they have seizures. Such hypoxemia is more common in seizures that are generalized (ie begin as or become generalized tonic-clonic seizures) and/or prolonged.",

      "title": "Ketamine In Acute and Chronic Pain Management",
      "abstract": "Acute and chronic pain remain important health problems both in the United States and worldwide. With the rise in the prevalence of many chronic degenerative diseases across the globe, the distribution and absolute numbers of persons experiencing acute and chronic pain have continued to increase. As a result, pain management has come to the forefront of the public health community.The manifestation of pain itself typically involves the peripheral and central nervous systems. Pain can classify as nociceptive, neuropathic or nocicplastic in origin. Nociceptive pain, also referred to as physiologic pain, results from activation of primary nociceptive afferents by actual or potential tissue-damaging stimuli. In nociceptive pain, large nerve integrity remains preserved as sensory receptors are stimulated within visceral and somatic structures. In contrast to nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain results for direct injury or disease affecting the somatosensory system and tends to be more disabling than nociceptive pain. Neuropathic pain subdivides into peripheral (e.g. diabetic neuropathy) and central (e.g., spinal cord injury or central poststroke pain), while nociceptive pain subcategorizes into somatic or visceral (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease). Recently, the International Association for the Study of Pain added a third category to pain classification of taxonomy for conditions that do not neatly fit into neuropathic or nocicplastic categories. Nociplastic pain refers to pain that arises from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage or evidence a disease or lesion directly affecting the somatosensory system. Conditions considered to be nocicplastic pain include fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I, and irritable bowel syndrome. One should keep in mind that there are several pain conditions, such as failed back surgery syndrome, that contain elements of more than one pain category, and can be classified as “mixed” pain states. In addition, conditions that are clearly classified as nociceptive and neuropathic often contain overlapping mechanisms with nocicplastic pain in that they involve abnormal nociceptive processing (e.g. amplified pain signals, expansion of receptive fields, decreased descending modulation). Pain can also categorize as acute, chronic, or a combination of these types (e.g. sickle cell crisis). Acute pain arises from a specific disease or injury and its duration is typically self-limited. Acute pain is considered to serve a protective biological purpose and is often associated with muscle spasm and sympathetic nervous system activation. In contrast, chronic pain may be considered a disease state, with its duration outlasting the normal time of healing when associated with disease or injury. Chronic pain may also stem from psychological states and does not serve an apparent biological purpose. Unlike the self-limited nature of acute pain, chronic pain often does not have a recognizable endpoint.",

The clinical features of delirium predominantly involve subacute changes in cognition, awareness, and activity levels, behavioral disturbance, clouding consciousness, and sleep-wake cycle changes. In contrast, epilepsy involves the acute interruption of brain function, often with convulsive activity, falls, and injury. States that may share the clinical features of both, such as nonconvulsive epileptic states, are also important: the cause of brain derangement is one of excessive and abnormal electrical brain activity. In such conditions, the clinical manifestations may resemble states of delirium and confusion, and the absence of convulsive clinical activity is significant. Electroencephalography remains the diagnostic test of choice: it is essential for differentiating these two conditions, enabling the distinctly different treatments and epilepsy. Ongoing research and investigation are essential to better understand the abnormal brat mechanisms underlying delirium, and to develop better tools for objective diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury is an injury which can temporarily or permanently damage the brain function. Brain trauma has a relatively poor prognosis and such patients will often have reduced work ability and a high possibility to stay temporarily or permanently disabled. That is why such injuries are a major public health issue since even less severe brain injuries can result in permanent neuropsychological disorders that affect work ability and quality of life. Traumatic injury can be divided into two phases, primary and secondary. Primary injury is the result of the mechanical force that acts upon the head and brain structures. The development of secondary injury begins after the emergence of the primary and lasts for several days. During this period the damage increases and it is of vital importance to try to reduce the extent of the damage to the affected tissue. Hyperoxia is defined as a greater than normal oxygen percent in the tissues and organs, caused by increased delivery of oxygen or increased percentage o fit in the arterial blood. It can be achieved in normobaric and hyperbaric conditions. Normobaric hyperoxia is achieved under atmospheric conditions, whereas hyperbaric is achieved at pressures higher than atmospheric.\r\nIn the treatment of traumatic brain injury, the main goal is to preserve brain function and reduce the extent of tissue damage. Most important thing is, except ICP control, to maintain proper tissue perfusion and to provide aerobic metabolism. Studies have shown that hyperoxia leads to improved oxygenation and increased aerobic metabolism of injured tissue. In conclusion, further research in this area is needed in order to clearly identify groups of patients that should be recommended for hyperoxia treatment.",

An addictive drug that mimics or blocks a neurotransmitter or receptor is like a weight thrown suddenly onto one side (let’s call it the drug side) of a balanced seesaw. The sum of all the adaptations is like a counterweight added slowly to the opposite side (the adapting side) until the level state is reached again. If a drug floods the brain suddenly (a drug spike), an immediate change in brain function results. In the vernacular, if this effect is hedonic (pleasurable), it is called a drug “high;” the drug side of the seesaw drops. If the same drug is trickled slowly into the brain instead of spiking, adaptations can occur even while the drug level is increasing; the “high” is muted or nearly absent, while a plateau drug level is established.",

A variety of gestational and early-life variables contribute to normative neurocognitive development with countless events potentially hindering successful neural development. Recent research suggests that anesthesia has the potential to negatively affect fetal brain development both prenatally and perinatally. Some of the anesthesiology research suggests that under certain circumstances, children may have a heightened risk for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disorders, and perhaps other issues. Though there are no prospective studies evaluating neurocognitive function in children after neonatal exposure to anesthetics, there are several retrospective reviews that demonstrate temporary neurological sequelae after prolonged anesthetic exposure in young children and larger studies identifying long-term neurodevelopmental impairment after neonatal surgery and anesthesia. Studies also suggest a heightened vulnerability likely during the first trimester, particularly when neurons are undergoing rapid development. Specifically, heightened vulnerability to cerebral dysfunction tends to be associated with exposure to multiple anesthetic agents, longer duration of exposure, and multiple episodes of exposure to anesthetic agents.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive episode (MDE) is a chronic disease typified by episodes that remit and recur. It is a major contributor to the burden of disease. The diagnosis of a disorder is an expert opinion that the disorder is present. The nine symptoms of MDE exist on dimensions of greater or lesser intensity, persistence over time, change in usual state, distress and impairment. It is the clinician's task to judge whether the elicited symptoms warrant the diagnosis. The surprise is that trained clinicians can do this reliably and that diagnostic interviews and questionnaires can emulate this process. The distribution of symptoms in community surveys is exponential, with no obvious discontinuity at the diagnostic threshold. Taxometric and primary care studies confirm this. The number of symptoms predicts severity, comorbidity, family history, disability, help seeking and treatment recommendations. The latent structure of mental disorders places MDE in the distress misery cluster. Measures of well-being, distress, disability and neuroticism correlate with the number of symptoms but the relation is not perfect. The Patient Health Questionnaire is derived from the diagnostic criteria and does not suffer this limitation. The introduction of measures like this would acknowledge dimensionality, would facilitate recognition, guide treatment, and be acceptable to consumers, providers and funders.

      "title": "The Diagnosis and Work-Up of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Most adults have difficulty sleeping at some time in their lives, with problems falling asleep, staying asleep, or having nonrestorative sleep. When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

      "title": "The ICSD-3 and DSM-5 guidelines for diagnosing narcolepsy: clinical relevance and practicality",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disease manifesting as difficulty with maintaining continuous wake and sleep. Clinical presentation varies but requires excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) occurring alone or together with features of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep dissociation (e.g., cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis), and disrupted nighttime sleep. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is associated with reductions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin due to destruction of hypocretin peptide-producing neurons in the hypothalamus in individuals with a specific genetic predisposition. Updated diagnostic criteria include the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Sleep Disorders Third Edition (ICSD-3). DSM-5 criteria require EDS in association with any one of the following: (1) cataplexy; (2) CSF hypocretin deficiency; (3) REM sleep latency ≤15 minutes on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG); or (4) mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) with ≥2 sleep-onset REM-sleep periods (SOREMPs). ICSD-3 relies more upon objective data in addition to EDS, somewhat complicating the diagnostic criteria: 1) cataplexy and either positive MSLT/PSG findings or CSF hypocretin deficiency; (2) MSLT criteria similar to DSM-5 except that a SOREMP on PSG may count as one of the SOREMPs required on MSLT; and (3) distinct division of narcolepsy into type 1, which requires the presence of cataplexy or documented CSF hypocretin deficiency, and type 2, where cataplexy is absent, and CSF hypocretin levels are either normal or undocumented. We discuss limitations of these criteria such as variability in clinical presentation of cataplexy, particularly when cataplexy may be ambiguous, as well as by age; multiple and/or invasive CSF diagnostic test requirements; and lack of normative diagnostic test data (e.g., MSLT) in certain populations. While ICSD-3 criteria reflect narcolepsy pathophysiology, DSM-5 criteria have greater clinical practicality, suggesting that valid and reliable biomarkers to help standardize narcolepsy diagnosis would be welcomed.",

      "title": "Peculiarities of insomnia in men and women at different age periods",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

Individuals who were judged to be demented at a mean age of eighty-five years had achieved lower scores on most tests twenty years prior to diagnosis, and experienced greater declines in vocabulary and forward digit span over time, than those surviving to a comparable age without dementia. These trends were observed for individuals with mild, as well as moderate-to-severe, dementia and were unrelated to physical health status or premorbid activity patterns. It is suggested that dementing illness may develop very slowly, and that the likelihood of exhibiting clinically significant dementia may vary with premorbid intellectual level.",

      "abstract": "It is widely accepted that childhood convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) has associated short-term and long-term mortality and morbidity. However, the role of CSE itself on subsequent adverse outcomes is still debated. In addition, whether prolonged seizures cause any long-term hippocampal injury and developmental or memory impairment is uncertain. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of long-term outcomes after childhood CSE, highlighting data from recent literature on this subject.Long-term outcome after childhood CSE is favorable in previously normal children, with low incidence of epilepsy, motor and intellectual disability, behavioral impairment and need for special educational provision. Mesial temporal sclerosis is uncommon in children after prolonged febrile seizures. There is substantial morbidity after childhood CSE, but this is seen primarily in children with symptomatic causes and preexisting neurological abnormalities. Cause is the primary determinant of outcomes after childhood CSE and the additional effect of CSE characteristics such as seizure duration seems to be less than previously believed.Childhood CSE is associated with substantial neurological, cognitive and behavioral morbidity. Early identification of these difficulties and appropriate intervention are likely to have a major positive impact on their quality of life.",

Today, hypoxia is considered to be an essential cause of such lesions; in contrast to views held previously, birth trauma, i.e., physical injury to an infant during its delivery, is of minor pathogenetic importance. Neurohistological studies showed that it is especially prolonged hypoxia - in addition to cerebral hemorrhage, damage to the cerebral parenchyma and medullary substance - which can cause lesion of the brain stem. A relatively frequent occurrence are isolated ischemic cerebrospinal nerve cell lesions. Their prognostic dignity in regard to the possible formation of synapses and the problem of damage to the neuroglia are as yet imperfectly understood.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurological problem and encompasses a variety of functional, anatomical, and pathological disturbances. Patients suffering from chronic pain of neuropathic origin experience worsened health and greater disability than those not suffering from this type of pain. Disorders of the peripheral nervous system, including sensory disturbance, are commonly seen in adults. Peripheral neuropathy has a prevalence of 2.4% in the general population and increases with age to an estimated 8% in those over 55 years of age. Nerve fibers affected by peripheral neuropathy may serve motor, sensory, or autonomic functions; the fibers may be large or small; the distribution of neuropathic involvement may be proximal, distal, or multifocal; and the onset of symptoms may be acute (less than 3 weeks), subacute (3 weeks to 3 months), or chronic (over 3 months). Peripheral neuropathy may occur as a result of several common and many rare diseases, but the most common cause is diabetes. Diseases of the peripheral nervous system may involve muscles (myopathies), nerves (neuropathies, with axons and myelin being affected), and neuromuscular junctions. The subject of peripheral neuropathy; its anatomy; and physiology, classification, evaluation, treatment, and prognosis is an extremely broad topic, and the intent of this chapter is to present a summary review, not an exhaustive analysis of the subject.",

The EEG shows a generalized spike-wave activity. In status psychomotoricus, the clinical symptomatology varies from case to case. It can be characterized by anxiety, dreamy states or productive-psychotic states with agitation, automatisms and hallucinations. In the EEG a temporal or temporally-accentuated epileptic activity will be recorded. Transitional and mixed forms of petit mal status and status psychomotoricus can also be found. I.v. injections of benzodiazepines (clonazepam, diazepam) are an appropriate therapy for any type of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Phenytoin is indicated in status psychomotoricus, but contra-indicated in the case of petit mal status.",

The clinical significance of the short term effects reported is not clear. Furthermore, in many cases the inclusion criteria differ significantly from those currently accepted for dementia studies. In particular, many studies were performed in mixed population of patients with mental decline of varying etiology, rather than with clearly defined dementia of the Alzheimer type or other specific disorders. Similarly, the sample sizes involved were often low compared to current standards, and in some instances may have been determined based more on practical than on statistical considerations.",

Early onset combined to the secretiveness that frequently characterises the condition, as well as patient's beliefs that OC symptoms do not represent a medical condition and that OCD can remit spontaneously, are all factors contributing to delayed diagnosis and first treatment, particularly of pharmacological nature.Methods: In this short report, authors performed a review of the most recent literature in the field.Conclusions: The current literature clearly delineates a duration of untreated illness of several years (around 7 years in the majority of the reports), which represented, on average, a portion ranging between the 40 and 70% of the overall duration of untreated illness.",

Treatment options depend on the cause. Toxic, metabolic and nutritional, and immune-mediated consequences of clinically occult neoplasms produce a spectrum of neurological diseases, recognition of which has therapeutic and prognostic importance.Children, as well as adults who presented to the authors in the last 5 years with neurological diseases and later their diseases could be diagnosed or attributed to neoplasms which were occult, were included for the study.28 patients were seen by the authors in the last 5 years with neurological manifestation and hidden tumor. Maximum incidence was in the age of above 60 years followed by the age group of 21-40 years. The commonest neurological presentation was muscle and nerve in adults and seizure in children.Short duration, rapid progression, severe weight loss, and poor response to treatment given for nontumor associated neurological syndrome are the red flags which point to the diagnosis.Seizures and psychosis formed the commonest features in children, muscle and nerve in adults. Short duration, rapid progression, and resistance to treatment are the markers for possible underlying neoplasm.",

Here we present a case report in which even though the patient was hanged for more than five minutes until the formation of a ligature mark and exhibited cyanosis, unconsciousness and seizures, the outcome was favourable with prompt and early intervention.

      "title": "Epilepsy: Treatment Options.",
      "abstract": "The occurrence of a single seizure does not always require initiation of antiepileptic drugs. Risk of recurrent seizures should guide their use. In adults, key risk factors for recurrence are two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography, abnormal brain imaging, nocturnal seizures, or an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures. In children, key risk factors are abnormal electroencephalography results, an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures, severe head trauma, and cerebral palsy. The risk of adverse effects from antiepileptic drugs is considerable and includes potential cognitive and behavioral effects. In the absence of risk factors, and because many patients do not experience recurrence of a seizure, physicians should consider delaying use of antiepileptic drugs until a second seizure occurs. Delaying therapy until a second seizure does not affect one- to two-year remission rates. Treatment should begin with monotherapy. The appropriate choice of medication varies depending on seizure type. Routine monitoring of drug levels is not correlated with reduction in adverse effects or improvement in effectiveness and is not recommended. When patients have been seizure free for two to five years, discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs may be considered. For patients with seizures that are not controlled with these agents, alternative treatments include surgical resection of the seizure focus, ketogenic diets, vagus nerve stimulators, and implantable brain neurostimulators. Patients who have had a recent seizure within the past three months or whose seizures are poorly controlled should refrain from driving and certain high-risk physical activities. Patients planning for pregnancy should know that antiepileptic drugs are possibly teratogenic.",

A falha na memória é uma das queixas mais recorrentes nesta faixa etária, podendo ser consequência de uma série de fatores, dentre eles a depressão e o declínio cognitivo leve (DCL). A avaliação neuropsicológica pode ser utilizada como ferramenta para auxiliar na confirmação de quadros diagnósticos, diferenciando sintomas cognitivos e psiquiátricos. Explorar as dificuldades do diagnóstico diferencial entre a depressão e o declínio cognitivo na pessoa idosa. Estudo de caso único realizado a partir de uma avaliação neuropsicológica com uma idosa de 72 anos com queixa de falhas na memória. Verificou-se que a examinanda não apresentava dificuldades cognitivas proeminentes no momento da avaliação nem dificuldades significativas em suas atividades de vida diária: residia sozinha, fazia as compras da casa, realizava o pagamento das contas sem auxílio e utilizava o transporte público para se deslocar, evidenciando capacidade funcional preservada. No entanto, ela sofreu uma série de perdas em um curto período de tempo: saída dos filhos de casa, diminuição do poder aquisitivo e afastamento de atividades de lazer. A distinção dos sintomas de um DCL e um transtorno depressivo pode ser extremamente complexa. Por vezes, os sintomas se sobrepõem, podendo o DCL ser um fator desencadeante para o transtorno depressivo ou mutuamente. Na ocasião da avaliação, as falhas na memória da examinanda foram melhor explicadas pela depressão. A depressão pode afetar tanto a memória de curto como a de longo prazo, interferindo no processo de aquisição e resgate do que foi memorizado, bem como acarretar falhas atencionais uma vez que, quando o estímulo não é recebido, não pode ser recordado.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The drug-induced movement disorders discussed in this chapter are uncommon, consisting of less than 24% of all drug-induced movement disorders and less than 0.7% of all spontaneously reported adverse drug reactions [1]. The prompt identification of these disorders by the specialist neurologist or general physician prescribing the drug is critical in the effective management of the patient and in some cases the prevention of long-term sequelae. Much of the evidence that a drug causes a movement disorder is based on single case reports. It is therefore often difficult to know for certain whether there is a causal relationship. Movement disorders which improve after drug withdrawal are more likely to be attributable to the drug and can be confirmed by reintroduction of the drug (ethically this be can only justified if it is important for the patient's long-term therapy). However, we should be alert to the possibility that some drugsmay cause irreversible cellular changes which could either be the sole cause of the movement disorder or contribute in some way to its generation in susceptible individuals.",

      "title": "Moderating Effect of Cognitive Reserve on Brain Integrity and Cognitive Performance",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is arguably the most devastating condition of older adulthood with treatment options still elusive. Alzheimer’s is the most prevalent form of dementia where cognitive deficits relate strongly to underlying brain pathology. However, there exist cases in which cognitive performance does not match the corresponding level of neuropathology. Attempts to explain this phenomenon often include the concept of cognitive reserve (CR), whereby greater CR (e.g., more education or higher occupational position) presumably results in less impairment relative to the extent of pathology early in disease progression but also greater impairment once cognitive symptoms manifest. We examined the influence of CR proxy variables (education and occupation) on the relationship between hippocampal volume and cognitive performance on tests of executive control and memory using data from the Czech Brain Aging Study (CBAS). Participants were cognitively normal/with subjective cognitive decline but without actual impairment (CN; n=115; M(age)=66.43; M(education)=15.90; 37 men) or had amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; n=165; M(age)=71.37; M(education)=14.92; 85 men). We found that hippocampal volume was significantly related to executive control (b=-.0001, p=.03) and memory (b=.0002, p&amp;lt;.001) for participants with aMCI, but only memory (b=.0002, p=.03) for CN participants. Occupational position moderated the association between memory and hippocampal volume in aMCI, with the result approaching significance (p=.07), whereby a greater link between memory problems and hippocampal atrophy was present in those previously in high occupational positions. No other moderations for occupational position or education emerged (ps&amp;gt;.25). We found evidence for the concept of CR using occupational position as proxy.",

      "title": "Reversible dementias.",
      "abstract": "In recent years, more attention has been given to the early diagnostic evaluation of patients with dementia which is essential to identify patients with cognitive symptoms who may have treatable conditions. Guidelines suggest that all patients presenting with dementia or cognitive symptoms should be evaluated with a range of laboratory tests, and with structural brain imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While many of the disorders reported as 'reversible dementias' are conditions that may well be associated with cognitive or behavioral symptoms, these symptoms are not always sufficiently severe to fulfill the clinical criteria for dementia. Thus, while the etiology of a condition may be treatable it should not be assumed that the associated dementia is fully reversible. Potentially reversible dementias should be identified and treatment considered, even if the symptoms are not sufficiently severe to meet the clinical criteria for dementia, and even if partial or full reversal of the cognitive symptoms cannot be guaranteed. In the literature, the most frequently observed potentially reversible conditions identified in patients with cognitive impairment or dementia are depression, adverse effects of drugs, drug or alcohol abuse, space-occupying lesions, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and metabolic conditions land endocrinal conditions like hypothyroidism and nutritional conditions like vitamin B-12 deficiency. Depression is by far the most common of the potentially reversible conditions. The review, hence addresses the common causes of reversible dementia and the studies published so far.",

Agents as varied as head injuries and metals are known to cause from loss of memory or behavior disorders to chronic toxic encephalopathy or Parkinsonism. There is little data on exposure to neurotoxic agents or disorders of the central nervous system caused by work and what there is not reliable.

In all these cases, dopaminergic treatment can be helpful.

In brief, every patient who undergoes major surgery experiences an electrolyte disturbance that may cause a psychotic or delirious reaction. Whether it does or not will depend on three factors: (1) the severity of the disturbance; (2) the treatment provided to control it, and (3) the presence of other factors which contribute to clouding of consciousness, such as sedation, hypoxia, fever, toxins, and circulatory collapse or impairment.

      "title": "Paradoxical effects of drugs on cognitive function: the neuropsychopharmacology of the dopamine and other neurotransmitter systems",
      "abstract": "Neurotransmitters are the means by which one neuron influences the action of another. Abnormalities in neurotransmitter function are implicated in a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders and drugs that influence the neurotransmitter systems are often used in treating the symptoms of such disorders. The effects of these drugs can be paradoxical. A small dose of a pharmacological agent might have entirely the opposite effect to a large dose, a drug may improve one ability whilst impairing another, a drug may have opposite effects in different populations or opposite effects in the same individual at different times. In this chapter, we illustrate these effects using clinical data and data from healthy volunteers in experimental studies. With one of the best studied neuromodulators – dopamine – as our focus, we introduce key principles that can help to explain these apparent paradoxes. First, the effect of a drug depends on baseline levels of the neurotransmitter already in the system. When baseline levels are low, a given pharmacological dose can increase function closer to an optimal level. When baseline levels are high, the same dose can over-stimulate the system and trigger compensatory mechanisms that reduce performance on a given task. Second, a drug could have quite different effects in different brain regions. Accordingly, a function that is predominantly influenced by one region may be enhanced, whilst another function, more dependent on another region, may be impaired. In the final section of the chapter, we turn to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",

MemoryDefects of memory are either in the registration of new experience (antegrade) or the recall of past experience (retrograde).In gross dementia the patient may lose the ability to repeat a series of numbers he has just heard.This immediate type of defect is also seen in dysphasia, or whenever attention or concentration is dis- tracted-as in depression or acute confusional states.Short term memory deficit is tested by inviting the recall of a few numbers and two or three names after five minutes of other conversation.The limbic system, including the mamillary bodies and hippocampus, must be intact for new experience to be registered and recent events recollected.In Korsakow's amnesia, where the main damage is in the mamillary bodies, antegrade amnesia-learning ability-is permanently damaged and several years ofexperience are lost.After head injury an antegrade defect is noted but this is temporary.The retrograde amnesia shrinks until minutes or seconds before the accident.Deep memory, including childhood events, can be retained and recalled when limbic structures no longer function.The long term memory is tested by asking for details of the patient and his family and about important people or events.Moments of great personal pleasure or poignancy can be recalled most clearly.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders are defined as syndromes characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation or behavior, which reflect a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. These are often associated with suffering or disabilities. It is known that one of the striking characteristics of certain disorders is related to their chronicity, which reduces the possibility of a cure and raises the discussion about controlling their symptoms to maintain the quality of life of individuals who suffer from them. A little associated but relevant intervention, if the state of chronic users in mental health is analyzed, is palliative care and its palliative actions that do not seek a cure, but to offer the maximum possible comfort to the user from diagnosis until their last day of life. Objective: Gather and analyze information regarding palliative psychiatry and its benefits for patients with mental disorders. Methodology: Articles published in indexed journals in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SCIELO), National Library of Medicine/NLM (MEDLINE), and National Library of Medicine/NLM (PUBMED) databases were evaluated, in addition to official sites such as the Ministry of Health of Brazil and the World Health Organization, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. Results and Discussion: After completing the data collection phase, 33 relevant articles were identified for analysis of the proposed theme. It has been noted that palliative psychiatry encompasses a wide range of issues, including widely known mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression, severe mental illnesses refractory to treatment, neuropalliative care, and symptom burden at various levels. Furthermore, it addresses ethical and psychosocial problems, psychological suffering, personality, desire and desire to die, dignity, loneliness, social isolation, as well as psychopharmacology. And that this care would be advantageous and of fundamental importance to patients with serious mental illnesses. Conclusion: Given the new perspectives for mental health care in an increasingly humanized way, the articles highlighted the benefits of palliative psychiatry and its importance in improving the quality of life of patients with serious mental disorders. However, it was also observed that many barriers need to be overcome to guarantee quality care for the group in question.",

      "title": "Delirium and Dementia",
      "abstract": "Emergency physicians are frequently presented with patients exhibiting neurobehavioral abnormalities. These can be a harbin­ ger of a serious medical condition, and critical decisions must be made expeditiously about diagnostic evaluation, therapeutic intervention, and disposition. The first critical action is to recog­ nize the presence of the neurobehavioral abnormality. The second is to distinguish delirium from dementia or some other neuropsy­ chiatric condition. In the past, terms such as acute confusional state, sundowning, and organic brain syndrome have been used to describe a host of abnormal cognitive states that can be observed in the emer­ gency setting. These terms have loosely defined a group of neurobehavioral disorders that are caused by a physiologic dis­ turbance. Organic brain syndrome is a nebulous term that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition, text revision) eschews because the “organic” connotation implies that so­called functional mental disorders are without a biologic basis. Several key features best distinguish delirium from dementia: the time course of disease evolution, the presence of autonomic system involvement, the level of consciousness, and the presence of an underlying disease processes. Delirium is characterized by a fluctuating level of neurobehavioral disturbance typically pro­ gressing during minutes to hours to days. Delirium is a direct consequence of an acute systemic or central nervous system (CNS) stressor. Dementia, on the other hand, tends to follow a more gradual course, with evolution during months to years. Although patients with dementia exhibit confusion, disturbance in level of consciousness usually is not a feature, and manifestations of auto­ nomic nervous system abnormalities are minimal or absent. The evaluation of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with a disturbance of neurobehavioral state is best conducted in accordance with the following basic guidelines: 1. The first step is to determine whether this state represents delirium or dementia. The clinical findings may be subtle, and establishment of the diagnosis can be challenging, especially because delirium may be superimposed on dementia and dementia remains an independent risk factor for delirium. Early symptoms and signs may go unrecognized unless an adequate history is obtained from the patient, family members, and caregivers. A careful examination must include memory and cognitive assessment with a mental status screening examination. 2. Supportive care must be provided. This care may range in extent from aggressive airway and cardiovascular support to pharmacologic or physical restraint to simply placing the patient in a quiet room with appropriate environmental support. 3. A diligent search must be initiated for the underlying precipitating stressors in patients presenting with delirium.",

Due to symptom overlap and comorbidity between narcolepsy and other psychiatric disorders, narcolepsy in children and adolescents can be easily misdiagnosed. Diagnostic delay is common. Method: We review the clinical presentations, epidemiology, etiology, diagnostic criteria, and treatment of this disabling disorder. We also present three examples of cases initially diagnosed as either a medical or psychiatric disorder, leading to a delay in management ranging from seven months to seven years. Discussion: These cases highlight the importance for psychiatrists and other mental health professionals who work with adolescents to become familiar with this uncommon disorder to shorten time to treatment of this patient population.

The initial stable levodopa benefit, termed the “long-duration response,” begins to give way to responses increasingly tied to each dose, the so-called “short-duration response.” During the initial treatment years when long duration responses predominate, the timing of the doses is not important, except for taking them without food; doses can be missed without a decline in benefit. However, after several years or longer, the benefit begins to fluctuate; the response develops within an hour or so after each dose, persists for a few hours or less, and then declines. This concept is graphically depicted in figure 17.1. Occasional patients with long-standing Parkinson’s disease (PD) will experience responses lasting only 1–2 hours, which mirrors the plasma levodopa half-life of 1.5–2 hours.",

Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.\n\nLike seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.\n\nSeizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.\n\nBHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, …",

      "abstract": "Article AbstractThe co-occurrence of a severe mental illness and a substance abuse or dependence disorder is common enough to be considered the expectation more than the exception. Substance use disorders can occur at any phase of mental illness. Causes of this comorbidity may include self-medication, genetic vulnerability, environment or lifestyle, underlying shared origins, and/or a common neural substrate. The consequences of dual diagnosis include poor medication compliance, physical comorbidities, poor health, poor self-care, increased risk of suicide or risky behavior, and even possible incarceration. All of these factors contribute to increased burden and reduced capacity of the health care system to adequately treat patients. Screening, assessment, and integrated treatment plans for dual diagnosis to address both the substance use disorder and the mental illness are strongly recommended. This CME activity is expired.

The younger the subjects, however, the wider are the variations. In the first stage of life only massive cerebral lesions afford unquestionable EEG evidence: in evaluating dysrhythmias it is necessary to bear in mind their high incidence in normal subjects. Hence their meaning is to be understood only by prolonged longitudinal studies. The reference here is not only to diffuse or focal slow anomalies, but also to specific pathologic rhythms. The difficulty of interpreting such anomalies is particularly evident when epileptogenic potentials are found, since they may be signs of a lesion but their clinical correlations are uncertain. The concept of \"masked epilepsy\" must be rejected. Only the diagnoses of latent or proven epilepsy are admissible, and these epilepsies may be without direct relationship to the clinical, psychiatric or central nervous findings in the affected subject. Numerous genetic, afferential, emotional or biologic factors are involved in the development of non-lesional disorders. Accordingly, the EEG has only a minor contribution to make in the definition of mild focal or diffuse pathologic anatomy of the brain in the very young subject.",

Although the duration and severity of brain ischemia is often difficult to determine, clinicians are often faced with difficult issues related to predicting outcome related to awakening and long-term neurological deficits after the arrest. Neurological impairments range from mild cognitive deficits to severe motor and cognitive deficits that preclude independence in many activities of daily living. Several neurological syndromes have been described in patients who awaken from hypoxic-ischemic coma with lasting motor and cognitive deficits.

Clinically significant aberrant test performance may be noted after chemical exposure as well as with other diseases of the CNS.

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state.

      "abstract": "Acute and chronic insomnia are common and difficult clinical problems that contribute to and are consequences of other mental and physical health problems. It is tempting to treat insomnia with medications for rapid relief; however, these medications have significant side effects that add health burden and may cause tolerance and dependency. First-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I); however, this is less frequently prescribed than benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotic agents. Prudent primary care and mental health clinicians should screen for insomnia using valid and reliable tools when clients report sleep difficulties. When screening is positive, further assessment with a sleep diary is warranted. The primary treatment for insomnia is CBT-I, and pharmacological treatment may provide temporary support for no more than 2 to 4 weeks. Non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents, histamine blocking medications, dual orexin receptor antagonists, and over-the-counter herbal supplements may serve as adjuncts.

Drug withdrawal occurs as the body removes addictive substances from the circulation. It is characterized by central nervous system (CNS) hyperirritability, gastrointestinal dysfunction, respiratory distress, sleep disturbances, and autonomic instability. Major drugs of abuse include opioids, CNS stimulants, CNS depressants, and hallucinogens, all of which can cause NAS symptoms in the newborn. Iatrogenic withdrawal symptoms have been documented in infants on fentanyl or morphine intravenous drips to maintain continuous analgesia during such therapies as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and mechanical ventilation. Premature infants may have less severe NAS symptoms compared to term infants. Treatment for NAS includes the use of drug therapy to relieve moderate to severe symptoms of withdrawal. Therapy varies with institutional guidelines and provider decision.",

      "abstract": "Occasional trouble sleeping is part of the human condition, but persistent insomnia is not. Pharmacotherapy is the most common treatment for insomnia. Benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, and melatonin receptor agonists are among the most studied compounds for the treatment of insomnia. These compounds differ in their sites of action in the brain, their half-lives, and their durations of action. These differences allow clinicians to make therapeutic choices based on the specific sleep needs of individual patients. For example, medications with a rapid onset of action and a short half-life are likely to be effective for sleep initiation but unlikely to improve sleep maintenance. A compound with a longer half-life would be expected to sustain sleep on a more extended basis but could lead to residual sedation. A (theoretically) ideal compound for promoting and sustaining sleep over a desired period of time would be one with an immediate onset of action, a sustained effect for the desired duration of effect, and rapid reduction in effect after this period of time. The benzodiazepines tend to have longer half-lives than the nonbenzodiazepines but carry a greater risk for residual sedation. The melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon has a short half-life and is not indicated for sleep maintenance.",

      "abstract": "Chemical dependency is a common, chronic disease that affects up to 25 percent of patients seen in primary care practices. The treatment goal for patients recovering from chemical dependency should be to avoid relapse. This requires physicians to have an open, nonjudgmental attitude and specific expertise about the implications of addiction for other health problems. First-line treatment for chemical dependency should be nonpharmacologic, but when medication is necessary, physicians should avoid drugs that have the potential for abuse or addiction. Medications that sedate or otherwise impair judgment also should be avoided in the recovering patient. Psychiatric illnesses should be aggressively treated, because untreated symptoms increase the risk of relapse into chemical dependency. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help to lower alcohol consumption in depressed patients, and desipramine may help to facilitate abstinence in persons addicted to cocaine. If insomnia extends beyond the acute or postacute withdrawal period, trazodone may be an effective treatment. If nonpharmacologic management of pain is not possible, nonaddictive medications should be used. However, if non-addictive medications fail, long-acting opiates used under strict supervision may be considered. Uncontrolled pain in itself is a relapse risk.",

Its more significant characteristic is its invariable association with other serious illnesses. In more than half of the cases it is seen in chronic alcoholic patients or in chronic illnesses accompanied by malnutrition or hydroelectrolytic disturbances. It is not related to sex or the age group. The most frequent cause is the treatment of hyponatremia, when there is a too rapid increase of the sodium levels. The basic lesion is the destruction of the myelin sheaths, with relatively unharmed axon; and it affects part or the whole base of the protuberance in a symmetrical form (pontine demyelination). The patients suffering from this illness usually present subacute progressive tetraparesis accompanied by pseudobulbar paralysis with dysarthria and the impossibility of protruding the tongue, together with partial or total paralysis of the ocular horizontal movements. Some patients present mutism and a state of paralysis with preservation of understanding and the sensory ways (pseudocoma or locked-in syndrome). The diagnosis of certainty of this entity is anatomopathologic. Nevertheless, the capacity of the computerized axial tomography (CAT), and especially that of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), to visualize the pontine lesions have largely increased the frequency of the pre-mortem diagnosis. There is not a specific treatment for this illness. It should be prevented avoiding the sharp changes in plasma sodium level in patients with hyponatremia.

However, the long-term effects of subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) on cognition remain unclear. Objective We report short- and long-term effects of STN-DBS on cognition in PD. Methods We analyzed neuropsychological data before STN-DBS surgery, 3-month post-surgery, 1-year post-surgery and in a long-term follow-up (8–15 years post-surgery) to examine the effects of STN-DBS on cognition. Results 81 patients with a mean disease duration of 13.0 years were examined before surgery. 50.6% were identified with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), having a mean disease duration of 14.2 years. Pre-surgical PD-MCI was not associated with clinically diagnosed dementia (PD-D) before death or before long-term follow-up (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.3–2.2, p = 0.714), but disease duration at the time of surgery was associated with development of PD-D (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1–1.3, p = 0.005). Verbal fluency declined significantly 3 months after surgery, while other domains remained unaffected. In neuropsychological testing at long-term follow-up (N = 29), global cognitive impairment or dementia was found in 19 patients. The presence of depressive symptoms before surgery was associated to PD-D at long-term follow-up. Death before long-term follow-up was more common in patients with pre-surgical MCI than in patients with normal cognition. Conclusions Influence on cognition was described in a short- and long-term follow-up study up to 15 years after STN-DBS surgery in PD. Disease duration, but not pre-surgical MCI was associated with development of dementia. Impaired verbal fluency was observed both in a short- and long-term follow-up.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

      "title": "Change In Mental Status",
      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

      "title": "[The role of psychosocial stress in childhood for structural and functional brain development:neurobiological basis of developmental psychopathology].",
      "abstract": "This review summarizes some important principles of human brain development. Special emphasis is placed on the role of psychosocial stress during childhood on the developing brain. Depending on the degree of cognitive, behavioral and socio-emotional maturation, previous experiences and actual context, psychosocial stressors may be perceived by children as being either controllable (challenge) or uncontrollable (disaster). Controllable stress experiences are associated with a preferential activation of the central and peripheral noradrenergic system, i.e., of a system endowed with the gating of cortical information processing and the facilitation and stabilization of neuronal pathways and synaptic connections involved in behavioral responding. Uncontrollable stress responses are elicited if all previously acquired behavioral or cognitive strategies are inadequate or fail to overcome the stressor. The resulting severe and long-lasting activation of the central stress responsive systems will finally lead to a full activation of the HPA system, accompanied by adrenocortical cortisol release. The major central effect of this response is the destabilization of previously established neuronal circuits and synaptic connections. Thus, severe uncontrollable psychosocial stress may act as an important trigger of and a prerequisite for the reorganization of neuronal connectivity. It may, above a certain threshold, threaten the mental and affective stability, integrity, and the future development of a child. The long-term consequences of psychosocial stress on the structural and functional maturation of the brain are documented by findings from animal research and by results in the field of developmental psychopathology in children. The role of risk and protective factors during different phases of child development is briefly summarized and the need for a biopsychosocial model concerning the relationship between human brain development and behavior is emphasized.",

      "abstract": "Early-stage cognitive decline occurs when an individual experiences memory loss or other cognitive impairment but does not meet the criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other dementias. After diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), approximately 5-15 % of cases progress to dementia per year. AD and many other causes of dementia are presently incurable. Early recognition of cognitive decline can allow healthcare providers to reduce the risk of disease progression. Literature is scarce on factors that can increase the incidence of cognitive decline, especially in early ages; this is further exacerbated by difficulty tracking the prevalence of mild cognitive symptoms.",

      "title": "Nonverbal treatment of neurosis; techniques for general practice.",
      "abstract": "\"Psychosomatic medicine\" does not demand that the general practitioner function as a psychiatrist; rather, it is a psychiatric orientation that can increase the effectiveness of purely medical treatment for such conditions as neuroses. The general practitioner to whom the patient turns may achieve permanent results with nonverbal techniques where formal psychotherapy would be impracticable or unacceptable. The first aim is to relieve pressure so that the patient can regain his mental balance and thereby his self-confidence. Arts, hobbies, sports, and the like can be prescribed rather specifically according to the patient's personality and needs. Nutrition can be improved simply at first by prescribing needed additions to diet rather than imposing restrictions. Vitamin deficiency may by itself be the cause of neurosis or more serious mental disease, whereas psychic stress by itself may create a need for additional vitamin intake. Hormone therapy may be extremely helpful but must be based on clear indication and limited to specific purposes. Since lack of sleep and rest quickly impairs mental function, it is important for neurotic persons to learn relaxation as a necessity for sleep. Sedatives may be used in a crisis but should be abandoned as soon as possible. With all drugs there are problems of excess and habituation. The least, the mildest, the shortest dosage is the ideal. THE INITIAL STEPS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANY PHYSICIAN: Establishing rapport, noting how complaints are stated, encouraging ventilation, winning confidence rather than immediate results.",

      "title": "Promoting Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis: A Novel Strategy for Antidepressant Drug Screening",
      "abstract": "Major depression is a common mood disorder that affects overall health; currently, almost all of the available antidepressants have the same core mechanisms of action through promotion of serotonin or noradrenaline function in the brain. The major limitation of today's antidepressants is that chronic treatment (3 - 6 weeks) is required before a therapeutic benefit is achieved. More effective and faster treatments for depression are needed. Adult neurogenesis is the birth of new neurons, which continues postnatally and into adulthood in the brains of multiple species, including humans. Recently, a large body of evidence gives rise to the hypothesis that the antidepressant effect and increases in adult hippocampal neurogenesis may be causally related. Multiple classes of antidepressants increase hippocampal neurogenesis in a chronic, but not acute, time course. This effect corresponds to the therapeutic time lag associated with current antidepressants. In addition, antidepressants are not effective in behavioral models of depression when hippocampal neurogenesis is prevented. This review examines the current understanding of adult neurogenesis and the evidence of the causal relationship between antidepressant effects and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. We also present our recent research findings, which support a promising strategy for enhancing adult hippocampal neurogenesis that might be a new approach for the development of novel antidepressants.

      "title": "Prolonged coma after anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Anesthesiologists are pretty much the only doctors who induce controlled and reversible coma medically in their daily practice. The word “coma” derived from a Greek word “Koma” signifies a state of sleep. In medical terms it is defined as a state of unresponsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused.[1] Therefore any delayed recovery is viewed as anesthetic problem. Delayed recovery from anesthesia or coma after anesthesia is a major anesthetic complication. The causes for delayed recovery from anesthesia are many. They are patient, surgical, anesthetic, and pharmacological factors. The pharmacological factors include the use of various anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and their interactions with other drugs, known or unknown. This depends upon the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, context sensitive half-lives, amount of drug administered, accidental administration, co-administration with other drugs etc. The patient factors such as the extremes of age, obesity, and various co-morbidities like the cardiovascular, renal, liver or other major organ dysfunction can potentiate the effects of the drug used. Some of the rare causes are myxoedema coma, drug toxicity and Addison's disease. However the delayed recovery due to anesthetic causes, excluding hypoxia, usually lasts for a few hours to days.[1] In the case report published in this issue, the coma lasted for >4 weeks. The authors have eliminated most of the causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia. However the hypoglycemia was detected in the postoperative period when the patient did not recover from anesthesia. The history obtained later revealed that the patient had taken long acting insulin in the preoperative period. The blood sugar level on the morning of surgery was borderline. No blood sugar was estimated during the entire surgical procedure. These factors could have led to profound and prolonged undetected hypoglycemia, which could have led to delayed recovery. Hypoglycemia of prolonged duration (>30 min) leads to neuroglycopenia and brain damage.[2] The symptoms depend on level of blood glucose and also on time taken to detect and correct hypoglycemia. Even after correcting hypoglycemia, prolonged coma is observed in critical care units. It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects, but the principal problem arising from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain is impairment of function (neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from mild dysphoria to more serious issues such as seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage and death.[3] Plasma glucose levels are maintained between 4 and 8 mmol/L (72–144 mg/dl) throughout the 24 hours. 3.3-3.9 mmol/L (60-70 mg/dl) is cited as lower limit of blood glucose. However hypoglycemic symptoms do not occur till 2.8-3.0 mmol/L (50-54 mg/dl) of plasma glucose. Under anesthesia hypoglycemic symptoms are not detected. In the case presented the blood glucose level 5 h after preoperative value was 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dl). To detect hypoglycemia causing brain damage electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion-weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful, both in detection and prognostication. EEG shows theta waves and lambda waves with definite slowing, flat and burst suppression patterns. In this case the EEG changes observed point to hypoglycemia as the factor leading to delayed recovery. There have been reports of hyper-intense signal intensities in diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in hypoglycemia.[4] Recently different patterns of DW MRI findings involving the internal capsules, corona radiata and frontoparietal cortex in a patient who recovered from prolonged hypoglycemic coma without neurological deficit have been observed. Therefore, this particular modality might have been useful in diagnosis and prognostication.[5] Volatile anesthetics have been found to produce neuroprotection in various paradigms. The preconditioning by these agents partially protects perirhinal cortex and striatal dependent functions against moderate to severe neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.[6] Although previous morphological data have suggested that cells die by necrosis, experimental research showed neuronal damage after hypoglycemia has features of apoptosis.[7] After exclusion of organic and pharmacological causes, coma may be attributed to a dissociative stupor. Reported delays in return to consciousness span time periods from 2 to 30 h, and longer periods of amnesia thereafter. There are four reports in the literature; each excluded other pathology with extensive examination, laboratory tests and radiological imaging. One individual experienced this phenomenon on three separate occasions after tracheal stenosis repairs.[89] Conclusion Delayed recovery is usually multifactorial. In the present case report, it looks more like prolonged hypoglycemia leading to delayed recovery. A differential diagnosis of dissociative stupor can be considered when other causes are excluded. The lesson one has to learn as a perioperative physician is to assess the patient thoroughly and investigate according to the need and evidence. An arterial blood gas and blood sugar estimation are needed in prolonged surgeries with multiple co-morbidities particularly in obese individuals.

Regardless of sensory modality, disorders of the special senses in the elderly can be conveniently divided into conductive, sensorineural, and central disorders. Disorders of the chemosensory senses, smell and taste, are usually less disabling than disorders of the other special senses (vision and hearing). Nevertheless, olfactory impairment is a significant contributor to perceived disability and lower quality of life among elderly patients and is a significant predictor of subsequent cognitive decline. Gustatory disorders in the elderly that are not secondary to olfactory disorders should prompt consideration of systemic factors, such as medication use, toxin exposures and autoimmune disorders.",

      "title": "54 and Sleep Disorders",
      "abstract": "resilience, and engagement in life well into old age. The preservation of excellent-quality sleep into later life not only tells us how someone is actually doing but is also important with respect to continued successful adapta­ tion along both physical and psychosocial dimensions. 4•5 Second, sleep disorders are common in older adults (who take approximately 40% of prescribed sedative hypnotics in the United States) and, if recognized and diagnosed by chief complaints of or excessive sleepiness at inappropriate times of day, can usually be successfully treated or at least mitigated with respect to their adverse impact on the patient's quality of life and on caregiver strain and burden. (The latter consideration is particu­ larly important in the case of the frail elder on the cusp of long-term care placement, since sleep disturbance in the caregiver related to the patient's disruptive nocturnal behaviors may lead to institutionalization.) Even among patients in long-term care placement, including those with progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia of the Alzheimer type, sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are frequently amenable to effective intervention. Finally, the risk of not recognizing and ap­ propriately treating sleep disorders in later life needs to be understood. These risks include deterioration in the quality of life, the development of emotional problems such as depression, worsening of cognitive impairment, and complications of sleep disorders such as motor ve­ hicle accidents. Risk for mortality, also, may be adversely affected by too much sleep (i.e., greater than nine hours out of 24), possibly mediated by sleep apnea, or too little sleep (i.e., less than five hours out of 24) in late life, as epidemiologic data have shown.6 Thus, not only does the quality of sleep affect the quality of life, but also sleep can be, literally, a matter of life and death. Within this context, therefore, this chapter discusses the expected changes of sleep that occur in the elderly and addresses the issue of whether it is usual to sleep less or more as one ages. We will also discuss a definition of insomnia in the elderly, together with the key items in the history in the workup of the elderly individual who complains of insomnia. Indications for referral for formal sleep studies will be reviewed. We will discuss practical, nonpharmacologic approaches to the management of chronic in later life, as well as the role of psychoactive medications in the management of acute and chronic insomnia: Is there a benzodiazepine of choice? Does diphenhydramine have a role? What is the place of zolpidem? Common causes of excessive daytime sleepiness in the elderly, including sleep apnea, nar­ colepsy, and periodic limb movement disorder will be reviewed along with their treatment. Parasomnias, which commonly affect the elderly, are also reviewed. We will also consider the contexts of care, e.g., outpatient, home, and long-term care, where appropriate. This latter focus will include a summary of what is known about the changes of sleep that accompany dementing disorders, a discussion of when intervention is needed, and what in­ terventions are likely to be useful. Finally, we will incor­ porate our view of current research directions in this area, including a focus on what is known about the neural basis of sleep and its changes with aging. To enhance the clinical relevance of this chapter, we will conclude with a discussion of office-based screening and present illustra­ tive case studies.",

      "abstract": "Analgesia is defined as loss of pain sensation without loss of consciousness; pain may be acute or chronic. Acute pain is well understood and can be controlled with currently available analgesics. Chronic pain, however, is not effectively controlled with current analgesics and side effect profiles often limit the use of these agents. Currently there are: (i) no objective methods for defining pain or analgesia in humans; (ii) no objective methods for correlating efficacy of analgesics in animal testing with human testing; and (iii) no objective method of evaluating the efficacy of analgesics in painful conditions, including neuropathic pain in which adaptive or maladaptive changes evolve with time. A technological revolution in functional brain imaging in humans and animals offers new approaches to objective evaluation of analgesics and of clinical pain states. These approaches hold great promise for revolutionizing drug development at preclinical and clinical stages.",

      "title": "POSSIBLE PREDICTORS OF VASCULAR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT–NO DEMENTIA",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The term “predementia syndrome” identifies all conditions with age-related deficits in cognitive function reported in the literature, including a mild stage of cognitive impairment based on a normality model and pathological conditions considered predictive or early stages of dementia.1,2 Such predementia syndromes have been defined for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but have not yet been operationalized for vascular dementia (VaD) and other specific forms of dementia. Therefore, the term “predementia syndromes” includes different conditions, and of these predementia syndromes, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the most widely used term to indicate older persons without dementia with no significant disability and mild memory or cognitive impairment that cannot be accounted for by any recognized medical or psychiatric condition.1,2 Predementia syndrome is, therefore, an umbrella term that includes also the preclinical phase of dementia of numerous rating scales developed for staging dementia (i.e., Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale score of 0.5 or “questionable dementia”).1 There is now ample evidence that MCI is often a pathology-based condition with a high rate of progression to AD.1,2 Therefore, MCI, and particularly amnestic MCI (aMCI) was also identified as the predementia syndrome for AD. The more recently proposed multiple subtypes of MCI were intended to reflect the heterogeneity of different types of dementia. Actually, the recent subclassification of MCI according to its cognitive features (dysexecutive MCI and aMCI or aMCI and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI): single domain aMCI and multiple domain aMCI or single domain naMCI, and multiple domain naMCI), clinical presentation (MCI with parkinsonism, or cerebrovascular disease (CVD), or depressive symptoms, or behavioral and psychological symptoms) or likely etiology (MCI-AD, vascular MCI, or MCI-Lewy body dementia) represents an attempt to control this heterogeneity.1,2 In particular, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a heterogeneous group of cognitive disorders that share a presumed vascular cause.3 In 2003, it was hypothesized that people with VCI have a specific cognitive profile in which memory is preserved and executive function impaired.4 Within the VCI construct, the parallel condition to MCI is VCI–no dementia (VCI-ND) or vascular predementia MCI, defined as the clinical phenotype of cognitive impairment of a presumed vascular cause that is not severe enough to meet the criteria for dementia.3 NaMCI can, in some cases, be vascular in origin, and other subtypes of MCI can progress to VCI.3 The Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) found that, in elderly people with VCI-ND, low scores on tests of memory and semantic category fluency predicted incident cases of dementia (VaD and AD combined) 5 years later. Most of these incident cases had VaD.5 Other groups have also shown that reductions in memory, as part of a more global pattern of impairment, precede diagnoses of VaD and AD by up to 4 years.3,6 In the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA), in 2,963 individuals from a population-based sample, it was found that, in a predementia syndrome with a cognitive pattern similar to AD and with a central role for memory decline (aMCI), in those who progressed to dementia, 60% progressed to AD and 33% to VaD or VCI.6 Recently, in the CSHA, in people with no cognitive impairment at baseline, abstract reasoning was considerably worse in those who developed VCI than in those who developed AD and had memory impairment.7 These results suggest the existence of a preclinical phase of VCI (VCI-ND) during which widespread but subtle executive dysfunction plus memory impairment may be detected some years before a clinical diagnosis can be rendered. Beyond controlling the established vascular risk factors for stroke, prevention of VCI-ND might be possible through physical activity.8 In another recent community-based study, the Fremantle Diabetes Study (FDS), involving 205 older subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 75.3), 164 subjects with normal cognition (CDR=0) and 41 with cognitive impairment without dementia or “questionable dementia” (CDR=0.5), after 1.6 years of follow-up, 33 (16.1%) had experienced cognitive decline. After controlling for age, education, and cognitive function, cognitive decline was predicted by urinary albumin excretion rates, whereas the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) appeared protective.9 The authors correctly acknowledged that blood pressure lowering has been shown to be effective in preventing stroke-related dementia (i.e., VCI), but the data on AD are conflicting,10 although the possible protective effect of ACEIs or ARBs may occur independently of blood pressure lowering. Given this evidence and the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the whole FDS sample, it seems reasonable to postulate that the cognitive impairment without dementia identified with a CDR of 0.5 may be particularly due to vascular pathology (VCI-ND). In conclusion, we strongly suggest a vascular origin for the cognitive impairment without dementia predicted by microalbuminuria and ACEIs or ARBs in the FDS, with a clinical phenotype compatible with VCI-NA. These findings suggest new possible predictors of VCI-ND, beyond reported executive dysfunction plus memory impairment and physical activity.7,8 Conflict of Interest: The editor in chief has reviewed the conflict of interest checklist provided by the authors and has determined that the authors have no financial or any other kind of personal conflicts with this letter.

      "title": "Understanding Neuropathic Pain",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neuropathic pain is defined as a chronic pain condition that occurs or persists after a primary lesion or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system. Traumatic injury of peripheral nerves also increases the excitability of nociceptors in and around nerve trunks and involves components released from nerve terminals (neurogenic inflammation) and immunological and vascular components from cells resident within or recruited into the affected area. Action potentials generated in nociceptors and injured nerve fibers release excitatory neurotransmitters at their synaptic terminals such as L-glutamate and substance P and trigger cellular events in the central nervous system that extend over different time frames. Short-term alterations of neuronal excitability, reflected for example in rapid changes of neuronal discharge activity, are sensitive to conventional analgesics, and do not commonly involve alterations in activity-dependent gene expression. Novel compounds and new regimens for drug treatment to influence activity-dependent long-term changes in pain transducing and suppressive systems (pain matrix) are emerging.",

Descriptions of the symptoms, as we have described throughout this book, and as spelled out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), serve as the point of departure—symptoms that are not just fleeting, but recurrent or persistent. The symptoms must also not be occurring exclusively and only in the context of some other condition, be it psychiatric, medical, or related to substance use. If, for example, the depersonalization happened only when the person was deeply depressed, or during a panic attack, or a seizure, or because a person has a brain tumor, he or she would not be diagnosed as having DPD. Likewise, regular substance users (daily drinkers or marijuana users) who experience depersonalization only in that context would not be diagnosed with DPD.",

Sleep disorders result from multiple factors--including pharmacologic, physiologic, biologic, and behavioral--and can be mildly debilitating or life-threatening. Diagnosis includes consideration of the presence of physical or mental illness, drug and/or alcohol use or abuse, a primary sleep disorder such as sleep-disordered breathing or periodic limb movements during sleep, changes in circadian rhythms, or poor sleep hygiene. Despite a high rate of use, hypnotics are best suited for periodic rather than chronic sleep disorder symptoms and, in general, should be used only after adjustments in sleep hygiene prove unsuccessful as first-line therapy.",

Its treatment must be individualized and based on the etiology of the psychomotor disturbance. Certain categories of drugs are broadly effective. Sedation and control of disruptive and dangerous behavior are the initial goals in stabilizing acutely agitated patients. Sedation is necessary during the lag period before antipsychotic and mood‐stabilizing drugs take effect. Barbiturates and chlorpromazine, initially given to control agitated behavior, are largely supplanted by higher‐potency antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and, recently, a combination of these two agents. Agitation is generally controlled within hours to days, whereas remission of affective or psychotic symptoms often requires weeks to months. Once remission is obtained, sedation is no longer desired and may be a barrier to optimal patient function and compliance. Thus, for long‐term treatment, strategies are used to minimize sedation, such as reducing dosages, changing administration to bedtime, or adding antidepressants or stimulants where appropriate.",

      "title": "The nature of neuroendocrine abnormalities in depression: a controversial issue in contemporary psychiatry.",
      "abstract": "Neuroendocrine abnormalities in depression have been regarded, by many authors, as relatively specific markers of nosological subtypes of the disorder, e.g. primary vs. secondary, endogenous vs. non-endogenous or unipolar vs. bipolar depression. They should reflect the same changes in central neurotransmitters (e.g. noradrenergic insufficiency and/or cholinergic hyperactivity) that were hypothesized as the cause of clinical symptoms. This view is challenged on the basis of our own neuroendocrine investigations in 317 psychiatric patients and 103 normal controls. According to these studies the abnormalities are nosologically rather unspecific. They are induced by a large variety of factors, e.g. emotional stress associated with the clinical symptomatology, weight loss due to malnutrition as a consequence of reduced appetite, medication and drug withdrawal. Stress-induced hypercortisolism appears to be the most common abnormality that may trigger other neuroendocrine dysfunctions, such as a blunted TSH response to TRH. Differences in neuroendocrine abnormalities of depressives are probably due to variations in the manifold factors influencing the hormonal axes involved, to temporal changes in hormonal patterns (e.g. one abnormality triggering another) and to individual differences in the basic activity and the responsiveness of the various axes.",

      "title": "Psychosis: impact on the patient and family.",
      "abstract": "Psychosis represents a milestone in the progression of PD, often severely taxing caregivers and frequently warranting nursing-home placement. This step is often necessary because caregivers cannot tolerate, among other stressors, their loved ones' sexual aberrations and irrational accusations (which can be caused by paranoid ideation). Other salient features of parkinsonian psychosis comprise vivid nightmares, which often herald its onset; hallucinations, which are principally visual and stereotypical in content; agitation; aggression; delirium; and confusion that exceeds the typical erosion in mentation. Hallucinosis and paranoid ideation may in turn precipitate weight loss; food may be deemed inedible because of imagined contaminants, for instance, either worm infestations or a delusional fear of poisoning by the caregiver. Parkinsonian psychosis exhibits an age predilection; correlates with the duration of disease and levodopa therapy; and may be associated with increases in the dosage of this agent or other drugs given, either as monotherapy or with levodopa. Levodopa or dopamine agonist toxicity can lead to psychosis because of dopaminergic hypersensitivity. Unfortunately, attempts to diminish this untoward effect (eg, reducing the levodopa dosage, introducing neuroleptics) may curb the psychosis but also erode control of parkinsonian features. To avert this \"dopamine dilemma,\" we have tested a selective serotonin antagonist (ondansetron), which essentially attenuated visual hallucinosis, improved delusional ideation and confusion, and was well tolerated. Other agents that can be tried for parkinsonian psychosis include the atypical neuroleptics olanzapine and clozapine.",

      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "abstract": "La toxicité cérébrale du cannabis est marquée principalement par des effets cognitifs, addictifs et psychotomimétiques. Troubles cognitifs Plusieurs études ont montré que l’administration aiguë de Δ-9-THC, principal principe actif du cannabis, et que la consommation régulière de cannabis entraînaient des troubles de l’attention, de la mémoire, en particulier de la mémoire de travail et de la mémoire épisodique ainsi que des troubles des fonctions exécutives. Ces troubles ont un impact sur l’apprentissage, les acquisitions scolaires, la conduite d’un véhicule et les tâches complexes. Ils sont liés à la dose, à la fréquence, à la durée d’exposition et à l’âge de la première consommation. Ils peuvent disparaître après sevrage, mais des anomalies durables s’observent chez les sujets ayant débuté leur consommation avant l’âge de 15 ans. Effets addictifs La fréquence sur la vie entière de la dépendance au cannabis, caractérisée essentiellement par le craving , la perte de contrôle de la consommation et le retentissement important sur la vie familiale/professionnelle/sociale est, d’après certaines études, de 1 % en population générale. Le syndrome de sevrage, décrit en 2004, pourrait être inclus dans le DSM-5. Effets psychotomimétiques Fréquents, les symptômes psychotiques induits par la consommation de cannabis (idées de référence, de persécution) disparaissent spontanément dans les 24 heures. Ils durent parfois plusieurs semaines dans les pharmacopsychoses. Neuf études longitudinales ont montré que les sujets qui avaient fumé du cannabis avaient deux fois plus de risque environ que les sujets abstinents, de présenter ultérieurement des troubles psychotiques. Le risque, dose-dépendant, est plus élevé lorsque la consommation de cannabis a débuté avant l’âge de 15 ans et chez les sujets qui ont des antécédents familiaux de troubles psychotiques. L’évolution de la schizophrénie est aggravée par la consommation de cannabis. Toxicité cérébrale du cannabis Elle est liée à l’interaction du Δ-9-THC sur les récepteurs cannabinoïdes cérébraux CB1, localisés principalement dans l’hippocampe, le cervelet, le cortex frontal, le striatum et les ganglions de la base. Plusieurs études ont retrouvé que la consommation de cannabis pouvait interférer avec le système endocannabinoïde cérébral lors de la maturation du cerveau à l’adolescence. Elle favorise aussi des troubles vasculaires cérébraux. Les études d’imagerie cérébrale ont retrouvé que les effets du cannabis, modérés en cas d’usage simple, étaient marqués chez les consommateurs réguliers par une diminution dose-dépendante de la densité de substance grise au niveau de l’hippocampe, des régions parahippocampiques et de l’amygdale.",

Symptoms commonly include hallucinations, mostly of the auditory type, and affective disturbances, in a background of clear consciousness. In this case series, four subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption were evaluated for hallucinatory symptoms after chronic alcohol intake. All of them had auditory hallucinations, with an anxious affect and no cognitive deficits. Only one case had visual hallucinations. The psychotic symptoms in all the patients were completely remitted with antipsychotics. Resumption of alcohol consumption increases the risk of relapse. The pathophysiology of alcoholic hallucinosis is not yet established and needs to be studied further for better diagnosis and management.",

It is a rare idiosyncratic reaction to major tranquilizers, including the phenothiazines, butyrophenones, and thioxanthenes; haloperidol and fluphenazine enanthate or fluphenazine decanoate are the drugs most commonly incriminated. The syndrome occurs after therapeutic rather than toxic doses of neuroleptic drugs and is unrelated to the duration of therapy. The NMS is attributed to a disturbance of dopaminergic systems within the basal ganglia and hypothalamus. Associated laboratory abnormalities include leukocytosis, with elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and liver enzyme concentrations. The NMS, which is known to some psychiatrists and neurologists but to few internists, probably is underdiagnosed; therefore, its true incidence is unknown. The NMS should be included in the differential diagnosis of any febrile patient with a history of neuroleptic treatment. Because the mortality of NMS is about 20%, early diagnosis and withdrawal of the neuroleptic drug therapy is crucial. Supportive treatment in a medical intensive care unit may be required.

      "title": "Neuroinflammation and status epilepticus: a narrative review unraveling a complex interplay",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency resulting from the failure of the mechanisms involved in seizure termination or from the initiation of pathways involved in abnormally prolonged seizures, potentially leading to long-term consequences, including neuronal death and impaired neuronal networks. It can eventually evolve to refractory status epilepticus (RSE), in which the administration of a benzodiazepine and another anti-seizure medications (ASMs) had been ineffective, and super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), which persists for more than 24 h after the administration of general anesthesia. Objective of the present review is to highlight the link between inflammation and SE. Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown that neuroinflammation can contribute to seizure onset and recurrence by increasing neuronal excitability. Notably, microglia and astrocytes can promote neuroinflammation and seizure susceptibility. In fact, inflammatory mediators released by glial cells might enhance neuronal excitation and cause drug resistance and seizure recurrence. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation could be crucial for improving SE treatment, wich is currently mainly addressed with benzodiazepines and eventually phenytoin, valproic acid, or levetiracetam. IL-1β signal blockade with Anakinra has shown promising results in avoiding seizure recurrence and generalization in inflammatory refractory epilepsy. Inhibiting the IL-1β converting enzyme (ICE)/caspase-1 is also being investigated as a possible target for managing drug-resistant epilepsies. Targeting the ATP-P2X7R signal, which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and triggers inflammatory molecule release, is another avenue of research. Interestingly, astaxanthin has shown promise in attenuating neuroinflammation in SE by inhibiting the ATP-P2X7R signal. Furthermore, IL-6 blockade using tocilizumab has been effective in RSE and in reducing seizures in patients with febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES). Other potential approaches include the ketogenic diet, which may modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and the use of cannabidiol (CBD), which has demonstrated antiepileptic, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties, and targeting HMGB1-TLR4 axis. Clinical experience with anti-cytokine agents such as Anakinra and Tocilizumab in SE is currently limited, although promising. Nonetheless, Etanercept and Rituximab have shown efficacy only in specific etiologies of SE, such as autoimmune encephalitis. Overall, targeting inflammatory pathways and cytokines shows potential as an innovative therapeutic option for drug-resistant epilepsies and SE, providing the chance of directly addressing its underlying mechanisms, rather than solely focusing on symptom control.",

      "abstract": "In Reply . —Dr Jenkins has touched on an important and challenging problem that both researchers and clinicians face in diagnosing serious depression in medical inpatients. Are symptoms of depression due to organic illness and thus likely to respond to treatment of the underlying physical illness, or, on the other hand, are they of psychological origin and thus require counseling or antidepressant therapy? This difficulty, in part, arises from a lack of distinction between depressive symptoms and depressive disorder. Fleeting depressive symptoms (such as decreased energy, difficulty sleeping) are quite common among acutely ill medical patients (in or outside of the Veterans Administration system); however, such symptoms are often different in intensity and duration from those that comprise a major depressive disorder. The latter (by DSM-III-R criteria) requires a depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day for 2 weeks or longer, and the simultaneous presence of a constellation of",

The need to modify the treatment protocols when neurotoxicity appears is not fully established.

Most authors recognize two types of NCSE depending on the ictal electroencephalographic changes: generalized (absence status epilepticus) and complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). In addition, there is also a simple form of partial status which is likely underdiagnosed because of its frequent progression to CPSE, subtle and varied symptomatology and high proportion of normal electroencephalograms (EEG). Absence status epilepticus (ASE) may occur in different clinical situations including idiopathic generalized epilepsy (typical AS), symptomatic generalized epilepsy (atypical AS), and elderly subjects without antecedents of epilepsy on chronic treatment with psychotropic drugs (de novo AS of late onset). Furthermore, CPSE is more frequent than previously mentioned. Although initially was equated with temporal lobe status epilepticus, extratemporal cases of CPSE have been well-documented, and the electroclinical characteristics of two types (I and II) of frontal CPSE have been recently described. NCSE may occur in patients with diverse clinical diagnosis such as hypoxic-anoxic encephalopathy, cancer, drugs, autoimmune disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, chromosomal alterations, peritoneal dialysis, infections, cerebral hamartomas or head trauma.The identification of NCSE may be particularly arduous and, therefore, a high level of suspicion is essential to obtain an early diagnosis. An urgent EEG with administration of intravenous benzodiazepines is considered as the method of choice in the diagnostic evaluation of NCSE.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

A sound selection matches the drug's characteristics with the patient's needs. Transient insomnias must be differentiated from persistent insomnias, which are more resistant to treatment.

Examination should include neurologic and mental status components and should be as thorough as possible. Ancillary testing should be strategic and address specific problems in the differential diagnosis. Appropriate referrals to other medical disciplines should be promptly arranged, with engagement of the primary care provider. The caregiver is often a hidden patient.

      "abstract": "In many alcoholics, the severity of withdrawal symptoms increases after repeated withdrawal episodes. This exacerbation may be attributable to a kindling process. Kindling is a phenomenon in which a weak electrical or chemical stimulus, which initially causes no overt behavioral responses, results in the appearance of behavioral effects, such as seizures, when it is administered repeatedly. Both clinical and experimental evidence support the existence of a kindling mechanism during alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures, result from neurochemical imbalances in the brain of alcoholics who suddenly reduce or cease alcohol consumption. These imbalances may be exacerbated after repeated withdrawal experiences. The existence of kindling during withdrawal suggests that even patients experiencing mild withdrawal should be treated aggressively to prevent the increase in severity of subsequent withdrawal episodes. Kindling also may contribute to a patient's relapse risk and to alcohol-related brain damage and cognitive impairment.",

Insomnia is classified as idiopathic or comorbid. Comorbid insomnias are associated with psychiatric disorders, medical disorders, substance abuse, and specific sleep disorders. Idiopathic insomnia is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion. A wide array of terminology exists for defining the duration of insomnia symptoms, which may add to the confusion regarding insomnia classification. Acute insomnia refers to sleep problems lasting from one night to a few weeks, whereas chronic insomnia refers to sleep problems lasting at least three nights weekly for at least one month. Diagnostic tools for identifying insomnia are multifactorial. Nonpharmacologic interventions for insomnia include sleep-hygiene education, stimulus-control therapy, relaxation therapy, and sleep-restriction therapy. The most effective pharmacologic therapies for insomnia are benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, melatonin-receptor agonists, and antidepressants. Choice of a specific agent should be based on patient-specific factors, including age, proposed length of treatment, primary sleep complaint, history of drug or alcohol abuse, and cost.Many treatment options are available for patients with insomnia. Behavioral therapies should be initiated as first-line treatment in most patients. For patients who require the addition of pharmacologic therapy, the drugs with the most evidence for benefit include benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, melatonin-receptor agonists, and antidepressants. Selection of a specific agent must take into account numerous patient-specific factors.",

Common daytime consequences experienced are fatigue, mood instability and impaired concentration. In chronic insomnia these symptoms persist over a period of at least three months. Chronic insomnia can also be a symptom of a variety of disorders. The pathophysiology of insomnia is theorised as a disorder of nocturnal and daytime hyper-arousal as a result of increased somatic, cortical and cognitive activation. The causes of insomnia can be categorized into situational, medical, psychiatric and pharmacologically-induced. To diagnose insomnia, it is required to evaluate the daytime and nocturnal symptoms, as well as psychiatric and medical history. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 Criteria (DSM-5) also provides guidelines and criteria to be followed when diagnosing insomnia disorder. Goals of treatment for insomnia disorder are to correct the underlying sleep complaint and this, together with insomnia symptoms, their severity and duration, as well as co-morbid disorders will determine the choice of treatment. In the majority of patients, insomnia can be treated without pharmacological therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy is considered first-line therapy for all patients with insomnia. The most common pharmacological insomnia treatments include benzodiazepines and benzodiazepines receptor agonists. To avoid tolerance and dependence, these hypnotics are recommended to be used at the lowest possible dose, intermittently and for the shortest duration possible. A combination of cognitive behavioural therapy and pharmacological treatment options is recommended for chronic insomnia.",

Patients frequently experience recurrent depressive episodes that are of longer duration and increased severity and which are less responsive to treatment than the index episode. Despite the highly prevalent nature of the illness, depression is frequently unrecognized and undertreated. Compliance with antidepressant medication is essential to consolidate treatment response and prevent relapse and recurrence. However, compliance with antidepressant medication is poor. Education of the patient and physician regarding the nature of depression and its treatment is essential for improving patient compliance. Although psychological mechanisms are a major factor affecting patient compliance, speed of onset of action and poor tolerability of antidepressant medication also have a considerable influence on patient compliance. The newer antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonselective serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are better tolerated than tricyclic antidepressants, possibly resulting in improved compliance and treatment outcome.",

Celem niniejszej pracy jest omówienie neurobiologicznych mechanizmów zaburzeń czynności poznawczych w powiązaniu z objawami klinicznymi oraz przedstawienie możliwości terapeutycznych u pacjentów z przetrwałymi dysfunkcjami poznawczymi w przebiegu zaburzeń depresyjnych.",

      "abstract": "Macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) is an emerging condition characterized by specific muscle lesions assessing abnormal long-term persistence of aluminum hydroxide within macrophages at the site of previous immunization. Affected patients usually are middle-aged adults, mainly presenting with diffuse arthromyalgias, chronic fatigue, and marked cognitive deficits, not related to pain, fatigue, or depression. Clinical features usually correspond to that observed in chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis. Representative features of MMF-associated cognitive dysfunction include dysexecutive syndrome, visual memory impairment, and left ear extinction at dichotic listening test. Most patients fulfill criteria for non-amnestic/dysexecutive mild cognitive impairment, even if some cognitive deficits appear unusually severe. Cognitive dysfunction seems stable over time despite marked fluctuations. Evoked potentials may show abnormalities in keeping with central nervous system involvement, with a neurophysiological pattern suggestive of demyelination. Brain perfusion SPECT shows a pattern of diffuse cortical and subcortical abnormalities, with hypoperfusions correlating with cognitive deficiencies. The combination of musculoskeletal pain, chronic fatigue, and cognitive disturbance generates chronic disability with possible social exclusion. Classical therapeutic approaches are usually unsatisfactory making patient care difficult.",

      "abstract": "A PATIENT has recovered from an anasthetic when consciousness has fully returned and any disability remaining is due to the surgical condition.Knowing the agent used and the length and depth of ana?sthesia maintained in a particular patient the time interval between withdrawal of the anaesthetic and recovery under standard conditions can be predicted with reasonable accuracy.This interval varies from several hours after prolonged etherisation to a few minutes following nitrous oxide anasthesia.Here it should be noted that if in the latter case pentothal has been used for induction and no nikethamide given post-operatively to counteract its influence, patients may sleep for several hours if the standard conditions allow of comfort and quiet ; such patients, however, can be awakened by ordinary stimuli.It is therefore disconcerting if after the expected time of recovery .onefinds the patient stuporous, and it is a matter of some urgency to diagnose the cause of the condition.This may be due to one or other of the well-recognised causes of coma, and although the anasthetic state may have initiated the process, the diagnosis and treatment are little influenced by the preceding anasthetic.Thus cerebral hamorrhage or thrombosis may follow upon profound disturbances of blood pressure in the arteriosclerotic patient undergoing operation ; an unrecognised diabetes mellitus may advance into deep ketosis ; in the tropics a latent infection may result in cerebral malaria after trauma', or the anasthetised, and perhaps also atropinised, patient may suffer from heatstroke during or immediately after operation.Severe shock with its associated tissue anoxia can result in such damage to the higher centres that their functions are impaired and unconsciousness supervene.Morphia given in relatively large or repeated doses to the shocked patient may give rise to dangerous morphinisation when the peripheral circulation improves.Such cases will not be considered here.Two further causes of post-anasthetic stupor must be reviewed.True coma may occur after an anasthetic in which anoxia has been present.Courville3 drew attention to this danger especially during nitrous oxide anasthesia, but he emphasised that it is the anoxia which is the causative factor and not the anathetic agent in use.Clearly defined cases in his series usually regained consciousness following the anoxic episode ; but often recovery was not complete, the brain was irreparably damaged and, possibly due to vasomotor instability, the destructive process continued.The patients died after a varying period.In less severe cases there may be recovery with residual symptoms suggestive of cortical or lenticular damage, Finally, there is the group of patients who show transitory emotiqnal or mental manifestations before recovering completely.Pathological",

      "title": "Leukodystrophy Overview – ARCHIVED CHAPTER, FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY",
      "abstract": "NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION IS ARCHIVED. IT IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. Clinical characteristics Leukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",

The disorder is common in neurological services and frequently seen by psychiatrists working in such settings. It is often associated with chronic severe disability. The diagnosis previously hinged on the neurologist’s demonstration of the lack of disease and the psychiatrist’s hypothesis of a ‘conversion’ of stress into a physical symptom. It is now based on positive findings on neurological assessment supplemented by a psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression disorders are common. Treatment is multi-disciplinary. Explanation of the condition to the patient is a crucial initial step supplemented, where necessary, by psychological treatment (especially for dissociative or non-epileptic attacks) and physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms.

      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> This case report of Transient Epileptic Amnesia (TEA) is presented due to the prolonged nature of the amnestic episodes, the significant delay to the correct diagnosis and the various diagnoses given to the patient in the meantime. <h3>Method</h3> Patient case presentation: Over a 34-month period a 62-year-old woman was seen in three different health settings before a correct diagnosis was provided. She experienced a total of nine episodes of transient amnesia (frequency: every 3–4 months; duration: 10 days; precipitant: stress and fatigue; occurrence: on waking from a “deep sleep”; precedent: gustatory hallucination; memory disturbance: partial anterograde amnesia, and retrograde amnesia for past events). Over the 3 years, she was given the following diagnoses by different clinicians of Transient Global Amnesia (TGA), Psychogenic Amnesia and then TEA. Following this, she received treatment with anti-epileptic drugs, which terminated any further episodes. <h3>Discussion</h3> Attacks usually last between 20 min to 60 min. However, in this case it was 10 days, which may be due to ongoing seizure activity or persistent post-ictal dysfunction of memory related brain structures. It took up to three times longer than the median time to diagnosis of 12 months for the correct diagnosis to be made. This may be due to the investigations being carried out inter-ictally, and the standard neuropsychological tests lacking sufficient sensitive to identify subtle memory disturbances. <h3>Conclusion</h3> The importance of correctly diagnosing the condition are: (1) Effective treatment. (2) Under-diagnosed. (3) Patients are always distressed by them, fearing the onset of dementia.",

Non-convulsive seizures represent states of various levels of altered awareness, associated with electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure activity, but without outwardly observable convulsive activity2.

      "title": "Alteraciones cognitivas y emocionales en el insomnio crónico",
      "abstract": "Little is known about the cognitive and emotional alterations associated with chronic insomnia.After reviewing the aetiology and pathophysiology of chronic insomnia, taking into account the patient's vulnerability and its inheritability, this study reports on the knowledge currently held about the cognitive deficits and emotional alterations observed in patients with chronic insomnia.Most aetiological models include factors that predispose an individual to insomnia, as well as precipitating and maintaining it. Predisposing factors can be of a biological or psychosocial nature. One predisposing factor that plays an important role is the vulnerability to insomnia, which is related to a non-adaptive way of coping with stress (focused on the emotion rather than on the problem) and the internalisation of negative emotions, which favours a state of physiological, cognitive and emotional hyperactivation that disrupts sleep and may lead to insomnia. This vulnerability is largely hereditary. Two phenotypes, based on the objective duration of sleep, have been described, the difference between them being the severity of the disorder. Insomniacs with an objective sleep time below six hours present significant cognitive deficits. These become manifest in tasks that require a large number of cognitive resources, complex attention tasks, changes in the focus of attention, the process of consolidation of memory during sleep, and working memory. These data suggest the existence of a prefrontal dysfunction. Comorbidity between insomnia and anxiety-depression is high. The anxiety-depression triggered by the internalisation of emotions predisposes the individual to insomnia and this, in turn, intensifies the depression.Alteraciones cognitivas y emocionales en el insomnio cronico.Introduccion. Las alteraciones cognitivas y emocionales asociadas al insomnio cronico son poco conocidas. Desarrollo. Tras revisar la etiologia y fisiopatologia del insomnio cronico, considerando la vulnerabilidad a este y su heredabilidad, se describe el estado actual de conocimientos acerca de los deficits cognitivos y las alteraciones emocionales observados en el insomnio cronico. Conclusiones. La mayoria de los modelos etiologicos incluye factores que predisponen al insomnio, que lo precipitan y que lo mantienen. Los factores predisponentes pueden ser de tipo biologico o psicosocial. Un factor predisponente que desempeña un importante papel es la vulnerabilidad al insomnio, que se relaciona con un modo no adaptativo de afrontar el estres (centrado en la emocion en vez de en el problema) y la internalizacion de las emociones negativas, lo cual favorece un estado de hiperactivacion fisiologica, cognitiva y emocional que altera el sueño y puede desembocar en insomnio. Esta vulnerabilidad es en gran parte hereditaria. Se han descrito dos fenotipos, basados en la duracion objetiva del sueño, que difieren en la gravedad del trastorno. Los insomnes con duracion objetiva del sueño menor de seis horas presentan deficits cognitivos significativos. Estos se manifiestan en tareas que requieren gran cantidad de recursos cognitivos, tareas de atencion complejas, cambio de foco de atencion, proceso de consolidacion de la memoria durante el sueño y memoria operativa. Estos datos sugieren la existencia de una disfuncion prefrontal. Se da una alta comorbilidad entre insomnio y ansiedad-depresion. La ansiedad-depresion provocada por la internalizacion de las emociones predispone al insomnio, y este, a su vez, intensifica la depresion.",

      "abstract": "El trastorno depresivo mayor es un desorden heterogéneo y multifactorial caracterizado por episodios de al menos dos semanas de duración, en los cuales se presente al menos uno de los dos síntomas centrales. Estos son: 1.- Estado de ánimo depresivo con pérdida de interés por las actividades cotidianas y 2.- Ausencia de la capacidad de sentir placer (anhedonia). Estos síntomas traen consigo trastornos anímicos, cognitivos y fisiológicos y en los casos más severos, pueden asociarse a conductas suicidas. Si bien en la actualidad la etiología del trastorno depresivo mayor es poco conocida, se ha reportado que tanto la presencia de neuroinflamación como la reducción de la neurogénesis hipocampal adulta son eventos claves en el desarrollo de esta patología. Las terapias actuales para el trastorno depresivo mayor no están enfocadas en estas alteraciones, lo que podría explicar el alto porcentaje de refractariedad al tratamiento de pacientes con trastorno depresivo mayor frente a la terapia convencional. Por este motivo, se ha propuesto como una opción de tratamiento el uso de células madre mesenquimáticas (MSC), las cuales son capaces de producir de manera paracrina, una gran variedad de moléculas terapéuticas entre las que se encuentran moléculas anti-inflamatorias y factores neuroprotectores inductores de la neurogénesis. Estas moléculas secretadas por las MSC se pueden recuperar desde el medio de cultivo celular y en conjunto reciben el nombre de secretoma. Este trabajo se basó en la evaluación del potencial antidepresivo de la administración intranasal repetida de secretoma derivado de MSC en un modelo animal de trastorno depresivo mayor instaurado en el bioterio de la Universidad del Desarrollo. En conjunto, los datos obtenidos muestran que el tratamiento intranasal con secretoma derivado de MSC fue capaz de revertir algunas de las conductas asociadas a estados depresivos en animales, disminuyendo significativamente el puntaje global de depresión en comparación a los animales tratados con vehículo. A nivel estructural el modelo animal de depresión utilizado no mostró presencia de alteraciones del proceso de neurogenesis hipocampal adulta pero sí mostró neuroinflamación, evidenciada en un aumento de la densidad de astrocitos a nivel del hipocampo en comparación a los animales control. Este aumento no se observó en los animales tratados con secretoma intranasal, sugiriendo un efecto anti-inflamatorio del biofármaco. Adicionalmente, se observó que el secretoma derivado de MSC ejerció un efecto protector sobre los astrocitos inhibiendo el proceso de atrofia de sus prolongaciones. Los datos pre-clínicos obtenidos sugieren que la administración intranasal de secretoma derivado de células madre mesenquimáticas representa un tratamiento potencialmente eficaz para reducir los síntomas de depresión en humanos y una posible alternativa terapéutica a los tratamientos actuales para esta devastadora patología",

      "abstract": "Chronic insomnia disorder is the most widely reported clinical condition in medicine. It has a significant impact on populations and is characterized by chronically disturbed sleep and sleep loss, non-refreshing sleep, and heightened arousal in bed. Poor sleep is associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes, and it is reported that poorer quality of life and medical, neurological, and psychiatric comorbidities disrupt sleep. Sleep difficulties may result from multiple etiologies; however, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying chronic insomnia disorder are not sufficiently understood. Recently, numerous neuroimaging studies have been conducted to investigate the structural or functional derangement in the brains of patients with chronic insomnia disorder. The development of neuroimaging techniques has provided insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms that make patients with chronic sleep disturbances vulnerable to cognitive impairment.

      "abstract": "Despite an initial sedative effect, alcohol disrupts sleep persistently and should not be used as a sleeping aid. Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

      "title": "[Neurobiology of alcohol withdrawal inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters].",
      "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal is a syndrome that is the result of adaptive changes in the brain secondary to chronic alcohol use and is associated with changes in many neurotransmitter, neuropeptide, and hormonal systems. Long-term exposure to ethanol leads to an imbalance in different excitatory (especially glutamate, a major excitatory amino acid), and inhibitory neurotransmitter (especially GABA, a major inhibitory amino acid) systems. When alcohol consumption is reduced or completely ceases, these imbalances are behaviorally expressed in the form of alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are mainly associated with the hypofunction of GABA receptors and enhanced function of NMDA receptors. The imbalance between receptors may be exacerbated by repeated withdrawal. Some of these alterations may last for months following alcohol cessation and cause symptoms of protracted alcohol withdrawal, which may contribute to the continuation of the cycle of alcohol addiction relapses. The search for biological alterations during alcohol withdrawal may not only render some important insights into the pathophysiology of alcohol dependence, but might also identify new targets for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and for preventing relapses following withdrawal. Therapists specializing in the treatment of addiction should be cognizant of the underlying biological mechanisms of alcohol withdrawal in order to more adequately understand the physiopathology of substance dependence in general. In this paper, we will review the changes in the inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter systems involved in alcohol withdrawal, and we will discuss their roles in the development of alcohol dependence.",

      "abstract": "Stroke survivors typically experience varying degrees of motor and neuropsychological deficits. Although these deficits are frequently treated as separate entities in the cognitive and physical rehabilitation settings, there is considerable interaction between them. Cognitive-motor interference, for example, refers to the simultaneous performance of cognitive and motor functions that results in diminished execution of one or both of the tasks. Studies have demonstrated that when performing dual tasks, poststroke patients will typically favor the cognitive function over the motor task. Furthermore, only certain cognitive functions will interfere with motor abilities, while the intensity of the motor task may magnify the detriment in dual-task performance. Moreover, mood disorders, particularly depression, have also been shown to interact substantially with physical functioning. Consequently, poststroke patients with depression experience greater reductions in their activities of daily living and worse rates of recovery. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest an association between white matter hyperintensities and both motor and neuropsychological poststroke deficits. The relationship between spasticity and cognition deficits needs to be further explored with regard to the deleterious consequences of poststroke spasticity on quality of life and overall motor function. These insights, among others, contribute to a growing, if embryonic, body of knowledge about poststroke motor/cognitive interaction that will ultimately inform developments in treatment and rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Neuroprotection: A New Strategy in the Treatment of Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Intervention in the progression of schizophrenia is an effort not just to deter psychosis but also to protect the brain from physiologic deterioration. Neurodegeneration is believed to result from neurochemical dysregulation during the onset of schizophrenia. Deterioration accrued over recurring psychotic episodes causes cumulative loss of cell processes, loss of gray matter volume, and apoptosis. Neurodegeneration ultimately results in persistent symptomology and functional impairment. Functional decline occurs early in the course of schizophrenia, and the symptoms that emerge during the prodromal stage may derail the normal adolescent neurodevelopment. Both first-episode psychosis and the prodrome may be opportunities to forestall neurodegeneration. Unfortunately, people with schizophrenia often experience a long duration of untreated psychosis. Treatment of first-episode psychosis with antipsychotic agents shows robust response. However, early-stage patients have very high rates of medication noncompliance. Treatment in the prodrome may offer the best chance to delay the onset of illness, mitigate its severity after onset, or even prevent onset of symptoms entirely. Nonpharmacologic treatments during the prodrome, such as education, treatment for substance use, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, are low-risk interventions that are potentially beneficial. Pharmacologic interventions during the prodrome are also effective in delaying onset of illness, but carry the risk of adversely affecting patients who are false positives for prodromal schizophrenia. In this Expert Roundtable Supplement, Jeffrey A. Lieberman, MD, provides an overview of the neurobiological basis of neurodegeneration and the concept of neuroprotection. Next, Peter F. Buckley, MD, reviews the importance of first-episode psychosis, including duration of untreated illness and medication adherence. Finally, Diana O. Perkins, MD, MPH, reviews treatment strategies for prodromal schizophrenia.",

Comorbidity of brain impairment, substance use, cognitive confusion or limitations, and mental illness are common. Assessment methodology that is based on legal realism must factor in the complications seen in cases of comorbidity. Cases involving brain impairment secondary to chronic substance use are complicated by the complex task of determining whether assessment results reflect fixed neurocognitive and behavioral deterioration related to chronic substance use or whether the deterioration might be reversible over time (the same is true of stroke outcomes). Brain impairment may contribute minimally or substantially to risk or deficits in parental functioning, but the impact must be legally relevant as defined by statutes governing care and protection regulations and termination statutes.",

The patient has been seizure-free and asymptomatic for more than 5 years after resection. There were no operative complications. The patient’s behavior and neurocognitive performance have improved markedly, and he is now employed and does not require supervision. Also, there has been a pronounced reduction in the adverse effects of antiepileptic drug medication. Partial or localization-related epilepsy is the most common seizure disorder. Approximately 90% of the adult incident cases of epilepsy have recurrent and unprovoked partial seizures. An estimated 20% of patients with epilepsy have an intractable seizure disorder, that is, pharmacoresistant seizures that are physically and socially disabling. Coexisting comorbid conditions associated with an intractable seizure disorder often include cognitive impairment, behavioral problems, psychosocial isolation, and the inability to operate a motor vehicle or to be gainfully employed. Patients with medically refractory seizures may also require a supervised living situation or caregiver. A prognostic indicator for an unfavorable response to antiepileptic drug therapy is the identification of a structural lesion as the cause of the seizure disorder. Potential alternative forms of therapy for patients with intractable epilepsy include the use of newer antiepileptic drug medications, surgical treatment, and vagus nerve stimulation.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder which occurs in a large number of people, it can have a lot of different causes. Short lasting (acute) insomnias are mostly results of stressful situations which a person experiences in his or hers life, and they usually end when the source of the stress is removed. Chronic insomias have different causes and they are frequently associated with psyhological problems. Treatment of insomnia, depending on the severity, cause and the individual patient, can be simple or very complicated. Acute insomnia usually doesn't require special therapy, or if therapy is needed it is not long lasting and usually it doesn't show severe complications with it's use. Chronic insomnia can have different causes and it's therapy is usually long lasting. Pharmacotherapeutic possibilities of insomia treatment are usually based on administration of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists (benzodiazepines and Z-drugs), but there are other options, such as antidepressants, ramelteon, melatonin, valerian, H1-antihistaminics and L-tryptophan. Benzodiazepine receptor antagonists show good results in shortening sleep onset latency, sleep duaration and sleep quality. Problems with the use of bendodiazepine receptor agonists are shown in daytime simptoms (fatigue, hangovers, restlessness) and the possibility of tolerance and dependence after longer use. Non pharmacological treatment are thought of as different methods of psyhological bihevioral therapy. The advantage here is that they show good results in shortening sleep onset latency, sleep duaration and sleep quality, and they are safe as a long term therapy option. The problem with this type of therapy is that it is expensive, it requiers specially trained experts and it doesn't show immediate results. Combined therapy has all the advantages of psyhological bihevioral therapy, with avoiding side effects which occure with pharmacological treatments. Alternative methods, such as acupuncture, acupressure, yoga and tay-chi are other methods of insomnia treatment, but there are not a lot of studies in this field, and the ones that have been made have inconsistent results. When choosing a therapy option, one should always have in mind that it can be long lasting, and therefore the individuality of each patient should get the most attention, so the best possible, but affordable option can be determined.",

The fact that in laboratory and clinical research only certain anesthetic agents and techniques, but not others, appear to be involved, raises the problem on what is the safest and the least safe anesthetic to maximize anesthesia efficiency, avoid occurrence of adverse events, and ensure patient safety. New trends in research are moving toward the theory that neuroinflammation could be the hallmark of, or could have a pivotal role in, several neurological disorders.",

      "title": "Depressive symptoms, anxiety and cognitive impairment: emerging evidence in multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neuropsychiatric abnormalities may be broadly divided in two categories: disorders of mood, affect, and behavior and abnormalities affecting cognition. Among these conditions, clinical depression, anxiety and neurocognitive disorders are the most common in multiple sclerosis (MS), with a substantial impact on patients’ quality of life and adherence to treatments. Such manifestations may occur from the earliest phases of the disease but become more frequent in MS patients with a progressive disease course and more severe clinical disability. Although the pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric manifestations has not been fully defined yet, brain structural and functional abnormalities, consistently observed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), together with genetic and immunologic factors, have been suggested to be key players. Even though the detrimental clinical impact of such manifestations in MS patients is a matter of crucial importance, at present, they are often overlooked in the clinical setting. Moreover, the efficacy of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches for their amelioration has been poorly investigated, with the majority of studies showing marginal or no beneficial effect of different therapeutic approaches, possibly due to the presence of multiple and heterogeneous underlying pathological mechanisms and intrinsic methodological limitations. A better evaluation of these manifestations in the clinical setting and improvements in the understanding of their pathophysiology may offer the potential to develop tools for differentiating these mechanisms in individual patients and ultimately provide a principled basis for treatment selection. This review provides an updated overview regarding the pathophysiology of the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in MS, the clinical and MRI characteristics that have been associated with mood disorders (i.e., depression and anxiety) and cognitive impairment, and the treatment approaches currently available or under investigation.",

Results Dyskinetic subjects presented more indirect indicators of occult brain damage, such as a perinatal event or traumatic brain injuries in infancy and early childhood; neurological examination showed more anomalies in dyskinetic patients than in non-dyskinetics, with a higher prevalence of facial release reflexes.

Mild cognitive impairment is a clinical state, sometimes prodromal to fully symptomatic AD, where cognitive deficit can be delineated by psychometric testing. AD pathogenesis is associated with progressive accumulation of a toxic and hydrophobic As peptide in the brain, which starts a number of years prior to the onset of clinical symptoms (yellow dotted line). This preclinical stage of the disease is dubbed the “brain AD stage”. Progressive accumulation of As in the brain results in a number of secondary pathological processes including neurofibrillary degeneration, inflammation, synaptic loss, and neuronal dropout, whose severity correlates with clinical symptoms of the disease (magenta dashed line).",

Supone la primera causa entre los pa- cientes que se suicidan a esta edad, genera gran sufrimiento en el propio paciente y en su familia, y es fuente de importante discapaci- dad por la propia enfermedad y por la reper- cusion en la evolucion de otras enfermedades comorbidas. Una vez diagnosticada y tratada, la evolucion de la enfermedad puede ser a una recuperacion completa del paciente, tan- to en lo sintomatico como en lo funcional. Sin embargo, es frecuente, en este periodo de la vida, que la enfermedad depresiva sea re- currente y que por tanto haya que mantener el tratamiento antidepresivo durante varios anos o de manera continuada. Tambien resul- ta habitual que algunos de los sintomas no respondan de la misma manera al tratamiento farmacologico o de psicoterapia. En este caso, pueden hacerlo mas tarde que los sintomas nucleares o quedar como sintomas residuales. Estos sintomas pueden tener tanta importan- cia y repercutir de tal manera en la vida de los pacientes que condicionen el pronostico de la enfermedad que padecen. Los sintomas cognitivos, la ansiedad y las alteraciones de los ritmos biologicos, sobre todo el sueno, son los que requieren una mayor atencion, pero las ideas de muerte y de suicidio, los sinto- mas somaticos y la apatia constituyen tam- bien sintomas para tener en cuenta.

It is the first cause among patients who commit suicide at this age, generates great suffering in the patients and in their family, and is a source of significant disability due to the disease itself and the impact on the evolution of other comorbid diseases. Once diagnosed and treated, the evolution of the disease can be to a complete recovery of the patient, symptomatic and functional recovery. Howe- ver, it is frequent, in this period of life, that the depressive illness would be recurrent and that therefore it would be necessary to main- tain the antidepressant treatment for several years or continuously. It is also common that some of the symptoms do not respond in the same way to the pharmacological treatment or psychotherapy. In this case, they can do it later than core symptoms do, or remain as residual symptoms. These symptoms can be so important and affect in such a way the life of the patients that condition the prognosis of the disease they suffer. Cognitive symp- toms, anxiety and alterations of biological rhythms, especially sleep, are those that re- quire more attention, but the ideas of death and suicide, somatic symptoms and apathy are also symptoms to be taken into account. Finally, some patients have resistant forms and do not respond to the treatment used, or they do it very partially. This article aims to review possible evolutions, to approach therapeutic harassment possibilities, and, finally, to examine some issues in the lives of these patients that could influence the coping of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Recreational intermittent, subthreshold amounts of alcohol and/or drugs might evoke chemical kindling of nonconvulsive, simple partial seizures in the limbic system, with secondary, brief, prefrontal lobe dysfunctioning; preserved core consciousness; and memory for the bizarre, out-of-character, motiveless, unplanned homicidal acts performed during a fleeting psychosis. Such acts persisted for 2 to l0 minutes despite forceful external interruption in three single, white male loners. In contrast, five nonusers, with otherwise similar symptomatology, aborted their homicidal attacks on external interruption, in a previously proposed syndrome with only experiential kindling with memory revival of past hurts in limbic psychotic trigger reaction. Thus, this article hypothesizes that either chemical kindling alone or as a superimposition on experiential kindling might occur in the form of unusual persistence or enhancement of partial seizures.",

In the more chronic, slowly progressive, or static conditions of encephalopathy, there may be retention of the attention initially with loss of cognitive capacity.Electroencephalography (EEG) is useful in evaluating patients with acute and chronic encephalopathies. The primary role is in differentiating the conditions associated with seizures. The various patterns detected with an EEG in encephalopathies are sensitive but usually not specific to a particular etiology. It is typically associated with a slowing of the cerebral activity and diffuse slow waveforms in the background. This could be secondary to the involvement of both the cortical neurons or the subcortical white matter dysfunction. Overall, EEG is useful for assessing the degree of cerebral dysfunction in encephalopathy and monitoring the changes along with clinical progression.",

      "abstract": "Objectives To review the reports of prolonged neuromuscular blockade secondary to vecuronium and atracurium administration. To propose mechanisms for prolonged blockade, as well as methods to avoid prolonged blockade. Data Sources A literature search was conducted of articles published from 1980 to 1993. Articles pertaining to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations, prolonged neuromuscular blockade, and continuous infusion administration of vecuronium and atracurium were obtained. Study Selection Studies and case reports pertaining to prolonged neuromuscular blockade in intensive care unit patients were reviewed and summarized. Data Extraction All articles were reviewed by both authors. Primarily, the critical care literature and anesthesia literature were reviewed. Case reports were divided into two groups, based on end-organ function and possible cause. Data Synthesis Prolonged neuromuscular blockade can be divided into two types. One is pharmacokinetically based, due to alterations in clearance and metabolite formation. The second occurs in patients without an etiology for drug clearance problems. Functional neuromuscular junction defects are the problem and may be due to the underlying disease state in addition to, or regardless of, the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Conclusions Controlled studies assessing the appropriate drug, administration method, use of drug in end-organ dysfunction, and monitoring techniques are unavailable. From the available case reports, length of neuromuscular blockade has been associated with endorgan dysfunction, concomitant drug use, severity of the underlying illness, length of therapy, monitoring techniques used, and perhaps method of drug administration. Steroidally based neuromuscular blocking agents may be particularly hazardous in patients receiving systemic corticosteroids. It is premature to determine the safety of one particular neuromuscular blocking drug in relation to another. Further studies are needed to optimize the use and safety of neuromuscular blocking agents in intensive care unit patients. (Crit Care Med 1994; 22:884–893)",

      "abstract": "In upper motor neuron diseases, like spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy and stroke, motor areas in the brain and/or spinal cord are damaged or fail to develop normally. Patients suffer from increased joint stiffness, diminished range of motion and flexion deformity. The underlying neural reflexive and non-neural tissue (i.e. muscle slack length and stiffness) contributors of these motor disorders cannot be distinguished by current clinical tests. This distinction of contributors is however important for treatment selection and to understand the mechanism of functional recovery. To quantify the neural and non-neural contributors, an instrumented electromyography driven non-linear neuromuscular modeling approach was developed, validated and applied in patients with stroke and cerebral palsy. The clinical potential of the modeling approach was illustrated by the development over time of neural and non-neural contributors in the sub-acute phase post-stroke and by the effect of botulinum toxin A treatment on these contributors in chronic stroke patients. The results from longitudinal assessments are a step forward in answering “when” to treat a stroke patient. The results also give direction to the question “how” to treat stroke patients, i.e. which treatment option is most effective in each individual patient. Both are a prerequisite for personalized treatment.",

      "abstract": "Key-words Disease name and synonyms Definition Abstract The syndrome of continuous spike and waves discharges during slow sleep (CSWSS) is a rare form of age-related epilepsy. Onset occurs between ages 3 and 7 years, and rarely before 2 years. In the absence of brain lesions, CSWSS syndrome occurs in normally developing children. Partial or generalized seizures are rare and occur while the child is falling asleep. Cognitive functions are subsequently altered and behavioural disorders are often seen. The initial neuropsychological deficits affecting a specific cognitive function such as language, gesture or constructive abilities, attention span or behaviour control are often wrongly attributed to psychological problems. The best known cognitive deficit is aphasia. Acquired epileptic aphasia, the Landau and Kleffner syndrome, has been named after the authors who described it in 1957. EEG anomalies are always present. During wakefulness, EEG recordings show focal paroxysmal spike and wave discharges. During slow sleep, spikes and waves become generalized and continuous, occupying over 85% of sleep. There are no concomitant motor seizures, but cognitive impairments progress. With antiepileptic drugs, the EEG becomes normal and neuropsychological status improves with antiepileptic drugs. Epileptic seizures always disappear with adolescence but neuropsychological sequelae may persist. There is no specific treatment with durable effects on the seizures and neuropsychological disorders. Management of CSWSS syndrome requires teams specialized in pediatric epilepsy and neuropsychology.",

      "abstract": "Several psychoactive drugs may induce addiction. Despite distinct pharmacological targets, all have the common property to stimulate the brain reward circuitry, which results in an increase of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. The stimulation induced by drugs of abuse is much more important in intensity and duration than the stimulation induced by natural rewards. The positive reinforcement resulting from this stimulation promotes repeated drug intake, which induces cellular and molecular adaptations in the brain reward circuit and other regions associated with this circuit. Enduring changes are more particularly observed in regions involved in pleasure, motivation, memory, conditioning, executive functions, judgement and self-control. A tolerance to the reinforcing effects of natural rewards is observed in parallel to a hypersensitivity to the motivational effects of drugs and drug-associated stimuli. Behaviour focuses more and more exclusively on drug research and drug consumption. Drug privation can induce a negative emotional state, withdrawal signs and craving which are key elements of relapse",

Poststroke dementia or post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSD/PSCI) is a form of cognitive disturbance caused by cerebrovascular disease that can manifest at different times after a stroke, including during the acute phase of stroke, during the recovery phase (while motor stroke symptoms improve), or months and years later. The onset of cognitive impairment depends on the location of infarct. Infarct in certain locations have cognitive impairment as a sole presentation from the outset. Infarcts in the left frontotemporal lobes, right parietal lobe, and left thalamus are notably correlated with cognitive impairment following a stroke. In the former, patients present with complains of motor difculties as the main complain. In addition to these locations, vascular lesions in the thalamo-perforating area of the PCAmay cause dementia and other forms of severe memory loss. Abaseline (pre-morbid) and early post-stroke (early post-morbid) cognitive status should be evaluated and a protocol for the same is needed in regular clinical and ICU care facilities. MoCA assessment is commonly used for cognitive assessment. Its role in strategic infarcts is undermined as it leaves out the evaluation of symptoms corresponding to common strategic infarct locations such as the medial temporal lobe and thalami. There is a need for dedicated neuropsychological assessment score based on education level, and native-language for PSCI.",

It is a developmental disorder of psychomotor skills that is manifested by impaired attention, motor hyperactivity and impulsivity. This disorder is characterized by early onset, the association of hyperactive and poorly coordinated behavior with marked inattention and lack of perseverance in performing tasks; and this behavior occurs in all situations and persists over time. This disorder is inappropriate for the child’s developmental age and maladaptive. Disorders of neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain with discrete neurological changes can lead to behavioral difficulties and other psychological problems. Most children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have comorbidities, often multiple comorbid conditions in the same person. Comorbidity was observed in both clinical and epidemiological samples. It is estimated that about two-thirds of children with this disorder have at least one other psychiatric disorder diagnosed. Symptoms persist and lead to significant difficulties in the daily functioning of the child, such as school success, social interactions, family and social functioning, etc. Recent studies indicate the presence of various neuroophthalmological disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD. The most common comorbidities in children and adolescents with ADHD that will be covered in this chapter are autism spectrum disorder, mood disorder, anxiety, learning disabilities, conduct disorders, tics disorder and epilepsy.",

Reappearance of seizures may be due to lack of protection and/or an abstinence syndrome. Seizures due to lack of protection occur following withdrawal of any antiepileptic drug when the epilepsy is not cured; they may not reappear for years (although over 80% occur within a year) and treatment then has to be restarted. They seem to be less frequent after withdrawal of carbamazepine or phenytoin than after withdrawing valproate, although the reason for this is not understood. Seizures due to an abstinence syndrome only occur after withdrawing benzodiazepines, phenobarbitone and primidone; they are seen in patients with both active and inactive epilepsy whilst the drug is being withdrawn and tend to be self-limiting. It is not necessary to reintroduce the drug when epilepsy is cured. Felbamate and vigabatrin cause seizures related to their withdrawal, but the mechanism of this is not clear. There is no scientifically established guideline for withdrawing antiepileptic drugs, but it is considered important to stop one at a time, starting with those which may cause abstinence syndromes, followed by the more toxic, less effective antiepileptic drugs, which cause more drug interactions and are more awkward to take.Further specific studies are necessary to establish the mechanisms of relapses and the scientific basis for withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs.",

This may be so severe as to necessitate complete custodial care indefinitely; it may be so slight, that a simple change in environment or program may allow for relatively normal community activity with minimal to no supervision. For these different degrees of disability a wide variety of terms have been used. In decreasing order of disability, the terms most frequently employed including their definitions in terms of intelligence quotients are as follows: 1. Borderline: I.Q. 70-80 2. Moron or high grade: I.Q. 50-70 3. Imbecile or middle grade: I.Q. 20-49 4. Idiot or low grade: I.Q. 0-19 Such terms as feeblemindedness and mental retardation are generally used interchangeably for mental deficiency. Obviously, not all children failing to adjust socially or follow normal paths of development are so because of basic mental deficiency. Certain other conditions, either superficially or strikingly resembling mental deficiency states, must be differentiated. These latter conditions require a different and sometimes highly specialized therapeutic approach and any considerable delay in their recognition may adversely affect subsequent adjustment. The most common of these conditions include the following which are briefly described: 1. Delay in Educational Maturation: There is considerable variation in the time at which children of normal intellectual capacity reach the stage at which they properly react to the usual educational procedures, normally introduced at about 6 years of age. This so-called period of \"educational readiness\", for want of a better term, includes many aspects such as attention span, personal relations and socialization status, and may occasionally be delayed 2 or 3 years.",

Many cognitive functions may be concerned and can be explained by fronto-striatal brain circuits and hippocampus dysfunctions partly through abnormalities related to cerebrovascular diseases. It seems important to distinguish between early and late onset depression whose cognitive characterisation and etiopathogenia differ in some aspects. Cognitive impairment may represent markers of depression but it is still unclear whether one should consider potential biomarkers of disease state or trait or risk factor. These disorders may precede depression and persist despite symptomatic remission. Moreover, the interest of specifying these disorders is multiple because they can have pejorative consequences such as the modification of emotional content, promote suicidal act, limit the effectiveness of psychotherapy, be a risk factor for poor response to antidepressants. or be a potential risk factor for progression to a minor or major neurocognitive disorder, especially Alzheimer's disease.",

Evidence from studies on the investigation of dementia and case reports of conditions traditionally held to cause reversible dementia (normal pressure hydrocephalus, vitamin B 12 deficiency, subdural haematoma) suggest that cortical dementia is not often a treatable syndrome. Acute or subacute confusional states and subcortical dementia are more typically associated with treatable or reversible causes of brain dysfunction. Diagnosis of these syndromes may identify those patients (especially those of advanced years) who should be extensively investigated.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND The neurologic disorder narcolepsy results from dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle and is primarily characterized by chronic, severely excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, an emotionally induced muscle weakness. The prevalence of narcolepsy is approximately 0.05%, and onset generally occurs during the first 2 decades of life. Narcolepsy is believed to be an autoimmune disorder with destruction of hypocretin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. OBJECTIVES To provide an enhanced understanding of narcolepsy and establish the need for early diagnosis and rapid initiation of effective treatment for patients with narcolepsy. DISCUSSION Narcolepsy reduces daily functioning and is associated with a substantial medical and economic burden, with many patients being on full disability. The annual direct medical costs are approximately 2-fold higher in patients with narcolepsy than in matched controls without this condition ($11,702 vs $5261, respectively; P <.0001). Further contributing to the overall burden is a lack of recognition of the signs and symptoms of narcolepsy and an absence of easily measurable biomarkers, resulting in a diagnostic delay that often exceeds 10 years and may be associated with misdiagnosis and inappropriate resource utilization. Because narcolepsy generally has an onset in childhood or in adolescence, is often misdiagnosed, has no known cure, and requires lifelong treatment, it is an important disease from a managed care perspective. Clinical features, as well as objective testing, should be used to ensure the timely diagnosis and treatment of patients with narcolepsy. CONCLUSION Policies for the diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy should be based on the current treatment guidelines, but they should also encourage shared decisions between clinicians and patients to allow for individualized diagnostic and treatment choices, as suggested in best practice recommendations.",

Uma das causas da síndrome demêncial é a hidrocefalia normobárica (HNB), a qual afeta principalmente pessoas idosas, sendo possivelmente resultado de algum trauma ou doença, ainda que as causas exatas não estejam totalmentes claras. Esta pode ser apresentada com a clássica tríade: distúrbio de marcha (atáxica ou apráxica), demência e incontinência urinária e, é definida pelo acúmulo do líquido cefalorraquidiano (LCR ou líquor) nas cavidades ventriculares cranianas. O LCR banha o cérebro e a medula espinhal tendo como uma de suas finalidades a de evitar que possíveis traumas atinjam e comprometam o funcionamento adequado do sistema nervoso central (SNC). O diagnóstico dessa doença pode ser difícil e, muitas vezes ser confundido com outras patologias como o mal de Parkinson e o Alzheimer, além disso, o quadro clínico destas doenças podem estar sobrepostos e, muitas vezes, pacientes tratados para HNB podem estar sofrendo também de outra condição.

In addition the relationship between mental stress, fatigue and cognitive impairments such as subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are also discussed. We discuss the rationale that for treatment of asthenic conditions accompanied by cognitive dysfunction it is justified to use combination therapy - fonturacetam and a preparation containing nicotinoyl-GABA and Ginkgo Biloba.Астенические состояния характеризуются повышенной утомляемостью, нарушением повседневного функционирования и снижением работоспособности.

      "title": "Nothing Tastes as Good as Skinny Feels: the Neurobiology of Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) engage in relentless restrictive eating and often become severely emaciated. Because there are no proven treatments, AN has high rates of relapse, chronicity, and death. Those with AN tend to have childhood temperament and personality traits, such as anxiety, obsessions, and perfectionism, which may reflect neurobiological risk factors for developing AN. Restricted eating may be a means of reducing negative mood caused by skewed interactions between serotonin aversive or inhibitory and dopamine reward systems. Brain imaging studies suggest that altered eating is a consequence of dysregulated reward and/or awareness of homeostatic needs, perhaps related to enhanced executive ability to inhibit incentive motivational drives. An understanding of the neurobiology of this disorder is likely to be important for developing more effective treatments.

Chemotherapy-induced neurological adverse effects can reduce treatment efficacy or lead to treatment failure, and can impair the patient's quality of life. Neurotoxicity is more likely when chemotherapy is combined with radiotherapy. Concomitantly prescribed supportive therapy, and the disease itself, can make it difficult to identify the cause of neurological adverse effects. However, the type and degree of toxicity has been shown to be related to the drug type, dose-intensity and cumulative dosage.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

In the acute post-concussion state, it is common to feel irritable, more emotional, and to have difficulty falling asleep, which are non-specific symptoms commonly observed in anxiety disorders. Concussion injuries sometimes occur in a psychically charged environment, which may potentiate acute anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. These disorders can then potentiate prolonged post-concussion persistent symptoms. It is important to differentiate between post-concussion anxiety symptoms and the development of an anxiety disorder.

Nearly coincident with this reaction, they developed progressive cognitive deficits consistent with frontotemporal dementia. These patients illustrate emergent neuroleptic hypersensitivity as an early manifestation of other dementias. The predisposition to neuroleptic hypersensitivity could result from depleted nigral dopaminergic neurons suggested by \"smudging\" of the substantia nigra pars compacta on magnetic resonance imaging.",

Acute hypoxia exerts a differential impact on different deficits of mnestic and cognitive functions. Instrumental reflexes of active and passive avoidance, negative learning, behavior with a change in the stereotype of learning are more greatly damaged. Memory with spatial and visual differentiation and their rearrangement change to a lesser extent and conditional reflexes are not deranged. In this contract, altitude hypoxic adaptation enhances information fixation and increases the degree and duration of retention of temporary relations. Nootropic agents with an antihypoxic action exert a marked effect on hypoxia-induced cognitive and memory disorders and the magnitude of this effect depends on the ration of proper nootropic to antihypoxic components in the spectrum of the drugs' pharmacological activity. The agents that combine a prevailing antiamnestic effect and a marked and moderate antihypoxic action (mexidole, nooglutil, pyracetam, beglymin, etc.) are most effective in eliminating different hypoxia-induced cognitive and memory disorders, nootropic drugs that have a pronounced antiamnestic activity (centrophenoxine, etc.) and no antihypoxic component also restore the main types of mnestic disorders after hypoxia, but to a lesser extent.",

      "abstract": "With the aging of the population over the world, clinicians are called to confront more and more with depression and dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease/other neurodegenerative types and vascular dementia. Depression and dementia raise widespread concerns due to their negative consequences on physical functions, quality of life and mortality in the elderly, associated to undesirable effects on caregivers and society. Growing evidence from population studies indicates that latelife depression (LLD) often accompanies dementia through its stages of severity, but also it is a major risk factor for development of later dementia, or again it can be configured as prodromal manifestation of dementia. Although the nature of the relationship between the two mental disorders is unclear and results of research are heterogeneous, many scholars point out that currently depression is underdiagnosed and -treated by clinicians and speculate that an appropriate diagnosis, monitoring and treatment (using antidepressants and/or other pharmacological/ non-pharmacological regimes) could be of benefit for elderly, regardless of the severity of cognitive decline or even in subjects with adequate cognitive abilities. The authors of this paper, describe and reflect about some problematic characteristics of the relationship between LLD and dementia, taking into consideration epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical aspects. In their opinion, a conceptual organization of the think around the role plays by depression in dementia could be of some utility to optimize clinical practice.",

Optimistic older people have also been found to have lower rates of both mortality and institutionalisation over a ten-year period. This may be because of reduced levels of stress.

      "abstract": "Low dose morphine epidurals (0.5 to 4 mg) provide a good way of controlling either per or postoperative pain (210 cases) or chronic, somatic, intractable pain (282 cases). Selective and metameric medullar hypoalgesia is induced at a level which varies with the level of injection. There is an acquired tolerance which restricts the use of such injections to the short-term monitoring of somatic pain. In other types of psychogenic and deafferentiation pain, there is little or no sedation, but there are maximum secondary dysphoric effects. The degree of combination of these dysphoric effects with hypoalgesia is of diagnostic interest of the type of pain involved, and of prognostic interest when both somatic and deafferentation pains are present.",

It is associated with retrograde amnesia and repetitive questioning. During the attack patients remain conscious and communicative and personal identity is preserved. Focal neurological symptoms and epileptic features are absent and general conditions appear intact. The ability to store new memories gradually recovers and subjects return to normal conditions except for a substantial amnestic gap for the duration of the attack. TGA has an incidence of 3-8 per 100 000 people per year. It usually affects patients between the ages of 50 and 70 years, at an average age of 61 years; occurrence in patients younger than 40 years of age is rare. The rate of recurrence is between 6% and 10% per years. No gender prevalence has been recorded. The patients with definite TGA have a very good prognosis; their rate of subsequent major vascular events is less than 1% per year.",

These side effects often occur early in treatment and they usually respond to dosage reduction and/or the addition of corrective medication. More recently a quite different syndrome, tardive dyskinesia has been found to be associated with antipsychotic drug use. Many aspects of the characteristics, etiology, prevention, and treatment of this variegated set of symptom complexes are very unclear at this time. However, patients who clearly show this syndrome are not uncommon and the condition sometimes persists with little improvement for periods of one to two years or indefinitely. The condition does not respond to antiparkinsonian medication.

This can be the result of morphologic and functional changes underlying temporal lobe epilepsy. Epilepsy patients have increased risk of status epilepticus. It is a life-threatening condition when seizures last for more than 30 min and trigger processes leading to neuronal apoptosis and necrosis in various parts of brain. Administration of neuroprotective drugs preventing these pathologic processes could improve the prognosis for such patients. However despite of active research of neuroprotective drugs, the effective ways to prevent brain damage resulting from prolonged seizures are yet to be found. Studies of neuroprotective properties of classic and novel anticonvulsant drugs showed that most of them do not have the sufficient neuroprotective effect and are not able to prevent epileptogenesis. Thus the studies of other potential neuroprotective drugs seem to be promising.",

This finding probably relates to the widespread distribution of the pathological changes that account for the varied and complex spectrum of clinical manifestations. Dopaminergic drugs are regularly used for the parkinsonian features; however, these rarely result in more than modest benefit, and when better or sustained responses are obtained, as sometimes occurs in progressive supranuclear palsy, the clinical features are atypical and diagnosis is often delayed or not made in life. A variety of other treatments have been used in both disorders, sometimes directed at other specific features such as dystonia or myoclonus, and these treatments will be reviewed. Greater success in treating these disorders will require advances in our understanding of their cause(s) or the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative processes. The similarities in the molecular pathology of these four-repeat tauopathies suggests that important advances in the management of one will have a definite impact on the treatment of the other.",

      "abstract": "Background: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is the stage of an individual’s life in which there can be traced a slight amount of decline in cognitive functioning that comprised of memory and thinking skills. This decay in cognitive functioning does not affect the daily functioning of a patient’s life as it happens in the case of dementia. Objective: To review various forms of screening test measures to assess mild cognitive impairment and its extension towards the gradual onset towards the severe cognitive dysfunctioning such as dementia. Method: There are certain functional impairments that are identical to each other. As far as memory and thinking abilities are concerned, its range may vary from minimal to mild that remains quite unnoticed by the person. Results: Presently, the impact of medication is not so effective for MCI. Regular practices of exercises, mind activity and social involvement may help in decreasing risk of further cognitive function decline. Patients with MCI may carry greater risks of developing dementia as compared to the general population. The present paper discusses various intervention techniques and screening measures to mitigate the prevalence of MCI and to reduce progression of dementia. Conclusion: Prevalence of Mild Cognitive Impairment could be reduced with the primary administration of intervention strategies and technology in order to reduce its progression to dementia. The classification and categorization of MCI in getting broader and clear day by day. The expansion in the use of imaging techniques and other neurological intervention strategies may further enhance the detection of subjects with MCI.",

Sie zeigen weder Linearität zum körperlichen Beeinträchtigungsgrad gemessen mittels Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), noch gibt es eine direkte Relation zur Erkrankungsdauer. Kognitive Defizite können bereits früh im Krankheitsgeschehen, beispielsweise bei einem Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) oder Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) auftreten und werden auch bei Patienten mit einem benignen Verlauf beobachtet. Obgleich die Progression als eher moderat betrachtet werden kann, wirken sich kognitive Einbußen in beinahe jedem Stadium stark negativ auf die Lebensqualität und die Therapieadhärenz aus. Diagnostisch sind wir in der Lage mittels sensitiver Screeninginstrumente diejenigen kognitiven Teilfunktionen zu erfassen, die bei MS-Patienten am häufigsten beeinträchtigt sind. Wie so häufig in der Medizin hinkt jedoch die Therapie dem Fortschritt bei der Diagnostik hinterher, sodass wir keine zuverlässige evidenzbasierte symptomatische Therapie zur Behandlung kognitiver Defizite bei MS zur Verfügung haben. Derzeit sind nonpharmakologische Ansätze, mit dem Ziel die kognitive Reserve des Gehirns zu stärken, Erfolg versprechend. Methodisch saubere Wirksamkeitsstudien stehen allerdings noch aus.",

In addition, delirium is usually a sign of the presence of significant medical complications and is associated with increased mortality. The signs and symptoms of this disorder are diverse and maybe mistaken for other psychiatric disorders including mood and anxiety disorders. Different terms have been used to denote delirium over the years, including confusion, acute confusional states, acute brain failure, acute dementia, acute organic syndrome, cerebral insufficiency, metabolic encephalopathy, organic brain syndrome, reversible toxic psychosis, and intensive care unit psychosis (2). This inconsistent terminology has contributed to the insufficient understanding of delirium in clinical and research settings (2).

      "abstract": "&amp;nbsp;Alzheimer’s disease is known to be the most common cause of dementia with increasing number of people suffering every year. In healthy adults, there are millions of neurons in the brain. Degeneration starts and extends in Alzheimer's disease many years before the initial symptoms show up. The neurons taking part in cognitive functions destroy gradually leading to functional disability and finally to death. β amyloid plaques and tau protein are known as the most responsible causes of Alzheimer’s disease resulting in neurodegeneration. Inflammation, atrophy and dysfunction in glucose metabolism will follow. The three stages of the disease include mild, moderate and severe. The patient will have difficulty in cognitive functions, show changes in behavior and will need care for everyday needs, which increases by the disease progress. There are pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches for treatment. The pharmacologic approaches comprise acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as donepezil or N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockers like memantine. None of them stops the disease but alleviate the symptoms. On the other hand, non-pharmacologic approaches are usually used to improve the patient’s quality of life or improve the behavioral aspects of the disease. Recently, involving physical activity as a non-pharmacologic method of treatment for Alzheimer’s disease has been the focus of many studies. This chapter will have a glance at the clinical trials that were conducted regarding the effect of physical exercise and its impact on Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;",

However, there is no available neuropsychological resource reviewing the literature on the associated neurocognitive deficits in children and adolescents. This review comprehensively examines the 23 prior studies that evaluated the intellectual, language, visual-spatial, memory, motor, and/or attention/executive functions in children and adolescents following an experience of childhood abuse and/or neglect. Neurocognitive impairments were frequently reported. Impairments in executive functions were the most frequent and severe reported impairments, although intelligence, language, visual-spatial skills, and memory are also at serious risk for compromised development following maltreatment. However, specific factors such as abuse/neglect duration, severity, type, and timing during development were all associated with neurocognition. This indicates that these factors are of greater importance than just the presence of abuse/neglect in identifying risk for neurocognitive compromise. Such neurocognitive deficits appear to be a consequence to the known neurobiological and brain development abnormalities of this population, suggesting traumatic stress can be a potential cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings have critical implications for the clinical practice and research involving children following childhood maltreatment and other types of traumatic stress.",

      "abstract": "The concept of treatment-refractory addiction (TRA), while relatively new to the addiction field, is a well-established concept in other areas of medicine and psychiatry. Recent commentaries have highlighted the need for clearer conceptualization and definition of TRA. This commentary argues that conceptual frameworks established in other psychiatric domains (eg, depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder) can and should inform the development of criteria and strategies for identifying and addressing TRA in substance use disorders (SUDs). Central to this effort is the recognition that treatment response variability is the norm rather than the exception in SUD care. Conceptualizations and definitions of TRA should seek to distinguish true refractoriness from suboptimal or incomplete treatment exposure, which can arise from inadequate treatment exposure or adherence, and consider whether nonresponse is present from the start (primary refractoriness) or emerges over time (secondary refractoriness). Advanced analytic methods, including unsupervised clustering, offer opportunities to characterize heterogeneity in treatment outcomes in aggregate or over time, identify patient subgroups that do not benefit from standard therapies, and explore underlying mechanisms of nonresponse. By integrating lessons learned from other psychiatric disorders, addiction scientists can develop more precise definitions of TRA, which will ultimately inform the development of diagnostic/prognostic frameworks, and targeted interventions.",

      "title": "The Treatment of Acute Agitation in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Acute agitation is a nonspecific term applied to an array of syndromes and behaviors. It is frequently defined as an increase in psychomotor activity, aggression, disinhibition/impulsivity, and irritable or labile mood. Etiologies of acute agitation include medical disorders, delirium, substance intoxication or withdrawal, psychiatric disorders, and medication side effects. Treatment of acute agitation requires both environmental and pharmacologic intervention. Patients should be calmed with sedating agents early in the course of treatment, allowing for diagnostic tests to take place. Failure to correctly diagnose causes of agitation may lead to delayed treatment for serious conditions, and can even exacerbate agitation.The most common cause of agitation in patients with schizophrenia is psychotic relapse due to medication nonadherence. Pharmacologic treatment options for these patients include lorazepam and antipsychotic agents. Lorazepam causes nonspecific sedation and treats some substance withdrawal, but has little effect on psychosis. First-generation antipsychotics treat psychosis and, at high enough doses, cause sedation, but may induce extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Some second-generation antipsychotics have been approved for the treatment of agitation in schizophrenia. These agents treat psychosis with a favorable EPS profile, but are comparatively expensive and cause risks such as hypotension. However, avoiding EPS may reduce patients' resistance to antipsychotic treatment. In this expert roundtable supplement, Joseph Battaglia, MD, provides an overview of the definition of acute agitation. Next, Delbert, G. Robinson, MD, outlines evaluation methods for actue agitation. Finally, Leslie Citrome, MD, MPH, reviews interventions for acute and ongoing management of agitation.",

A patient's level of consciousness may or may not be affected. Delirium leads to poor outcomes: increased cost, worsened cognition, increased risk of falls, institutionalization, and increased mortality. A single factor can lead to delirium development; however, more often, the cause for delirium is multifactorial. Underlying causes such as an infection, electrolyte imbalance, and deliriogenic medications combined with underlying risk factors contribute to delirium. Delirium is thought to be reversible, although severe, prolonged delirium may have permanent cognitive effects. Following full treatment with clinical improvement, delirium may linger for weeks to months - its trajectory can be challenging to predict. Brain imaging in the neuroscience patient may demonstrate improvement overall; however, delirium may continue to wax and wane.",

      "title": "Acute Alcohol and Cognition: Remembering What It Causes Us to Forget",
      "abstract": "Addiction has been conceptualized as a specific form of memory that appropriates typically adaptive neural mechanisms of learning to produce the progressive spiral of drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior, perpetuating the path to addiction through aberrant processes of drug-related learning and memory. From that perspective, to understand the development of alcohol use disorders, it is critical to identify how a single exposure to alcohol enters into or alters the processes of learning and memory, so that involvement of and changes in neuroplasticity processes responsible for learning and memory can be identified early. This review characterizes the effects produced by acute alcohol intoxication as a function of brain region and memory neurocircuitry. In general, exposure to ethanol doses that produce intoxicating effects causes consistent impairments in learning and memory processes mediated by specific brain circuitry, whereas lower doses either have no effect or produce a facilitation of memory under certain task conditions. Therefore, acute ethanol does not produce a global impairment of learning and memory, and can actually facilitate particular types of memory, perhaps particular types of memory that facilitate the development of excessive alcohol use. In addition, the effects on cognition are dependent on brain region, task demands, dose received, pharmacokinetics, and tolerance. Additionally, we explore the underlying alterations in neurophysiology produced by acute alcohol exposure that help to explain these changes in cognition and highlight future directions for research. Through understanding the impact that acute alcohol intoxication has on cognition, the preliminary changes potentially causing a problematic addiction memory can better be identified.",

      "title": "Neurobiological evidence for epilepsy-induced interictal disturbances.",
      "abstract": "It is not in the best interest of persons with epilepsy to deny the possibility that seizures could cause enduring behavioral disturbances. Rather, it is essential to pursue clinical and animal investigations in order to identify any such changes that might occur and to elucidate their mechanisms. Many testable hypotheses can be developed from existing evidence. Antiepileptic medication may produce interictal behavioral disturbances in patients with epilepsy by indirect mechanisms. Some aberrant behaviors could be due to medication-induced systemic disorders, neuroendocrine dysfunction, or REM deficit, whereas depression following successful treatment with drugs, as well as with surgery, may be related more specifically to cessation of seizures. The underlying neuropathological process also induces neurological and mental deficits, but it is not always possible to differentiate those behavioral disturbances due to destructive effects of the lesion from those due to recurrent epileptic seizures. Behavioral disturbances are associated more frequently with epileptogenic lesions in limbic structures than with those elsewhere in the brain, but a relationship between hemispheric lateralization of the epileptogenic lesion and specific interictal behavioral symptoms remains controversial. When considering the effects of seizures per se on interictal behavior, it is important to realize that some \"interictal\" behavioral disturbances may actually be ictal events. Prolonged affective, autonomic, and psychic disturbances can occur in clear consciousness with unilateral limbic seizures that are not associated with scalp EEG changes. When epilepsy is acquired as a result of cerebral damage, the epileptogenic process takes time to develop before spontaneous seizures appear. It is more reasonable to assume that this progressive process continues than to postulate that it stops completely at the time the first seizure occurs. Epilepsy-induced protective homeostatic mechanisms that act to terminate ictal events, prevent ictal spread, and maintain the interictal state may also disrupt interictal function. Furthermore, seizures could indirectly influence interictal behavior as a result of their effects on neuroendocrine function and sleep. Because of confounding biological factors, it is difficult to document the association of any epilepsy disorder, by itself, with progressive behavioral disturbances in humans. Secondary epileptogenesis, protective homeostatic mechanisms, and epilepsy-induced disturbances in development can be readily demonstrated, however, in experimental animal models. In experimental animals, endogenous opoids are released during seizures and mediate some postictal behaviors. A physiological dependency on high levels of endogenous opioids released during seizures could produce depression as a withdrawal symptom interictally or when seizures no longer occur as a result of successful therapy. Experimental animal models of depression exist to test hypotheses concerning pro- and antidepressant effects of epileptogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

When a person starts using drugs, it starts getting addicted to them and gradually it can’t help but act on the impulse to use them regardless of the damage caused to the body of addicted person. Drug isn’t about just illegal drugs. A person can get addicted to alcohol, painkillers, nicotine and other legal substances. Drug addiction is a deathly disease found in almost every year of age. The disease is mostly carried by people who are mentally frustrated, physically or mentally abused, facing financial problem or family problems and is desperate to get some sort of relief that comes with the high of drugs even if it proves to be grim for their health in the long run. Addiction starts with the continuous use of dosage of any drug, until the point that an individual starts feeling anxious without the availability of them. Slowly and painfully, these drugs starts making a person totally relied on them and it is basically impossible for the individual to survive without them. There can be many reasons as to why an individual decides to go on this path of addiction. Economic problems, state of utter sadness in case of the death of a loved one or a closed one, societal stress, isolation, aggression, bad or wrong company, in state of depression and anxiety are the most likely situations in which a person starts taking drugs. Along with many other factors, families often play a vital role in pushing an individual towards seeking comfort and relief from the drugs. Developing countries like Pakistan and many others are facing the problem as there are not many effective and active rehabilitation centers. In this research article, the role of families contributing in an individual’s drug addiction is elaborated. This research article is done with the help of many researches, as well as some interviews were conducted regarding certain factors and the answers were given according to the observation and views of responders. The conclusion is drawn with the help of articles and personal opinions and observations regarding how a person leans toward substance or drug usage because of certain family issues and problems.",

      "title": "FBXL4-Related Encephalomyopathic Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics FBXL4-related encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome is a multi-system disorder characterized primarily by congenital or early-onset lactic acidosis and growth failure, feeding difficulty, hypotonia, and developmental delay. Other neurologic manifestations can include seizures, movement disorders, ataxia, autonomic dysfunction, and stroke-like episodes. All affected individuals alive at the time they were reported (median age: 3.5 years) demonstrated significant developmental delay. Other findings can involve the heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital heart malformations, arrhythmias), liver (mildly elevated transaminases), eyes (cataract, strabismus, nystagmus, optic atrophy), hearing (sensorineural hearing loss), and bone marrow (neutropenia, lymphopenia). Survival varies; the median age of reported deaths was two years (range 2 days – 75 months), although surviving individuals as old as 36 years have been reported. To date FBXL4-related mtDNA depletion syndrome has been reported in 50 individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of FBXL4-related mtDNA depletion syndrome is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in FBXL4 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management is best provided by a multidisciplinary team including neurology, nutrition, clinical genetics/metabolism, and developmental pediatrics. Other specialties may be involved as needed. To date no definite treatment is available; thus, treatment is mainly supportive: assuring adequate nutrition and standard treatment of neurologic complications including developmental delay / intellectual disability, seizures, cardiac complications, eye involvement, and hearing loss. Administration of cofactors and antioxidants, used in mitochondrial disorders with (generally) limited evidence of benefit, may be considered. Surveillance: No surveillance guidelines have been published. The treating physician should decide about the frequency of follow up of eyes, hearing, heart, feeding difficulties, liver, neurologic complications, and neutropenia based on the patient's findings. Genetic counseling FBXL4-related mtDNA depletion syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. When both parents are heterozygous carriers, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier (heterozygote), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the FBXL4 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Disadvantageous decision-making and impaired volitional control over actions, thoughts, and emotions are characteristics of a wide range of mental disorders such as addiction, eating disorders, depression, and anxiety disorders and may reflect transdiagnostic core mechanisms and possibly vulnerability factors. Elucidating the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms is a precondition for moving from symptom-based to mechanism-based disorder classifications and ultimately mechanism-targeted interventions. However, despite substantial advances in basic research on decision-making and cognitive control, there are still profound gaps in our current understanding of dysfunctions of these processes in mental disorders. Central unresolved questions are: (i) to which degree such dysfunctions reflect transdiagnostic mechanisms or disorder-specific patterns of impairment; (ii) how phenotypical features of mental disorders relate to dysfunctional control parameter settings and aberrant interactions between large-scale brain systems involved in habit and reward-based learning, performance monitoring, emotion regulation, and cognitive control; (iii) whether cognitive control impairments are consequences or antecedent vulnerability factors of mental disorders; (iv) whether they reflect generalized competence impairments or context-specific performance failures; (v) whether not only impaired but also chronic over-control contributes to mental disorders. In the light of these gaps, needs for future research are: (i) an increased focus on basic cognitive-affective mechanisms underlying decision and control dysfunctions across disorders; (ii) longitudinal-prospective studies systematically incorporating theory-driven behavioural tasks and neuroimaging protocols to assess decision-making and control dysfunctions and aberrant interactions between underlying large-scale brain systems; (iii) use of latent-variable models of cognitive control rather than single tasks; (iv) increased focus on the interplay of implicit and explicit cognitive-affective processes; (v) stronger focus on computational models specifying neurocognitive mechanisms underlying phenotypical expressions of mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

As a rule, late-life depression afflicts medically ill, disabled persons living under chronic stress and/or isolation. Symptoms and signs of medical illnesses and behavioral limitations from disability are often difficult to distinguish from depressive symptomatology. Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next. Clinical subpopulations of late-life depression — psychotic depression, dysthymic disorder, depression associated with an adverse life event, treatment-resistant depression, and residual symptoms of depression — require special attention.",

      "abstract": "The pharmacotherapy of epilepsy is a complex process guided by evidence-based research and clinical experience. Some patients achieve seizure freedom upon treatment with the first anti-seizure medication (ASM) prescribed, whereas others may be treated with two or three medications before one (or a combination) is found that reduces seizure frequency and/or severity with minimal side effects. Many patients demonstrate a partial response to treatment, leading to reduced seizure frequency and/or severity, but do not become completely seizure free. It is often stated that ~30% of epilepsy patients have seizures that cannot be controlled pharmacologically, and these patients are defined as having medication-resistant epilepsy (MRE). The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) published the following definition of MRE: ‘drug resistant epilepsy may be defined as failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used ASM schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom’[1]. Treatment success or sustained seizure freedom is defined as one year without seizures or three times the inter-seizure interval (whichever is longer). The ILAE definition provides a useful standard from which to work, and MRE can be clinically identified in patients that fail to achieve seizure freedom after multiple ASM trials. However, the ILAE definition of successful treatment does not account for partial response to pharmacotherapy. Indeed, many partial responders have improved quality of life, even if they are not seizure-free for one year or more.",

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "abstract": "Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients almost uniformly suffer from sleep disruption. Even though the role of sleep disturbances is not still adequately understood, they may be related to metabolic, immune, neurological and respiratory dysfunction and could worsen the quality of life after discharge. A harsh ICU environment, underlying disease, mechanical ventilation, pain and drugs are the main reasons that underlie sleep disruption in the critically ill. Polysomnography is the gold standard in evaluating sleep, but it is not feasible in clinical practice; therefore, other objective (bispectral index score [BIS] and actigraphy) and subjective (nurse and patient assessment) methods have been proposed, but their adequacy in ICU patients is not clear. Frequent evaluation of neurological status with validated tools is necessary to avoid excessive or prolonged sedation in order to better titrate patient-focused therapy. Hypnotic agents like benzodiazepines can increase total sleep time, but they alter the physiological progression of sleep phases, and decrease the time spent in the most restorative phases compared to the phases normally mediated by melatonin; melatonin production is decreased in critically ill patients, and as such, exogenous melatonin supplementation may improve sleep quality. Sleep disruption and the development of delirium are frequently related, both because of sleep scarcity and inappropriate dosing with sedatives. Delirium is strongly related to increased ICU morbidity and mortality, thus the resolution of sleep disruption could significantly contribute to improved ICU outcomes. An early evaluation of delirium is strongly recommended because of the potential to resolve the underlying causes or to begin an appropriate therapy. Further studies are needed on the effects of strategies to promote sleep and on the evaluation of better sleep in clinical outcomes, particularly on the development of delirium.",

It can be caused by a variety of pharmaceuticals that includes clozapine. The etiology in clozapine cases includes anticholinergic effects and a neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like picture. The risk for a clozapine induced delirium is greater at high dosages, during dose increases, and with polypharmacy. Resolution follows clozapine dose reductions and/or medicine discontinuations.

Tilstanden er vanlig etter ervervet hjerneskade. I artikkelen gis en oversikt over kunnskapsstatus om utmattelse etter hjerneslag og etter traumatiske hjerneskader. KUNNSKAPSGRUNNLAG KUNNSKAPSGRUNNLAG En vurdering av eksisterende litteratur, inkludert litteratursøk, samt vår kliniske erfaring ligger til grunn for innholdet i artikkelen. RESULTATER RESULTATER I eksisterende undersøkelser er det brukt varierende definisjoner av tilstanden og det er anvendt ulike kartleggingsverktøy. Forekomsten av utmattelse etter hjerneslag eller traumatisk hjerneskade er usikker på grunn av ulike inklusjonskriterier og kartleggingsmetoder og fordi ulikt måletidspunkt kan gi ulike prevalenstall. I flere arbeider anslås forekomsten til å ligge mellom 50 % og 70 %. Vår kunnskap om de patologiske mekanismene er svært begrenset. Både premorbide, sosiodemografiske, slag-/traumerelaterte og komorbide faktorer spiller inn på hvordan pasienten oppfatter tilstanden. Blant anvendte behandlingstiltak er psykoedukasjon, aktivitetsregulering, fysisk trening og behandling av komorbide tilstander. Det er også gjort forsøk med medikamentell behandling, foreløpig uten overbevisende resultater. FORTOLKNING FORTOLKNING Utmattelse er vanlig hos hjerneslagpasienter og pasienter med traumatiske hjerneskader og begrenser ofte i betydelig grad deres hverdag. Vår viten om patologiske mekanismer og behandlingstiltak er mangelfull, og pasientpopulasjonen er heterogen. Behandlingen er individuelt tilpasset og har som mål at den enkelte skal kunne bruke sin begrensede kapasitet på en mest mulig hensiktsmessig måte.",

These disorders arise at the intersection of lesion-related brain dysfunction and psychological distress related to the event and its aftermath, making it difficult to identify what symptom is a direct physiological consequence of the stroke. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, apathy, emotionalism, and anger are the most common of these syndromes, and posttraumatic stress disorder related to the stroke event has become increasingly recognized as a relevant entity. Mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychosis are less commonly encountered but potentially highly debilitating conditions that may be underrecognized. Early identification and treatment may mitigate functional impairment and improve quality of life. Evidence-based guidelines from the general population are often relied upon to guide treatment.

      "title": "Drug anticipation and the treatment of dependence.",
      "abstract": "Results of much research demonstrate that tolerance is not the inevitable consequence of repeated drug exposure: the drug-experienced organism often demonstrates tolerance when the drug is administered in the context of the usual predrug cues, but not in the context of alternative cues. Such findings raise the importance of learning factors above that of the purely physiological factors in substance abuse. Incorporated in a model of tolerance that emphasizes the Pavlovian conditioning of an association between predrug cues and the systemic effect of the drug are findings that learned tolerance leads to death by overdose. A history of association results in drug-compensatory conditional responses, and these conditional pharmacological responses may be displayed as \"withdrawal symptoms\" and craving when the organism with a history of drug administration is confronted with the usual predrug cues without the usual pharmacological consequences. An implication of the conditioning analysis is that successful treatment of drug addiction should acknowledge not only pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic principles, but also the powerful evocative effects of drug-predictive environmental cues. Permanent abstinence is most likely if the treated addict is either protected from reexposure to these predrug cues (for example, by residence relocation), or treated with a protocol which incorporates extinction of the association between these cues and the drug. As Hamlet suggested to his mother (Act III, Scene 4): Assume a virtue if you have it not ... refrain tonight; And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence: the next more easy; For use almost can change the stamp of nature And master ev'n the devil or throw him out With wondrous potency.",

      "abstract": "In a general sense, insomnia suggests inadequate sleep quality or quantity when one has an adequate opportunity to sleep. When defined as a sleep disorder, insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep, which may represent problems with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening despite attempts to be sleeping. Sleep disorder nosologies also may include a complaint of nonrefreshing sleep as an insomnia complaint. For a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder to be made, daytime consequences or functional impairment also should be present. These may include fatigue, inability to concentrate, or irritability. Insomnia may be characterized as primary or comorbid (1). Primary insomnia occurs independently while comorbid insomnia presumably is associated with a sleep disturbance related to another disorder. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the general population at least occasionally and is a severe or chronic problem for about 10% of the population. Patients with co-occurring conditions have significantly increased risk for insomnia (2). People suffering with insomnia have increased healthcare costs and utilize health resources to a greater extent. They also have worse scores on quality-of-life measures. Persistent insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for the development or exacerbation of certain psychiatric and medical conditions. Overall, insomnia represents a significant socioeconomic burden both for individuals and for society. This chapter will provide an overview of current perspectives on the causes, consequences, and associations of insomnia.ETIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND PATHOGENESIS",

In the pubertal period behavioural deviations and neuropsychic disturbances usually reach a degree of obvious pathology (psychopathies, psychogenias) in cases where a long-standing psychotraumatic situation is combined with unfavourable biological factors such as minimum brain deficit, severe and prolonged debilitating somatic disease, a shain of infections, and pathological heredity.",

The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

The first one is dopamine hyperactivity in mesolimbic neural pathways, the second one is a cognitive process of up-down attribution of meanings of this subjectively perceived state of mind by the higher levels of brain. After the successful antipsychotic treatment, the subjectivity of patients changes. When the state of acute psychosis resolves patients must re-interpret this new emerging subjective experience. These interpretations are often incorrect and bizarre. In most cases they are regarded as delusions (sometimes \"chronic delusions\"). The question asked in the presented paper is whether they are truly delusions. The essence of delusion must include in the same time an active neurobiological basis of delusion (hyperdopaminergic state) and its cognitive level. It's not clear what is the proper term for the phenomenon when only incorrect or bizarre cognitive convictions are present after successful treatment of psychosis, but without dopaminergic hyperactivity.",

      "abstract": "Complementary Therapies in Neurology: An Evidence-Based Approach Edited by Barry S.Oken ISBN 1-84214-200-3 Copyright © 2004 by The Parthenon Publishing Group, LondonDementia is a common age-associated condition increasing in prevalence from about 1% at age 65 to over 50% above age 90. Dementia has many causes, some of which are easily treated (e.g. metabolic disturbances such as thyroid disease), while others have no treatments with a clear disease-modifying effect, such as the primary central nervous system degenerations1. The most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia and these will be the only two specific diseases in addition to the non-specific dementia syndrome discussed in this chapter; other dementia syndromes are not discussed because of the lack of specific data relevant to this chapter. The clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease is considered the time point at which there are signs of cognitive dysfunction in at least two domains of cognition (e.g. memory, attention, language, visuospatial function and 'frontal lobe' function) and the cognitive dysfunction is causing problems with daily social or occupational function. Before the cognitive deficits become so problematic, there is a period when the person may have some complaints of memory loss and objective deficits in memory or other cognitive domains but has no change in more than one domain and no change in daily function. This is considered mild cognitive impairment (MCI), although there are a host of other terms for closely related conditions (e.g. age-associated memory impairment). About 50% of people with MCI may go on to develop overt Alzheimer's disease over a 5-year period2. There is also a period even prior to the onset of MCI when there is accumulating pathology in the brain and there is possible subtle cognitive change. While this chapter does not review treatments for this latter class of individuals (basically all middle-aged adults), a significant proportion of the population believes that some dietary supplements may impact aging. A Harris poll of 1010 people in the USA found that 78% of the respondents felt that vitamin supplements would provide some or a great deal of help in generally healthy people in growing old and 58% felt the same way about herbs or herbal products3. There is a high use of dietary supplements including vitamins in the aging population. Even in healthy people over the age of 85 years, 25% take vitamin C supplements, 25% vitamin E supplements and 10% Ginkgo biloba extract4.",

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

      "abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by loss of neurons in the frontal and temporal lobes. It is a common cause of early-onset dementia but can also start in older age. It presents with behavioural symptoms or language disturbance (primary progressive aphasia), and patients can also develop symptoms of motor neurone disease. It is a highly heritable disease with one third of patients having a family history and a mutation in one of three genes. The ideal time to treat neurodegenerative disease may be before clinical presentation, at a point where the minimum of irreversible neuronal loss has occurred and cognitive function is still preserved.",

There are no definitive guidelines on its treatment. Although early recognition is emphasised and usually possible, delayed diagnosis is not rare.

Patients attending emergency and unscheduled care settings with acute or chronic mental health conditions are common presentations. Many environments use mental health assessment matrix that assists with identifying risk and urgency for non-mental health trained clinicians. The assessment should identify: presenting problem; social circumstances; current or previous treatment; current or past engagement with mental health services; current medication; and alcohol or drug use. Acute confusion (delirium) involves abnormalities in the patients thought, level of awareness and perception. The incidence of delirium is higher in those patients with a pre-existing cognitive impairment. A panic attack is a sudden feeling of severe anxiety and fear sometimes without warning. The cause may be easily identified and relate to an existing fear or phobia, but panic attacks can also occur for no apparent reason.",

It remains a major cause of neurological disability in young and middle-aged adults suffering from the disease. The severity and type of cognitive impairment varies considerably among individuals and can be observed both in early and in later stages. The areas which have commonly shown more deficits are: information processing speed, complex attention, memory, and executive function. Even though an alteration in both the white matter and in the grey matter has been found in patients with multiple sclerosis and cognitive impairment, the underlying process still remains unknown. Standardized neurological examinations fail to detect emerging cognitive deficits and self-reported cognitive complaints by the patients can be confounded by other subjective symptoms.

These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled.

      "abstract": "Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy (DPHL) is a demyelinating syndrome characterized by acute onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms days to weeks following apparent recovery from coma after a period of prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation. It is diagnosed, after excluding other potential causes of delirium, with a clinical history of carbon monoxide poisoning, narcotic overdose, myocardial infarction, or another global cerebral hypoxic event. The diagnosis can be supported by neuroimaging evidence of diffuse hemispheric demyelination sparing cerebellar and brainstem tracts, or by an elevated cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein. Standard or hyperbaric oxygen following CO poisoning may reduce the likelihood of DPHL or other neurologic sequelae. Bed rest and avoidance of stressful procedures for the first 10 days following any prolonged hypoxic event may also lower the risk. Gradual recovery over a 3 to 12 month period is common, but impaired attention or executive function, parkinsonism, or corticospinal tract signs can persist. Stimulants, amantadine or levodopa may be considered for lasting cognitive or parkinsonian symptoms. Anticipation and recognition of DPHL should lead to earlier and more appropriate utilization of health care services.",

      "title": "What is a minimally conscious state?",
      "abstract": "In recent decades, modern medical technology and resuscitation techniques have produced new neurologic syndromes of severe, and usually irreversible, cognitive and motor disabilities. The three most significant and most common of these syndromes are brain death, vegetative state, and locked-in state. Consensus panels of medical societies have addressed the medical and neurologic aspects of these syndromes, including definitions and essential clinical characteristics.1 Many landmark right-to-die cases have been tested in the courts and widely publicized, and multidisciplinary groups have attempted to develop ethical and legal guidelines for these problematic cases.2\r\n\r\nThe vegetative state is probably the best known of these new syndromes. Patients in a vegetative state are awake but unaware. They have sleep/wake cycles with eyes open for prolonged periods but show no evidence of consciousness on physical examination. The vegetative state becomes permanent at 3 months for patients with anoxicischemic injuries of the brain and after 12 months for those with traumatic injuries. The chance of any meaningful recovery of neurologic functions after these periods of time is extraordinarily rare.\r\n\r\nBut many medical and ethical controversies still surround the vegetative state. Physicians have noted an unacceptably high rate of both false-positive (patients were incorrectly diagnosed as being in a vegetative state when they had some evidence of consciousness) and false-negative (patients were thought to have some degree of consciousness when, in fact, they were truly vegetative) diagnoses.3 Another problem has been the lack of my specific terminology to describe patients who emerge from the vegetative state to the next higher level of consciousness. Several right-to-die cases have involved patients who clearly were not vegetative but were otherwise severely neurologically disabled.\r\n\r\nBecause of these and other controversial issues, a multi-disciplinary group of physicians developed a consensus-based definition of this new syndrome and medical criteria for its diagnosis (the Aspen Work Group).4 Previously described as the minimally responsive state, this new syndrome in which the patient emerges from the vegetative state to have some degree of cognitive function is more accurately labeled the minimally conscious state (MCS). The Wendland case illustrates the essential clinical features of MCS and would definitely fit the diagnostic criteria developed by the Aspen Work Group.5,6\r\n\r\nThe Aspen Work Group defines MCS as “a condition of severely altered consciousness in which minimal, but definite, behavioral evidence of self or environmental awareness is demonstrated.” Before rendering a diagnosis of MCS, the patient must demonstrate on physical examination one or more of four types of behaviors on a reproducible or sustained basis. These neurologic behavioral characteristics at the bedside are shown in the Box. The most important and the one usually first seen when a patient emerges from a vegetative state into MCS is sustained visual pursuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1\r\n\tBehavioral criteria for the diagnosis of MCS*\r\nFollows simple commands\t\r\n\r\n\r\nGives yes or no responses verbally or with gestures\r\n\r\n\r\nVerbalizes intelligibly\r\n\r\n\r\nDemonstrates other purposeful behavior, including nonreflexive movements or affective gestures that occur in direct relationship to relevant environmental stimuli, eg:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappropriate smiling or crying in response to specific emotional stimuli\r\n\r\n\r\nvocalization or gesturing in direct response to linguistic content of questions\r\n\r\n\r\ndirected reaching for objects that demonstrates a clear relationship between object location and direction of reach\r\n\r\n\r\nmodification of touch or grasp to accommodate the size and shapes of objects\r\n\r\n\r\npursuit eye movements or sustained vision fixation upon a external visual stimulus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nView it in a separate window\r\n\r\n\r\n*At least one is required for diagnosis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough MCS patients demonstrate cognitive behaviors to some extent (even though only minimal), they are similar to patients in the vegetative state in other important ways.7 Both are so severely impaired that they have severe immobility and are unable to perform any meaningful activities of daily living. They are unable to communicate meaningfully and have bladder and bowel incontinence. They require the use of a feeding tube but usually are able to breathe without a respirator. Patients in a vegetative state, however, are unconscious and therefore have no awareness of self or environment and show no evidence whatsoever of language comprehension. They do not experience pain and suffering. MCS patients, while severely impaired in terms of consciousness, have some definite, but extremely limited, awareness of self or environment, and limited means of communication. They are able to experience pain and suffering to some degree, although often the actual degree of pain and suffering cannot be determined.8\r\n\r\nFrom a neurologic standpoint, MCS patients are thought to function at the level of a patient with severe or, more accurately, profound dementia. According to the Aspen Work Group, the estimated number of MCS patients in the United States is 112,000 to 180,000 compared with previous estimates of 14,000 to 35,000 patients in the vegetative state.\r\n\r\nMCS patients can be separated into three groups based on the nature of their disease or injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopmental or congenital injuries to the brain occurring before or at birth, eg profound mental retardation\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquired traumatic or nontraumatic injuries to the brain, eg severe head injuries\r\n\r\n\r\nProgressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system, eg Alzheimer disease in the end stage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUse of the term MCS does not necessarily imply permanence or irreversibility of the disease process. Patients emerging into MCS after weeks or months in a vegetative state caused by a traumatic head injury may continue to recover and do well, regaining further significant neurologic functions over a period of months or years. A less favorable prognosis for further recovery can be expected for those MCS patients with end-stage Alzheimer disease, profound mental retardation, or stable acquired traumatic injury to the brain after 1 year.\r\n\r\nThe ethical and legal implications of a potentially transient state are different from similar considerations for a permanent MCS.9 Because our knowledge of MCS is more limited than that of the vegetative state, we cannot say with any degree of certainty at what point after injury to the brain (either nontraumatic or traumatic) the condition becomes permanent. Although the Aspen Work Group noted that meaningful, good recovery after 1 year in an MCS is unlikely, more data are needed to confirm the criteria for and timing of realistic prognosis for recovery.\r\n\r\nJust as the first quarter-century of the right-to-die movement may be exemplified by the medical, legal, and ethical assessments of brain death and the vegetative state, so the first quarter century of the new millennium may be the era of patients who are substantially neurologically impaired but conscious to a variable degree. Perhaps MCS will capture the essence of this next wave.",

Many patients improve but fail to achieve full remission with antidepressant treatment and continue to have residual symptoms, which cause distress and dysfunction. These residual symptoms may meet criteria for subsyndromal and minor depression. Patients who have these milder syndromes after treatment have a greater risk of relapse and recurrence than do those who remain symptom-free. Clinical trials of antidepressants have shown lower rates of remission than of responses that fall short of remission, although some dual-acting antidepressants (e.g., serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) may have higher remission rates than other agents. Treatment with such robust dual-acting antidepressants may result in higher rates of remission and fewer residual symptoms than treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.",

While physical dependence is linked to withdrawal syndrome, psychic dependence, on the Author's opinion, is related to a long-standing previous state of true or masked endogenous depression (in this case it would be well termed as \"neuropsychological dependence\"), and the drug taking is only a maladaptive self-medication. This thesis is substantiated by the literature, reporting, in chronic drug addicts the use of the whole series of antidepressants (i.e. tricyclics, doxepine, lithium, etc.), with noticeable therapeutical success.

      "abstract": "Depression is a common emotional state in humans, which is sometimes triggered by stressful events and certain physical and/or mental conditions that may occur and may increase the body's vulnerability to various types of depressive disorders, causing sometimes organic changes difficult to quantify and to treat. Depressive conditions are major clinical problems that occur throughout life and often require a specialized treatment, but the use of the antidepressant compounds is often endangered by the risk of formidable side effects, requiring to stop the treatment or to use medicine doses that cannot determine the desired therapeutic results. These are reasons for the impressive expansion of the research on the depression types, with emphasize on etiological and etiopathogenetical studies, allowing the discovery of compounds with good therapeutic potential and an appropriate pharmacological profile to reduce the side effects. Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is a major public health problem, with increasing costs and frequency in recent years. Late diagnosis, inadequate treatment, lack of ongoing monitoring or ignorance of the disease can have serious consequences for the health of that individual, his family and his community. The mental state of a patient with diabetes is different from one moment to the next and varies with the stage of the disease and the appearance of various complications. The stress of chronic illness, the pressure to have a lifestyle and a diet according to medical recommendations, sadness, anger and even denial of the disease, are feelings experienced by patients with diabetes at least once in their lives.",

      "title": "Pathophysiology of Addiction",
      "abstract": "Drug addiction, also referred to diagnostically as substance dependence, is a chronically relapsing brain disorder characterized by compulsive drug taking. Different drugs produce different patterns of addiction with three stages: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation. In 2005, 22 million Americans, 9% of the population aged 12 and older, experienced abuse or dependence on alcohol or an illicit drug within the prior 12 months. An additional 25.1 million experienced nicotine dependence. The stages of progression of drug use show that the use of cigarettes (nicotine) or alcohol precedes the use of marijuana (cannabis) and, in turn, the use of marijuana precedes the use of other illicit drugs. Substance abuse and addiction contribute to various medical disorders, including pulmonary and cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, infectious diseases (HIV and hepatitis C), and mental disorders (i.e., anxiety disorder, psychoses). It is estimated that 40–60% of the vulnerability to addiction is attributable to genetic factors. The reinforcing effects of drugs during intoxication set the initial stage that, if perpetuated, triggers the neuronal adaptations that result in addiction. At least four systems have been identified as having an important role in the acute reinforcing effects of drugs abuse: the mesolimbic dopamine system, the opioid peptide system, the γ-aminobutyric acid system, and the endocannabinoid system localized to key circuits in the basal forebrain, including the nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Repeated perturbation of reward circuits (e.g., marked dopamine increases followed by dopamine decreases) results in consequent disruption of the circuits that it regulates (motivation/drive, memory/learning, and control). Addiction also involves a long-term, persistent plasticity in the activity of neural circuits mediating motivational systems that derives from recruitment of brain stress systems such as corticotropin-releasing factor that drive negative emotional states. Abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex including the anterior cingulate gyrus in drug-addicted subjects lead to inadequate decisions that favor immediate rewards over delayed but more favorable responses. The changes in plasticity of these circuits have been hypothesized to involve molecular neuroadaptations such as changes in intracellular signal transduction and/or changes in transcription of particular target genes that can lead to long-term altered neuronal activity and vulnerability to reentering the addictive cycle.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

      "abstract": "The chapter deals with the short- and long-term effects of psychoactive drugs, particularly their effects on the brain, mind and behaviour. In discussing harmful results it should be noted that harm can ensue from misuse of a drug which affects the mind, although dependence on the preparation may not have developed. Misuse is here viewed as the non-medical use of a drug for its seemingly pleasant mental effects. Unintentioned damage can arise from casual, even single misuse, e.g. infection following non-sterile injection or accidental injury while intoxicated. There are many substances whose effects on the brain and mind can lead to misuse and dependence, but they can be grouped into a relatively small number of categories.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic-induced neurological side effects have usually been classified as acute dystonia, Parkinsonism, akathisia and tardive dyskinesia (TD). Recent observations in monkeys and man have revealed that classification in this way is over-simplified because nearly identical extrapyramidal syndromes may appear as a result of 1) neuroleptic treatment, 2) withdrawal of neuroleptic treatment and initiation of anticholinergic treatment, or 3) age and/or the psychotic process. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of the these first two syndromes.Two hundred and two long-term neuroleptically treated psychiatric inpatients were evaluated 1) during treatment with their usual neuroleptic medication, but without anticholinergics for 2 days, and 2) after treatment with anticholinergics for 14 days, the last two of which the neuroleptic treatment was stopped. Patients with extrapyramidal symptoms were divided into subgroups depending on response to this pharmacological manipulation: those who improved during anticholinergic treatment (acute-initial syndromes such as traditional Parkinsonism, akathisia and paradoxical TD) and those who aggravated (tardive syndromes such as tardive akathisia and TD). The prevalence of traditional TD was 42%, ranging from 27% among younger patients (< 40 years) to 50% among older patients (> 60 years) (P < 0.05). «No change» TD was found in 22% of the patients (10% in the youngest, 26% in patients older than 60 years). Paradoxical TD had a prevalence of 8%; this syndrome was more often seen in young patients (18%) than in older patients (6%) (P < 0.05). Patients with paradoxical TD more often had involvement of neck and trunk, and akathisia (50%) than TD patients from the other groups (P < 0.05).Akathisia was seen in 22% without age differences, «no change» akathisia appeared in 5%, and tardive akathisia in 10%, with a trend towards higher prevalence in the younger patients.Forty-eight percent had Parkinsonism (26% in patients younger than 40 years increasing to 60% in patients over 60 years (P < 0.05)), and 20% had «no change» Parkinsonism. Paradoxical Parkinsonism was not registered.The prevalence figures presented are very high, reflecting that the patients included were relatively old (mean: 55.2 years) and that they had been receiving neuroleptics in high doses for several years (mean: 16.4 years). It is further concluded that the number of patients with atypical, paradoxical syndromes is not negligible, but must be taken into account in the treatment and research of movement disorders.",

Although they had been noted more than a century ago and appear prevalent in chronic pain populations, they are poorly studied. They may be very mild or very dense, may occupy large body areas, are often highly dynamic and changeable or, to the contrary, very stable and long lasting. NDSDs may occur in the absence of biomedical pathology or coexist with structural musculoskeletal or nervous system abnormalities. They appear to be associated with psychological factors and a poor prognosis for response to treatment and return to work. Recent brain imaging studies provide a basis for understanding NDSD pathophysiology.NDSDs represent prevalent phenomena associated with chronic pain. Further, research is needed to elucidate their origin, response to treatment, and prevalence in the general population, primary care settings, and nonpain patients.",

      "title": "The Effects of Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders on Waking Performance",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSleep is a necessary and reversible behavioural state of perception, cognition, psyche and physical conditions.Abnormal sleep behaviours may include e.g.difficulties in falling asleep, breathing difficulties such as different kinds of apneas, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep onset-REM, leg movements, sleepwalking, sleep talking, tooth grinding and other physical activities.These anomalies involving sleep processes also include sleep itself, dream imagery or muscle weakness.Within sleep there are two separate states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eyes movement (REM).REM sleep is defined by EEG activation, muscle atony, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movement.NREM (non-REM) sleep is subdivided into four stages (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 -Rechtschaffen & Kales) or three stages (N1, N2 and N3 -AASM), which are defined by the electroencephalogram (EEG).The NREM stages are parallel to the depth of sleep continuum (lowest in stage 1 and highest in stage 4 sleep).NREM sleep and REM sleep continue to alternate through the night in cyclically.REM sleep episodes become longer across the night, stages 3 and 4 become shorter across the night.Sleep disorders have an impact on the structure and distribution of sleep.A distinction is important in diagnosis and in the choice of treatments.There are three very important sleep disorders: Insomnia, Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea Syndrome.Altogether, in Western Europe already suffer more than 10 % of the population from Sleep-Awake-Disturbances which has to be treated urgently; 800,000 from Sleep Apnea Syndromes and 25,000 from Narcolepsy (PETER et al. 1995).1. Insomnia is a sleeplessness and includes a decreased total sleep time, a poor sleep efficiency too little and a poor sleep quality caused by one or more of the following: trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep latency), waking up a lot during the night with trouble returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, and/or having unrefreshing sleep/not feeling well rested (even after sleeping 7 to 8 hours at night).Under this criterion the frequency is in the western industrial countries between 20-30 % in which about 10-15 % suffer under a very severe illness and 40 % of all depressions may be preceded by insomnia first.2. Narcolepsy is a genetic disorder and characterized by sleep onset REM sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.www.intechopen.comSleep Disorders 118 The exact prevalence of the general population is unknown.Great differences exist in its appearance frequency.So the frequency of Japan is 0.16 % and of Israel 0.0002 %.Central Europe (0.006 %) and the USA (0.06-0.1 %) are located in the middle.3. Sleep Apnea Syndromes (SAS) are common disorders, which are characterized by repeated oropharyngeal occlusions occurring during the sleep time (sleep-related breathing problems, intermittent hypoxemia) and may be associated with suppression of SWS sleep (disrupted and fragmentized sleep architecture).Due to intermittent hypoxemia and disrupted sleep architecture, SAS leads to impaired daytime functioning in various (neuro)psychological and affective domains and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, principally from adipositas, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.The prevalence of moderate SAS (AHI >15/h) is 9% in male and 4% in female, respectively.25-30 % Sleep Apnea Syndromes were described at patients with hypertension and 35-45 % with patients with on the left heart-failure.The SAS frequency increases with an advancing age and reaches their peak at the age from 50 to 70 years.80% of the patients suffer under excessive daytime sleepiness and a reduced sustained attention.Resulting from this it comes to performance losses both professional and in the ability to drive motor vehicles.Fragmentation of sleep and increased frequency of arousals occur in association with this three disorders and a number of other sleep disorders as well as with medical disorders involving physical pain or discomfort.In this chapter, the author will describe neuropsychological dysfunctions/courses and neuropsychiatric syndromes due sleep disorders which were characterized by 1. excessive daytime sleepiness 2. attention deficit, 3. memory dysfunction, 4. executive dysfunction, 5. driving difficulties, 6. motivation and emotional deficits, 7. psychiatric consequences (e.g.depression, anxiety) and 8. lack of ability to recognize the effects of behaviour.There are wide varieties of difficulties in assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and behavioural disability after sleep disorders.In our studies we used neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric methods in different patient groups in a sleep laboratory.Over the past five years we have been testing and treating more than 2000 patients with different sleep disorders and more than 5000 neurological patients.During admission to the clinic, all patients were selected according to their clinical diagnosis (ICD-10) and were examined neurologically, (neuro)psychologically, psychiatrically and medically.The test persons must not suffer from any severe psychiatric disorders.The study was carried out involving randomly selected patients with sleep disorders.

Disturbances observed later in life in animal and man, due to perinatal interference of such drugs with brain neurotransmitters and behavioral states, are not gross physical malformations but rather subtle behavioral and neurological symptoms such as hyperactivity, emotional lability, perceptual motor disturbances, attentional distractibility and sleep disturbances.",

Despite speech disorder and mind disruption, patients with severe dementia still have a psychic and relational life, which is expressed through BPSD. Many BPSD are of short duration and can be improved by a better understanding, psychological and behavioral approach. However, psychotropic drugs are often useful or necessary, but, due to the frailty of the patients with severe dementia, their use should be very cautious.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review To review the conceptual problems in distinguishing between undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome, for both may present with fatigue as the main symptom. Recent findings The differences and/or similarities between undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome have not been studied, conceptually or empirically. The literature fails to present discriminant validity of chronic fatigue syndrome in relation to undifferentiated somatoform disorder. A critical feature is implied in the definition of undifferentiated somatoform disorder but absent from the definitions of chronic fatigue syndrome: some patients experience their fatigue as being exclusively physical and not as mental, which is prima facie peculiar, for fatigue is necessarily a mental experience. One is not able to experience fatigue without a mind (or a brain). This experience is characterized as a ‘mindless’ fatigue, underpinned by pathological reductionist thinking. By not recognizing this critical feature, diagnostic endeavours may perpetuate the problem as a function of the patient's difficulty. Summary Proponents of chronic fatigue syndrome should distinguish chronic fatigue syndrome from undifferentiated somatoform disorder, if chronic fatigue syndrome is a distinct entity at all. Further, the ‘mindless’ quality is a critical feature that needs consideration in refining the concept of undifferentiated somatoform disorder.",

      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

      "abstract": "Recent research has shown that depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis are more common than previously supposed in elderly populations without dementia. It is unclear whether the frequency of these disorders increases or decreases with age. Clinical expression of psychiatric disorders in old age may be different from that seen in younger age groups, with less and often milder symptoms. Concurrently, comorbidity between different psychiatric disorders is immense, as well as comorbidity with somatic disorders. Cognitive function is often decreased in people with depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis, but whether these disorders are risk factors for dementia is unclear. Psychiatric disorders in the elderly are often related to cerebral neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease, although psychosocial risk factors are also important. Psychiatric disorders, common among the elderly, have consequences that include social deprivation, poor quality of life, cognitive decline, disability, increased risk for somatic disorders, suicide, and increased nonsuicidal mortality.",

      "abstract": "Distress is commonly characterized by prolonged internal suffering that can range from self-focused processing of negative emotions and stressors, to highly intensely aversive and prolonged emotional states thereby worsening or complicating emotional and physical conditions. Decentering represents a metacognitive capacity thought to reflect three interrelated processes: meta-awareness, disidentification from internal experience, and reduced reactivity to thought content—which is reliably increased with mindfulness-based interventions. In this essay, we seek to link the clinical presentation of distress disorders to known or hypothesized disruptions in neural networks that underlie emotion, cognition, and goal directed behavior, and offer a neurobehavioral account for how and why treatments imbued with mindfulness meditation might ameliorate these conditions, in part through increases in decentering.",

      "title": "Memory and Cognitive Functioning After Electroconvulsive Therapy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Several aspects of cerebral functioning can be affected for varying intervals by ECT, depending on the number, frequency, and duration of the induced seizures, the anatomical placement of the stimulating electrodes, and the stimulus wave-form, parameters, and charge. Depending on which particular combination of these variables they receive, patients during the immediate postictal period may experience confusion and neurological dysfunction that occasionally progresses to delirium. After the postictal confusion has cleared, two specific types of memory impairment can be demonstrated: retrograde amnesia for events preceding the seizure and anterograde amnesia (rapid forgetting) for events following it. Non-memory cognitive impairments may also be detectable in the interictal period using various modem neuropsychological procedures. Finally, patients may experience subjective memory dysfunction that may or may not be objectively confirmed. Studies of the various aspects of ECT-induced disruption of functioning naturally divide themselves into those conducted during the immediate postictal period before reorientation has occurred, those conducted after full alertness and orientation have been reestablished, and those conducted days, weeks, or months later.",

      "abstract": "Medically unexplained visual loss, or functional visual loss, or nonorganic visual loss (NOVL) denotes diminished visual acuity or field without discernible ocular or neurological pathology. Variously termed in the literature, it eludes organic diagnosis following a thorough examination. Symptoms range from mild blurriness to total blindness, sometimes presenting as tunnel vision or hemianopias. Diagnosis entails comprehensive eye evaluation to exclude organic causes like refractive error or cataracts. NOVL frequently correlates with psychological conditions like depression or anxiety, implicating psychological influence in its etiology. Thus, NOVL underscores the complex interplay between physical and psychological factors in visual impairment, necessitating holistic diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This chapter elucidates the diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms pertaining to functional visual disorder (FVD) or nonorganic vision loss (NOVL), prevalent presentations posing diagnostic challenges across diverse medical disciplines. It delineates the historical evolution of terminology denoting patients manifesting vision loss incongruous with established neurological or ophthalmic pathologies, necessitating a collaborative, interprofessional approach. Diagnostic modalities, ranging from meticulous ocular assessments to comprehensive psychological evaluations, reflect the intricate etiological spectrum underlying NOVL. This exposition serves as a pivotal reference for healthcare professionals navigating the diagnostic intricacies and therapeutic imperatives intrinsic to NOVL, advocating for a holistic, patient-centric approach underscored by scientific rigor, and compassionate care.",

      "title": "Neuropathic pain and diabetes",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a common phenomenon resulting from injury to the central or peripheral nervous system. The means by which diabetes results in nerve injury is unclear but the effect is to cause injury at all levels of the nervous system from the level of the peripheral nerves to the brain. Nerve injury causes pain through a cascade of mechanisms resulting in altered processing of sensory input into the nervous system. This alteration occurs through chemical and anatomical changes in the nervous system that are similar to some of the processes seen in central sensitisation following acute pain. Following nerve injury, neuropathic pain occurs not only when these mechanisms are activated but also when sensitisation is maintained. Other processes occurring in neuropathic pain appear to be a loss of normal inhibitory controls as seen by a reduction in local GABA-ergic and descending monoaminergic influences. There are also important changes mediated via glial cells that can maintain neuropathic pain. Diabetes affects all areas of the nervous system and the contribution of higher levels of the nervous system is often overlooked. Neurophysiological and MRI evidence strongly suggest that these may contribute to the pain of diabetic neuropathy. Psychological dysfunction in diabetic patients is an important factor in increasing the suffering associated with all aspects of the disease, but treatment and control of pain can greatly improve the quality of life.

      "title": "Mild cognitive impairment",
      "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndrome that spans the area between normal ageing and dementia. It is classified into amnestic and non-amnestic types, both with two subtypes: single domain and multiple domains. Prevalence of MCI depends on criteria and population and can vary from 0.1 to 42% persons of older age. In contrast to dementia, cognitive deterioration is less severe and activities of daily living are preserved. Most impaired higher cognitive functions in MCI are memory, executive functions, language, visuospatial functions, attention etc. Also there are depression, apathy or psychomotor agitation, and signs of psychosis. Aetiology of MCI is multiple, mostly neurodegenerative, vascular, psychiatric, internistic, neurological, traumatic and iatrogenic. Persons with amnestic MCI are at a higher risk of converting to Alzheimer's disease, while those with a single non-memory domain are at risk of developing frontotemporal dementia. Some MCI patients also progress to other dementia types, vascular among others. In contrast, some patients have a stationary course, some improve, while others even normalize. Every suspicion of MCI warrants a detailed clinical exploration to discover underlying aetiology, laboratory analyses, neuroimaging methods and some cases require a detailed neuropsychological assessment. At the present time there is no efficacious therapy for cognitive decline in MCI or the one that could postpone conversion to dementia. The treatment of curable causes, application of preventive measures and risk factor control are reasonable measures in the absence of specific therapy.",

Major variables that will be decisive also include the agreed-upon goals of treatment. The purpose in removing symptoms may include trying to prevent suicide, restoring work and interpersonal function, or enhancing the patient's capacity to participate in psychotherapy. The patient was in an agitated state, overwhelmed by fearful ruminations to the degree that he could not think clearly, or concentrate on anything including his psychotherapy, and had developed early waking insomnia.

Using sleep deprivation, we studied the extent to which age- and psychopathology-related sleep \"decay\" is reversible in aged normal, depressed, and demented subjects. Depression or probable Alzheimer's dementia compromised the augmentation of sleep continuity and SWS seen in healthy elderly following sleep deprivation. Rapid eye movement (REM) latency decreased during recovery sleep in the controls but increased in both patient groups. Compared with demented patients, depressed elderly had greater severity of sleep continuity disturbance both before and after sleep deprivation, a more protracted course of recovery sleep, and increased slow-wave density in the second non-REM (NREM) sleep period (during recovery). The REM sleep time was diminished in dementia compared with depression both at baseline and during recovery sleep. These differential effects of age, health, and neuropsychiatric disease on recovery from sleep loss are relevant to recovery or reversal theories of sleep and have implications for daytime well-being in the elderly.",

Patients who receive treatment without diagnosis tend to be older, established patients with established diagnoses who see the physician for a shorter visit and are more likely to have a follow-up appointment.

Multiple factors, such as neurobiologic mechanisms underlying sleep disturbances and dementia, primary sleep disorders, long-term care environments, and physical and mental health conditions are associated with sleep disturbances. In older adults with dementia, these disturbances negatively affect their health, quality of life and medical expenses. As a result, these adults may require placement in a long-term care institution, and their caregivers' health may be adversely affected. Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions may alleviate the symptoms associated with sleep disturbances. However, nonpharmacologic interventions, particularly when combined, have been shown to be more effective than pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of sleep disturbances in older adults with dementia.",

They may induce euphoria and analgesia, which cultures have sought for generations when administered abruptly. Chronic opioid usage alters neural circuitry and creates a drug-dependent condition. During drug withdrawal, allostatic alterations caused by drug dependence are evident. Drug use stops a temporary coordinated allostatic re-established of neural circuits, which manifest as physiology and psychological consequences that are the opposite of those seen throughout sensitive drug intoxicates. Physical withdrawal symptoms, for example, go away in a matter of days, although other symptoms, such as dysphoria, sleeplessness, and anxiety, might last. Some adaptations, like gathered connections, can become permanent. The brain circuitry, cellular processes, and opioids drug dependence suggest a potential role for neuroinflammation. The taught association involving opioids and alleviation from a preexisting or withdrawal-induced anxiogenic and dysphoric state leads to opioids-addicted behaviors. Drug cravings among susceptible persons living in an increasingly pressured environment would be fueled by a taught link between drug use and respite from unpleasant moods. We contend that the present opioids crisis in the USA is exacerbated by this path to addiction.",

      "abstract": "A strong perception exists that elderly people are at risk for persistent cognitive deterioration lasting longer than six months following major surgery, particularly heart surgery. Furthermore, based on laboratory evidence, investigators hypothesize that surgery or anesthesia might precipitate incident dementia. Recent clinical studies have found that cognition might frequently be impaired within the first few months postoperatively, and that such impairment may be associated with death or debility. Unsurprisingly, the specter of cognitive decline or dementia following surgery is a source of consternation to elderly people and their families. However, there are methodological concerns relating to the investigation of postoperative cognitive decline. Studies have been hampered by lack of standard diagnostic criteria for cognitive decline, by the use of statistical rather than clinical definitions, by poorly matched controls or even the absence of controls, and by inadequate detection of preexisting mild dementia. For these reasons, there are ongoing controversies surrounding the time course, the severity, and even the clinical relevance of persistent postoperative cognitive deterioration. There is evidence that most patients recover cognition in the long-term, and that for those who experience persistent decline, this is probably attributable to underlying undiagnosed neurological disease or other co-morbidities rather than to surgery or to anesthesia. There is currently minimal clinical evidence linking surgery or anesthesia to incident dementia. Rigorous clinical research is needed to resolve the controversy whether anesthesia or surgery is likely to cause persistent neurological decline or to precipitate dementia.",

      "abstract": "Depression and dementia are frequent illnesses more so in older population and can occur together. There are several shared etiological factors and can also be risk factors for each other. Neuroendocrine mechanisms, especially those mediated by corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) induce increased activity of hypothalamo-hypophyseo-adrenal axis that produce hypercortisolaemia which damage hippocampus and other cortical areas leading to reduction of cognitive reserve and possibly also to dementia, and in chronic stress leads to arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis that are independent risk factors for dementia. Vascular factors damage brain and according to localization can produce depression and/or dementia and are potentially treatable. Influence of inflammatory processes in the brain mediated by cytokines can act or via CRF system or directly upon various brain structures. Cytokines are also connected to noradrenergic and serotoninergic systems that are of importance in development of dementia. Timely implementation of antidepressive therapy is very important cause it precludes progression of organic brain injury and improves the life quality both in nondemented and demented patients.",

It is possible to arrange a list of these conditions, not necessarily complete, under three basic headings for the purpose of description: subcultural defects, instability defects and somatic defects. Subcultural defectives are characterized by intellectual inadequacy paralleled by a lower level of social development; unstable defectives are characterized by abnormal rather than subnormal conduct and may be of the psychopathic, the epileptic or the exogenous type. Somatic defects are distinguished ordinarily",

      "title": "Contribution of methotrexate in precipitation of manic episode in bipolar affective disorder explored: a case report",
      "abstract": "Bipolar affective disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of mania with or without, but commonly with, episodes of depression. It usually begins in adolescence and can cause enduring and substantial impairment if left untreated. It needs a long-term treatment with mood stabilizers to prevent relapses. Elevated or depressed mood relapses can be either primary or secondary. However, primary mood relapses can occur without a significant precipitating factor, more often tending to occur following stressful life events or discontinuation of mood stabilizer medications. Secondary mood relapses can be caused by many conditions, such as physical illnesses, substance misuse and medications. When a mental illness coexists with another physical illness and the treatment of one complicates the other, it adds complexity to the selection of appropriate pharmacological regime for either condition. In this paper, the authors present a case of bipolar affective disorder who had two episodes of mania likely precipitated by methotrexate, which were reversed by the withdrawal of the offending drug (methotrexate). To the best of the authors' knowledge, to date there have been no published reports in the literature in which methotrexate, an immunosuppressive and a cytotoxic drug, precipitated a manic episode in a patient with bipolar affective disorder.",

      "title": "Stress and immunity: minireview.",
      "abstract": "Stress, a state of threatened homeostasis, may be induced by various physical or psychological factors (stressors), including antigenic stimulation. Stressful experiences may affect both physical/psychological well being and immune functioning of humans and animals; the ongoing immune reaction may affect other physiological functions and psychological comfort. The molecular basis of these effects involves a network of multidirectional signalling and feedback regulations of neuroendocrine- and immunocyte-derived mediators. The consecutive stages of the multistep immune reactions might be either inhibited or enhanced owing to the previous and/or parallel stress experiences, depending on the kind of stressor and the animal species, strain, gender, or age. Therefore, the final results of stress-induced alteration of immune reactions are difficult to predict. The effect of a particular stressor on immune functions varies according to the previous stress experience of the individual (e.g. social confrontation, sterile saline injection) while various stressors may act in the same or in opposite ways on the same immune parameter. In general, the efficacy of immune response depends on the neuroendocrine environment on which it is superimposed. Conversely, neural and endocrine responses depend on the concurrent immune events upon which they are superimposed. It seems that the consequences of stress on the immune functioning are generally adaptive in the short run but can be damaging when stress is chronic.",

      "abstract": "For decades, psychostimulants have been the gold standard pharmaceutical treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In the United States, an astounding 9% of all boys and 4% of girls will be prescribed stimulant drugs at some point during their childhood. Recent meta-analyses have revealed that individuals with ADHD have reduced brain volume loss later in life (>60 y.o.) compared to the normal aging brain, which suggests that either ADHD or its treatment may be neuroprotective. Crucially, these neuroprotective effects were significant in brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala) where severe volume loss is linked to cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Historically, the ADHD diagnosis and its pharmacotherapy came about nearly simultaneously, making it difficult to evaluate their effects in isolation. Certain evidence suggests that psychostimulants may normalize structural brain changes typically observed in the ADHD brain. If ADHD itself is neuroprotective, perhaps exercising the brain, then psychostimulants may not be recommended across the lifespan. Alternatively, if stimulant drugs are neuroprotective, then this class of medications may warrant further investigation for their therapeutic effects. Here, we take a bottom-up holistic approach to review the psychopharmacology of ADHD in the context of recent models of attention. We suggest that future studies are greatly needed to better appreciate the interactions amongst an ADHD diagnosis, stimulant treatment across the lifespan, and structure-function alterations in the aging brain.",

      "title": "Chronic neurocognitive effects of critical illness",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review Until relatively recently critical care practitioners have focused on survival of their patients and not long-term outcomes. An increasing body of research has examined patient outcomes beyond discharge from the intensive care unit and hospital. One area of focus is neurobehavioral outcomes including neurocognitive sequelae and neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Cognitive functions are brain-based or mental activities that involve acquiring, storing, retrieving, and using information and include domains such as memory, attention, executive function, mental processing speed, spatial abilities, and general intelligence. It is known from other medical specialties that impaired cognitive function can have a broad, substantial, and long-lasting impact on a patient's life. This paper examines the current evidence for neurocognitive impairments in survivors of critical illness. Recent findings Recent studies support the hypothesis that critical illness can lead to significant impairments in neurocognitive function. Current work indicates that the neurocognitive impairments can last for months or years after a patient arrives home and may have important consequences for quality of individual and family life and for ability to return to work as well as substantial economic costs. The mechanisms of neurocognitive impairments are not fully understood, but in acute respiratory distress syndrome hypoxemic burden appears important. Summary Among the potential consequences of critical illness are now included neurocognitive impairments. Future research should include the search for strategies for the early identification of neurocognitive impairments, mechanisms of brain injury, and therapeutic modalities designed to prevent or decrease neurocognitive morbidity.",

When these appear in the setting of psychiatric illnesses, the association is easy to recognize but the treatment remains a difficult problem. However, in other situations the diagnosis may be missed for extended periods of time, resulting in unnecessary diagnostic work-up and inappropriate therapy. The diagnosis depends on a compulsive drug history not only from the patient but also from patient's family, primary physician, and the pharmacist.

In Alzheimer's patients with FTT, the thrust of treatment is the identification and treatment of the medical and psychiatric comorbidities and the appropriate titration of environmental supports.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An adverse effect is an unwanted effect of a drug. Adverse effects can be due to either toxic effects or side effects. A toxic effect is an adverse effect that arises through an exaggeration of the same pharmacological effect that is responsible for the therapeutic effect of the drug, for example hypokalaemia due to diuretic therapy, and is therefore dose related. A side effect is an adverse effect that arises through some pharmacological action other than that which produces the therapeutic effect; such effects may be dose related (for example anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants) or not dose related (for example a rash associated with an antibiotic). Because dose-related side effects can also be regarded as toxic effects, it is better to avoid the terms ‘toxic effects’ and ‘side effects’ and to use instead the term ‘adverse effects’, which covers all types of unwanted effects.",

In later life, insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common. Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described. Good sleep should be understood as a substrate for psychological health and a reasonable expectation in later life.",

This paper reviews research into long-term effects on cognition which are likely to represent neurotoxicity. Research is hampered by numerous confounds and methodological difficulties. With recent cannabis use there is both an acute and a residual effect on cognition, making it important to have a significant abstinence period from cannabis when studying effects of MDMA in recreational users of both substances. It would appear that MDMA does indeed have subtle long-term effects on complex memory and executive functions that are independent of cannabis and may remain with abstention. This is consistent with evidence of disruption of the serotonin system in animal and human studies. Chronic effects on cognition due to cannabis are less consistently demonstrated, but more sensitive tests including electrophysiological measures have revealed long-term deficits in attention.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may present neuropsychiatric and conduct disorders at different stages of the development of the disease that make treatment even more difficult. Development The neurologist must be on the lookout for the possible appearance of alterations affecting impulse control, even from the early stages of the disease, so as to be able to prevent them or to plan a suitable adjustment of treatment. Some of the most common impulsivity disorders include hypersexuality, compulsive gambling and other addictive behaviours which, if left undetected and untreated, can end up having a destructive effect on the patient's socio-familial surroundings. Psychotic disorders (hallucinations, delusions) are often associated to advanced phases of PD and to the effect of dopamine therapy, and they are associated to a higher morbidity and mortality rate. Factors of a genetic or pharmacogenetic nature or a gene-environment interaction may account for the different individual susceptibility to disorders in the neuropsychiatric realm among patients with PD. It is wise to bear in mind the possible medico-legal implications that may stem from behavioral disorders, both for the patient and his or her family and for the physician, because situations could arise that trigger conflicts between confidentiality and preventing third parties from being harmed, as well as harm that can be attributed to the side effects of medicines. Conclusions The specialist must be familiar with, foresee and propose suitable treatment for behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders in PD with potential medico-legal implications.",

      "abstract": "Generally, dementia is a long-lasting and gradual process. While the body often remains strong for a number of years, mental capacities as well as the accumulated competencies and memories of a lifetime gradually slip away. Late stage symptoms include an inability to recognize familiar objects, surroundings, or people, increasing physical frailty, difficulties in eating and swallowing, weight loss, incontinence, and gradual loss of speech and movement control. Reflexes become abnormal and muscles grow rigid. In the end stage, people with dementia lie in bed in a foetus-like position seemingly living as a vegetative organism, being totally dependent on the care of others. This chapter focuses on people with severe dementia, answering the question of what supportive care could contribute to the well-being of these people. It argues that people with severe dementia cannot entirely be denied a (rudimentary) form of selfhood or personhood. They definitively are not persons in the strict sense of moral agents who are self-conscious and rational and demonstrate a minimal moral sense, but at least they can be called persons in a weaker sense.",

      "abstract": "Poor maternal mental health in pregnancy and postnatally has an obvious negative impact on the mother but may also adversely affect the child and the wider family. The treatment of severe mental illness during this period can be complicated by several factors: the potential for adverse effects of medication on the foetus or breastfed infant; the reduced acceptability of even low levels of risk; the reduced tolerability of adverse effects for women at this critical and demanding time in their lives; the potential for deterioration into extremely severe and high risk illness, particularly postnatally and its rapidity; and the urgency required for achieving recovery to reduce the risk of long term consequences for both mother and child. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), as an alternative or adjunctive treatment for severe perinatal mental illness, may offer some patients fewer such disadvantages than medication or psychological therapies, alone or in combination. The indications for ECT in the perinatal period are the same as those in a non-perinatal population. It has been suggested ECT is not considered often enough in the perinatal period (Focht & Kellner 2012). NICE guidelines state ECT should be considered for pregnant women with severe depression, severe mixed affective states or mania, or catatonia, whose physical health or that of the foetus is at serious risk (NICE 2015). There are no prospective randomised control trials assessing the risk and benefit of ECT in the perinatal population but retrospective data have been collected that can help us evaluate whether ECT is both an effective and safe treatment option.",

      "abstract": "Management of insomnia : drug approach The prescription of a hypnotic can be proposed in transient acute insomnia, but only for a short period and in this indication only. Chronic insomnia disorder is not an indication. The gold standard treatment for this disorder is cognitive and behavioral therapy. The prescription of a hypnotic should not be trivialized and is part of a short-term strategy. In the long term, hypnotics have poor effect on sleep duration, have side effects (excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired memory or attention, risk of falls and accidents), and have a high risk of dependence. The modalities of discontinuation of hypnotic treatments are to be anticipated with the patient as soon as the prescription is initiated. The discontinuation will be done by a gradual decrease of the doses to avoid a rebound effect at the end of the 4 weeks of prescriptions. In the context of chronic consumption of hypnotics, a strategy of discontinuation has to be proposed at any request for renewal of hypnotics. The decision must be discussed and considered with the patient during a shared decision-making process. Implementation requires precise evaluation of the severity of insomnia, the presence of a hypnotic dependence and the presence of a comorbid psychiatric disorder.Prise en charge de l’insomnie : approche médicamenteuse La prescription d’un hypnotique est envisageable dans l’insomnie aiguë transitoire, mais seulement sur une courte période et dans cette seule indication. Le trouble d’insomnie chronique n’est pas une indication et le traitement de référence dans ce cadre est la thérapie cognitive et comportementale. La prescription d’un hypnotique ne doit pas être banalisée et s’inscrit dans une stratégie à court terme. Au long cours, les hypnotiques ont une faible efficacité sur la durée de sommeil, des effets délétères (somnolence diurne excessive, altération de la mémoire ou de la concentration, risque de chute et d’accident), et un risque fort de dépendance. Les modalités d’arrêt des traitements hypnotiques sont à anticiper avec le patient dès la prescription initiale. L’arrêt se fera par une diminution progressive des doses pour éviter un effet rebond à la fin des 4 semaines de prescription. Dans le cadre d’une consommation chronique d’hypnotiques, une stratégie d’arrêt est à proposer devant toute demande de renouvellement d’hypnotiques. L’arrêt doit être discuté et envisagé avec le patient au cours d’un processus de décision partagée. La mise en place nécessite d’évaluer précisément la sévérité de l’insomnie, la présence d’une dépendance aux hypnotiques et la présence d’un trouble psychiatrique comorbide.",

      "abstract": "The clinical diagnosis of neurological disease requires a particularly detailed analysis of patients' symptoms. This is partly because the nervous system is a communications system with direct access to consciousness, so that the patient is in a unique position to monitor his own disorder. Clinical diagnosis becomes very difficult in the presence of dysphasia, confusion or dementia. Another reason is that useful biochemical and histological information about the function of neurons is rarely available, in contrast to the wealth of data used in the assessment of diseases of other organs, such as the lungs, liver or kidneys. The failure of neurons in the CNS to regenerate means that delay in making a precise diagnosis can worsen the eventual outcome; the clinician often cannot afford to watch how an illness progresses before intervening.",

      "title": "Long‐Acting Injectables: A Strategy to Mitigate Nonadherence in Bipolar Disorder",
      "abstract": "Despite our best efforts, partial or nonadherence to treatment is common in bipolar disorder. Varying definitions of nonadherence make a clear prevalence difficult to determine, but a recent nationwide bipolar disorder cohort study identified rates of nonadherence to treatment to be as high as 60%, with a mean prevalence of 40% [1]. The study included > 33,000 individuals with bipolar disorder, and approximately 60% were nonadherent at least once during the monitoring period. This begs the question, why? Nonadherence to pharmacologic treatment is not unique to bipolar disorder, but rates are notoriously high in mental health conditions. Reasons are multifactorial but include the number of comorbidities, young age, co-occurring substance use disorders, limited primary support system, psychotic symptoms, intensity of manic symptoms, and limited insight, amongst others [1, 2]. The consequence of nonadherence to treatment, especially in early disease bipolar disorder, can be dire. Manic exacerbations have been shown to result in brain damage, functional and cognitive impairment, and worse outcomes [3, 4]. Additionally, potentially due to increased impulsivity, bipolar disorder is strongly associated with increased loss of life due to suicide. The best way to prevent these exacerbations and deleterious outcomes is by maintaining adherence to efficacious treatment, thereby preserving brain function and quality of life. In a recent article published in bipolar disorders, Vieta and colleagues expound on the landscape of long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics for the treatment of bipolar disorder and provide expert consensus recommendations [4]. Key findings include moving past the preconceived notion that LAIs can be used only for bipolar disorder patients with severe disease, and utilizing LAIs as early as possible in the bipolar disease course, ideally during the first manic episode [4]. Historically, LAIs have been reserved for patients with chronic nonadherence to treatment and schizophrenia. However, robust evidence supports that LAIs can enhance fidelity to treatment, reduce psychotic and manic exacerbations, and reduce the risk of rehospitalization when compared to oral antipsychotics [4]. Bipolar 1 disorder can be difficult to treat, and individuals will often require multiple medications. However, polypharmacy has also been shown to reduce adherence [1]. LAIs can lower this burden by limiting the number of daily medications, providing consistent medication serum levels, and eliminating the guesswork about treatment adherence status. Using an LAI as the core treatment allows for rational polypharmacy and the utilization of other medications, such as lithium, in a synergistic manner. However, individuals are often not given the option of an LAI due to lack of healthcare provider awareness. In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the availability of LAI antipsychotic medications, with several new formulations having been brought to market and others in advanced clinical development. These new formulations have varying \"amenities of care,\" allowing the patient and provider to individualize treatment. Options to consider include the following: method of administration (intramuscular versus subcutaneous), injection intervals (ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months), injection sites, number of initiation doses, duration of oral antipsychotic supplementation, needle size, injection volume, prefilled syringe, dose strength, and approved indication, amongst others [5, 6]. Whether a patient will be receptive towards receiving an LAI depends on how the option is communicated, and LAIs should not be considered as a punitive treatment [6]. If considering an antipsychotic medication for bipolar disorder, LAIs should be offered during the initial treatment discussion, normalizing their use in the early management of bipolar disorder. Moreover, discussing LAIs early in the bipolar disease course can reduce stigma and the perception that it should only be used as a \"last resort.\" As part of shared decision-making, the initial conversation should discuss potential benefits and drawbacks of LAIs and what the patient's treatment goals are. Moreover, providers should take the time to review the expanding list of available LAI formulations. Identifying what an individual values most in a medication, ranging from the tolerability profile to dosing frequency, can enhance the collaborative nature of treatment, strengthen the therapeutic alliance, and optimize care. If an LAI antipsychotic is selected, the various amenities of care should be adequately discussed. However, practical limitations and obstacles to LAIs also exist, such as reimbursement barriers and the impact of telehealth from COVID-19. As several LAIs are new, insurers may be reluctant to authorize coverage, and if an individual is uninsured, identifying applicable patient-assistance programs will be needed. Additionally, with the rise of telehealth, healthcare providers are often seeing their patients virtually, making administering an LAI logistically challenging. Being aware of community resources, such as pharmacies and clinics able to administer injectables, will be necessary. Nonadherence to treatment is high in bipolar disorder. LAIs are an underutilized pharmacologic option with evidence supporting their efficacy and role in maintaining fidelity to treatment. As their utilization increases and research grows, their inclusion in treatment guidelines is likely to follow [4]. Justin Faden: Grant support — BioXcel Therapeutics.

      "title": "PTSD, DEMENTIA, AND SLEEP DISORDER: A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: A recent article in this journal described three World War II veterans with cognitive impairment who presented with symptoms suggestive of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).1 The nature and type of dementia in these patients was not specified. Fluctuating cognition is one of the three major diagnostic criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Fluctuations are described as marked variation in a patient's cognitive or functional abilities or periods of confusion or decreased responsiveness alternating with reasonable lucidity. While identification of fluctuations is difficult, two of the reported patients had episodes of confusion and withdrawal suggestive of fluctuations. Other core features of DLB include recurrent visual hallucinations and spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism.2 The presence of any one criterion is required for a diagnosis of possible DLB, and two or more criteria are required to make a diagnosis of probable DLB. The clinical histories do not mention the presence of visual hallucinations or neuroleptic sensitivity, and the neurological examination was not reported in sufficient detail to ascertain whether these patients might have had features of parkinsonism. All three patients were diagnosed with depression before the onset of their symptoms. All also suffered from paranoid delusions. Delusions and other behavioral disturbances, while seen in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are not common presenting symptoms. Delusions are one of the supportive features of DLB. We have recently reported the validity of the proposed clinical criteria for DLB in our clinical-pathological series.3 We found that whereas delusions had high specificity (91%) in cases with mild to moderate dementia, it had low sensitivity in the diagnosis of DLB (38%). A combination of any three major or minor clinical criteria had the best predictive value (75%) in mild to moderate disease. A subjective disturbance of sleep, including the occurrence of repetitive, stereotypical anxiety dreams, is characteristic of PTSD.4-6 The phenomenology of the PTSD anxiety dream has seemed most consistent with an underlying rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dysfunction.4, 5 Whereas near total paralysis is characteristic of the REM phase of sleep, motor activity is common in the sleep disorder seen in PTSD.6 REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a recently described parasomnia characterized by excessive and elaborate motor activities during sleep and is associated with pathological absence of muscle atonia during REM sleep. The relationship between sleep disturbances in PTSD and RBD needs further research. However, the identification of RBD-like signs in PTSD, in previous cases as well as in this series, adds to the evidence for a fundamental disturbance of REM sleep mechanisms in PTSD.4-6 Other reports have described patients with RBD presenting with or subsequently developing cognitive impairment.7, 8 Most of these patients also meet criteria for possible or probable DLB. The pattern of cognitive differences from AD in these patients with RBD and dementia is similar to reported comparisons between DLB and AD. A recent international workshop on criteria for DLB has recommended including depression and RBD as additional supportive features for the diagnosis of DLB.9 The clinical features in these patients suggest a diagnosis of possible or probable DLB. The clinical descriptions do not have features typical of other common types of dementia, such as AD or vascular dementia. It is possible that in some patients PSTD and/or RBD may either herald or present with cognitive impairment, which may subsequently evolve into DLB. Further studies with longitudinal assessments will be required to address this issue. Additional investigations utilizing as polysomnography, sleep questionnaires, and detailed neuropsychological assessments may also help in this regard. The finding of a specific disturbance of sleep unique to PTSD has significant therapeutic implications and also contributes to a better understanding of the nature of the dementia associated with the cases reported.

      "title": "Therapeutic effectiveness and patient acceptance of a vestibular nerve activation intervention in chronic insomnia",
      "abstract": "Defined as: “Complaints of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep”, insomnia is one of the most common presenting symptoms in the primary care setting [1, 2]. The disturbance may consist of one or more of three features:• difficulty in initiating sleep• difficulty in maintaining sleep• waking up too early [3].Insomnia can have a serious impact on work performance and maintaining healthy social relationships [4]. Chronic insomnia is differentiated from acute insomnia by individuals experiencing at least one of the symptoms described above for a minimum of 30 days [3]. Predictably, there has been a wealth of research in the areas of assessment and treatment for this sleep disorder, given the impact insomnia has been shown to have on mental and physical health and wellbeing [3-5]. Incidence rates are routinely around 9% of the general population, escalating to 30% for those who report occasional suffering [6]. Many individuals continue to report symptoms of insomnia for many years after initial onset [7]. Areas of particular interest to clinicians, health-care professionals and insomnia sufferers include implementation, acceptance and adherence to therapies that provide effective long-term management. Conventional treatments include prescription medications (sedative-hypnotics), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other alternative therapies (e.g. alcohol, herbal remedies and off-label use of other medicines) [3]. While sedative-hypnotics and CBT have been shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia [3,8], expert opinion counsels against long-term use of sedative-hypnotics due to residual sedation, rebound insomnia, memory impairment, dependency and withdrawal difficulties [9, 10]. In addition, CBT is not easily accessed and patients frequently have difficulty adhering to the strict behavioral program that is typically prescribed [11]. A further area of concern is the limited evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of alternative therapies, despite their widespread use [3].One promising approach to managing chronic insomnia is non-invasive mechanical vestibular nerve stimulation, which has been demonstrated to affect sleep [12-17]. The vestibular apparatus, in conjunction with visual and proprioceptive inputs, is responsible for maintaining balance under all conditions. Previous studies have used a mechanical rocking motion to induce vestibular activation, mimicking the sensation of infants being comforted by their parents. Improvements in sleep architecture and increased Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency, Rapid Eye Movement and decreased Sleep Onset Latency have been demonstrated when using this technique [12-17]. A unique therapy, designed to non-invasively stimulate the vestibular nerve to promote sleep onset, has recently been developed. As an alternative to the rocking motion delivered by mechanical action, a swaying sensation is artificially created through mild electrical stimulation. Clinical studies have been previously conducted to investigate both the safety and efficacy of this medical device for the treatment of insomnia via a transient insomnia model, with positive outcomes [18, 19]. Individuals with chronic insomnia report similar issues in sleep disturbance to those in transient insomnia, but persistent in nature. Given the limitations of current effective therapies, and the recent emphasis on patient-centered care [20], there is an increasing need for an alternative treatment for insomnia symptoms. It has been shown that patient preference for non-pharmacological treatment was over three times greater than prescription medications [21]. Thus many would prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach if an effective one were available [11]. Vestibular nerve activation may provide such a treatment for chronic insomnia.",

      "title": "Evaluation of Ataxia",
      "abstract": "Ataxia, defined as impaired coordination of movement and balance, is associated with dysfunction of the cerebellum or the sensory or motor pathways connecting to it. The causes of ataxia range from a transient parainfectious process to a progressive degenerative neurologic condition. The challenge for the pediatrician is to distinguish among the possible etiologies.The evaluation of ataxia begins with a thorough history and careful neurodevelopmental examination. The history must include the onset and duration of the symptom; family history of migraine or neurologic disease; recent infection, seizure, or head injury; and possible environmental exposure to heavy metals, gases, solvents, or medications. It is important to ask about other signs and symptoms, such as headache, vomiting, photophobia,vertigo, and altered mental status.Distinguishing whether a young child has age-appropriate clumsiness or is truly ataxic requires familiarity with the developmental milestones related to coordinated movements. Ataxia also must be distinguished from other disorders of the nervous system or of the muscles. The child should be examined in an upright position with attention to mental status, balance, presence of nystagmus, deep tendon reflexes, and muscle tone and strength. Muscle weakness from a myopathy or neuropathy may present with an altered gait and unstable balance, but it should be recognized on the basis of diminished muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes. Conversely, children who have spasticity may exhibit an unsteady,narrow-based gait, but they will demonstrate increased muscle tone and brisk reflexes. Movement disorders such as chorea and myoclonus, unlike ataxia,are evident even when the child is at rest.The examiner must look for evidence of increased intracranial pressure or infection by checking for abnormal vital signs, meningismus, and papilledema. With a patient is old enough to cooperate, the neurologic examination should evaluate cranial nerve function,heel-to-knee movement, finger-to-nose movement, tandem gait, rapid alternating movement, and speech. It is particularly important to listen for dysarthria,specifically the scanning speech pattern associated with cerebellar dysfunction. Dysfunction of the cerebellar vermis presents with truncal ataxia—imbalance in the sitting position and head titubation. Dysfunction of the cerebellar hemispheres presents with a gait that veers toward the involved side and dysmetria of the ipsilateral extremity. Attenuation of sensory input because of peripheral nerve or posterior column damage leads to a careful high-stepping gait and a positive Romberg sign. Children who have sensory ataxia have problems with fine finger movements rather than dysmetria.A typical presentation of acute ataxia is the sudden onset of a wide-based gait, with swerving and unsteadiness that is recognized easily by parent and physician. The most common causes are drug ingestion and postinfectious cerebellitis. The differential diagnosis includes head trauma, vascular events, brain tumor, hydrocephalus, the Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barrésyndrome (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and areflexia), labyrinthitis, seizure, and conversion reaction. Drugs associated with ataxia include phenytoin,carbamazepine, sedatives, hypnotics, and phencyclidine. Intoxication with alcohol, ethylene glycol, hydrocarbon fumes,lead, mercury, or thallium also may present with ataxia. A variety of pathogens can cause postinfectious cerebellitis, but it is observed most frequently after varicella.The evaluation of the child who has acute ataxia is based on the history and findings on physical examination, but it also should include a complete blood count, measurement of electrolytes,toxicologic screening of blood and urine, brain imaging, and lumbar puncture. If magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography demonstrates a mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or other intracranial abnormality, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation may be deferred. The presence of cells in the CSF may indicate infection, and elevated CSF protein levels are seen with Guillain-Barrésyndrome and multiple sclerosis. Ataxia, especially if accompanied by opsoclonus or myoclonus (“dancing eyes, dancing feet”), can be associated with neuroblastoma. If this diagnosis is suspected, examination of urine for vanillylmandelic acid/homovanillac acid(VMA/HVA) and imaging of the chest and abdomen are recommended.If the initial evaluation fails to establish a diagnosis, what appears to be acute ataxia actually may be the initial presentation of a more chronic process. Basilar migraine, seizure, and some rare metabolic disorders (Hartnup disease,maple syrup urine disease, pyruvate decarboxylase deficiency) may manifest with acute intermittent episodes of ataxia. Evaluation again is based on the history, but it may include brain imaging, electroencephalography, and electromyography. If metabolic disease is suspected, evaluation of amino acids,acid/base balance, lactate, pyruvate,ammonia, and ketones may be helpful.The slow evolution of ataxia in a previously healthy child warrants rapid evaluation. The most common causes of progressive ataxia are brain tumors(medulloblastoma, cerebellar astrocytoma,brain stem glioma, ependymoma)and degenerative spinocerebellar diseases, some of which present in infancy and others of which are delayed in onset until adulthood. Friedreich ataxia,an autosomal recessive disorder linked to a defect on chromosome 9, presents in the first decade of life with ataxia,pes cavus, scoliosis, and areflexia. Ataxia telangiectasia, also autosomal recessive, is marked by an abnormality on the long arm of chromosome 11 and is characterized by progressive truncal ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias,and recurrent infections of the sinuses and lungs. If magnetic resonance imaging of a child who has progressive ataxia fails to disclose an intracranial mass, referral for a detailed metabolic and genetic evaluation is warranted.In summary, ataxia may represent a benign, transient condition or a progressive, devastating neurologic disorder. As is usually true, a careful history and physical examination, followed by a focused radiologic and laboratory assessment, most often will lead to the proper diagnosis and intervention.As a disorder of coordination that depends on sensory,proprioceptive, motor, and integrative neural activities, ataxia can reflect dysfunction at virtually any level of the nervous system, not just the cerebellum. It also can be difficult to distinguish between ataxia and weakness when a child presents with, for example, an abnormal gait, and the differential diagnosis,although related, is not the same. Ataxia is particularly frightening because it represents a loss of physical control for the patient, and it poses some very nasty possibilities for the pediatrician. Clinical medicine is not easy, but it is less difficult if we go back to the basics,with a careful history and physical examination. It’s amazing how often we can get to the answer without magnetic resonance imaging.",

Many disorders which cause cognitive impairment, such as drug toxicity and depression, fail to meet diagnostic criteria for dementia. These tend to have the best prognosis. Studies of the neuropsychiatric syndromes associated with disorders causing potentially reversible dementias suggest that dementia is an infrequent outcome and when it does occur, few cases recover. Factors predictive of improvement are short duration of symptoms and mild degree of cognitive impairment, usually subcortical in type. It is suggested that potentially reversible cognitive impairment would be a more accurate term as many cases are due to delirium and depression. While cases of well established dementia do not require extensive investigation, all cases should have a thorough clinical assessment as in many instances dual pathology exists and all require psychosocial management.",

Accurate diagnosis is essential to guide management, in particular, treatment options, any genetic implications, and prognosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the family prototype and is a diffuse neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both upper and lower motor neuron cell death, causing progressive paralysis of limb, bulbar (speech and swallowing) and respiratory muscles, and resulting in death from respiratory failure. The cardinal clinical feature of combined upper and lower motor neuron signs in various body regions (bulbar, arms, trunk, legs) forms the basis for diagnostic criteria. There is no cure and the disease progresses relentlessly, with few patients surviving beyond 5 years from symptom onset.",

      "title": "Therapeutic recommendations for management of severe hyponatremia: current concepts on pathogenesis and prevention of neurologic complications.",
      "abstract": "Patients with hyponatremia are exposed to major neurological complications. On the one hand hyponatremia itself produces brain edema, increased intracranial pressure which potentially leads to subsequent neuropathological sequelae or death. On the other hand excessive correction could be followed by development of brain demyelinating lesions (central pontine or extrapontine myelinolysis) with major disability or fatal outcome. Understanding of brain adaptative mechanisms to changes in osmolality largely contributes to explain these neurological events. When serum sodium decreases, the brain prevents swelling by extruding electrolytes and organic osmolytes, a process almost fully achieved after 48 h. Conversely, during subsequent increase in serum sodium, reestablishment of intracerebral osmolytes occurs but their reuptake is more delayed (+/- 5 days). In both circumstances, these mechanisms can be overwhelmed, leading to brain damage. Acute hyponatremia (< 48 h) is generally hospital-acquired, mainly in the postoperative state and/or after excessive fluid administration. After abrupt fall in serum sodium, seizure, respiratory arrest and coma may develop and these manifestations are sometimes explosive in nature. Recognition of even minor symptoms is crucial and implies prompt correction. There is generally no risk of brain myelinolysis in acute hyponatremia. Some factors are suspected to aggravate the prognosis of hyponatremic encephalopathy, including female gender (menstruant women), hypoxia and young age. Chronic hyponatremia (> 48 h) usually develops outside the hospital and is generally better tolerated. The risks of brain myelinolysis can be largely reduced by limiting the correction level to < or = 15 mEq/1/24 h. However, if necessary, the initial rate of correction can be rapid provided that the final correction remains < 15 mEq/1/24 h. However, when other recognized risk factors for myelinolysis (hypokalemia, liver disease, poor nutritional state, burns) are present, correction should not exceed 10 mEq/1/24 h. Demyelinization is also observed in hypernatremia but it follows greater (50%) increase in serum sodium than from hyponatremic baseline. For symptomatic hyponatremia, rapid correction is usually obtained by hypertonic saline (3%) infusion. Another option consists in administration of intravenous or oral urea. Urea allows a rapid reduction of brain edema and intracranial pressure which is followed by subsequent correction of hyponatremia. Experimental data also suggest that treatment of hyponatremia with urea is associated with a lower incidence of myelinolysis. In hyponatremic patients without symptoms, there is no need for rapid correction and the treatment should be more conservative. Close monitoring of the serum sodium is indicated initially and if necessary, correction must be stopped and diuresis interrupted with dDAVP. Given recent experimental data, in patients overly corrected (delta SNa > 15 mEq/1/24 h), the risk of myelinolysis could be greatly reduced by rapidly decreasing the serum sodium through hypotonic fluids administration and dDAVP.",

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms seen in all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis rests on the identification of the specific features of particular disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of co-existing depressive symptoms, and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a course of individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, so it helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

      "abstract": "This particular group of children recovering from tuberculous meningitis have suffered a significant degree of intellectual impairment. It appears that the factor having the most unfavorable influence in intellectual recovery is severe clinical illness as evidenced by convulsive seizures. Loss of consciousness for some time during the early phase of tuberculous meningitis in itself does not appear to be a highly unfavorable sign. Nevertheless, when unconsciousness is associated with convulsive seizures the intellectual functioning of the patient, in most instances, can be expected to be seriously impaired. An infant with tuberculous meningitis may be expected to have an unfavorable prognosis aside from any other factors. An older child, who has remained conscious throughout his illness and without convulsions, may be expected to have a relatively good prognosis. Adverse social factors, prolonged hospitalization and isolation, and sensory-motor sequelae are considered to have influenced unfavorably the psychometric scoring of many of these children. Repeat psychometric testing, after an interval, reveals that still further improvement in intellectual functioning may be expected in a number of these children who do not have serious sensory-motor impairment. For the majority, however, repeat testing reveals that they have varied little from their previous performance; the normal children continuing to develop within their normal group whereas the retarded children have remained retarded. It is noteworthy that observations on five adults treated at the Alexandra Hospital have been at some variance with the observations of Williams and Smith who found no measurable disturbance of intellect, personality or memory in 19 adult patients. Three of the five adults treated in this unit have obvious changes in personality in that they are unable to concentrate as formerly, are easily frustrated, childish and frequently quick-tempered. The remaining two patients appear to have no apparent intellectual or personality sequelae. Although this is a study of a small number of children, it is hoped that other workers will undertake psychometric evaluation of children recovering from tuberculous meningitis and make their results known for comparison.",

El paciente presento de forma progresiva y en orden cronologico sintomas gastrointestinales, luego neurologicos, que de no haber sido atendido en un centro hospitalario, podria haberle ocasionado su deceso. Debido a los danos que causan los metabolitos toxicos del metanol en el sistema nervioso central, la gravedad de intoxicacion es directamente proporcional a la acidosis metabolica, siendo el tiempo de ingesta y aparicion de sintomas, el pilar fundamental para conocer su pronostico. La tomografia computarizada (TC) de cerebro se ha introducido como un dispositivo de diagnostico complementario y eficaz en la evolucion del paciente, siendo la presencia de necrosis difusa de la sustancia blanca, la de peor pronostico.",

      "abstract": "Neuropati Optik Toksik (NOT) adalah kelainan pada fungsi penglihatan akibat kerusakan saraf optik yang disebabkan oleh zat beracun salah satunya adalah etambutol. Kejadian NOT terkait etambutol ini sangat bervariasi dari beberapa studi berkisar antara 0,5 - 35% penderita. Neuropati optik toksik dapat memberikan gejala berupa penurunan penglihatan yang berlangsung progresif, semakin memberat hingga dapat terjadi kebutaan. Meskipun hilangnya penglihatan ini bersifat reversibel saat etambutol diturunkan dosisnya atau dihentikan, beberapa pasien mengalami gangguan penglihatan permanen bahkan dengan dosis obat yang standar. Beberapa kasus progresifitas tetap berjalan meskipun obat telah dihentikan. Seringkali dijumpai perbaikan yang tidak sempurna. Bahkan ada pula yang mengalami kebutaan permanen. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah Melaporkan kasus Neuropati Optik Toksik akibat terapi Etambutol pada penderita TB. Seorang wanita usia 28 tahun, dengan keluhan pandangan kabur sejak satu minggu yang lalu dan dirasakan semakin memberat. Tidak didapatkan keluhan mata merah, nerocoh, maupun nyeri pada mata. Pasien juga mengeluhkan nyeri kepala terasa berat pada seluruh kepala disertai mual. Keluhan lain seperti kejang, penurunan kesadaran, kelemahan separo tubuh, kesemutan, merot, maupun pelo tidak didapatkan. Tidak ada riwayat diabetes maupun hipertensi. Pasien terdiagnosis TB paru satu bulan yang lalu, kemudian mulai menjalani pengobatan TB regimen HRZE dengan dosis standar sejak dua minggu ini. Pemeriksaan Fisik dan neurologis hanya didapatkan penurunan visus VOD 6/20, VOS 6/40, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex OS menurun, pemeriksaan lain dalam batas normal.  Pada pasien ini, keluhan pandangan kabur mulai dirasakan setelah satu minggu mengkonsumsi etambutol, durasi ini cukup cepat mengingat pada literatur disebutkan onset munculnya gejala mulai dua bulan hingga enam bulanan. Dosis etambutol yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien ini adalah dosis standar, yaitu 15 mg/kgBB. Pada pemeriksaan fisik& neurologis semua pemeriksaan normal kecuali status oftalmologis. Didapatkan VOD 6/20 VOS 6/20, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex menurun. Pemeriksaan laboratorium juga telah dilengkapi dan tidak didapatkan abnormalitas. Pada awalnya pasien juga mengeluh nyeri kepala disertai muntah. Sehingga neurologis juga memikirkan diferential diagnosis suatu proses intrakranial. Namun hal ini telah disingkirkan dengan hasil CT Scan kepala yang menunjukkan gambaran normal. Selama perawatan terapi yang diberikan adalah berupa anti inflamasi, neurotropik, obat simtomatis untuk keluhan nyeri kepala mual muntahnya, dan melanjutkan terapi TBnya tanpa etambutol. Evaluasi visus dilakukan setiap hari saat opname, dilanjutkan tiap minggu saat rawat jalan. Perbaikan mulai dirasakan oleh pasien setidaknya tiga hari setelah dilakukan penghentian regimen etambutol. Perubahan yang signifikan tampak setelah dua minggu penghentian. Kemudian tiga minggu setelah keluhan, di klinik rawat jalan pasien mengatakan bahwa penglihatannya sudah kembali normal, demikian pula hasil pemeriksaannya, VODS 6/6, scotoma central-, funduskopi dbn. Neuropati optic akibat etambutol dapat reversibel. Penghentian obat harus segera dilakukan bila didapatkan keluhan terkait penglihatan pada pasien, yaitu berupa penurunan visus, gangguan lapang pandang, maupun abnormalitas funduskopi. Dari evaluasi visus selama perawatan, pasien mengalami perbaikan visus sempurna dalam waktu tiga minggu setelah obat dihentikan.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment after critical illness (CIACI) is a frequent consequence of serious disease or injury that has been reported in as many as 66 % of patients, 3 months after an illness requiring intensive care unit hospitalisation. The condition has been recognised only within the past 15 years and its pathological mechanisms are, as yet, incompletely understood. The neurological changes and cellular and inflammatory processes of CIACI overlap with those of stroke, traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disorders. Patients also show brain atrophy, which worsens with the duration of intensive care unit stay. Risk factors associated with CIACI include depression, biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (e.g. apolipoprotein E), delirium, exposure to some drugs (e.g. fentanyl, morphine and propofol) and intubation. Current strategies to prevent or treat CIACI include treatments to reduce agitation and delirium and physical and mental rehabilitation including cognitive therapy. Many brain diseases and injuries affect the functioning of the neurovascular unit (NVU), which constitutes the key cellular building block of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). CIACI is believed to affect the integrity of the NVU and it is among the potential targets for therapy. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs), such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are known to play an important role in neurogenesis, maintenance of NVU structure and neuronal repair after disease and injury. This led to the development of strategies including the NTF-preparation (Cerebrolysin®), which is effective as a post-stroke therapy and has potential in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and brain injury as well as CIACI. There are currently no proven treatments for CIACI; improved understanding of the condition and further evaluation of NTFs may lead to effective treatments, which are vital to tackle this increasingly serious public health problem.",

One problem with conventional therapy is its reliance on systemic delivery of neuroactive molecules. By this route of administration, molecules encounter the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as an obstacle to their passage into the CNS. As a consequence, high systemic doses are often needed to achieve therapeutic concentrations, and, as often, these doses are associated with severe peripheral side effects. For instance, as Parkinson’s disease (PD) becomes refractory to systemic administration of levodopa, ever-increasing doses of this drug are required to achieve an effect. The longterm fluctuation phenomenon, as well as severe side effects, place limits on this mode of therapy.",

Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

Sleep disorders are one of the most common clinical problems encountered in outpatient settings and inpatient settings. Lack of sleep can lead to the inability to concentrate, memory complaints, and deficits in neuropsychological testing. Additionally, sleep disorders can have serious consequences, including fatal accidents related to sleepiness. Disturbed sleep can be a primary diagnosis itself or a component of another medical or psychiatric disorder. Narcolepsy is plausibly caused by an abnormality of REM-inhibiting mechanisms, and recent research involving hypocretin, a neurotransmitter, suggests that hypocretin is significantly reduced in narcolepsy patients. Patients with delayed and advanced sleep phase insomnia can be treated with proper timing of bright light and behavioral changes. Hypersomnia related to a mental disorder is usually found in a variety of conditions such as the early stages of mild depressive disorder, grief, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and somatoform disorders.",

      "title": "An improved understanding of neuropathic pain",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain represents a series of relatively uncommon chronic pain conditions, caused by lesions or dysfunctions of peripheral or central afferent pathways in the nervous system. The symptoms and signs of neuropathic pain can all be explained by a neuronal hyperexcitability at the site of the nerve lesion, which subsequently and in a dynamic fashion recruits more central sites. The manifestations of such neuronal hyperexcitability are therefore rather similar, irrespective of the causes or sites of the lesions. The key findings in neuropathic pain are: (a) pain in an area with sensory loss; (b) positive sensory symptoms such as dysesthaesia and allodynia in the injured area, where sensory discrimination is abolished; and (c) an abnormal sympathetic activity. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuronal hyperexcitability has increased dramatically within the last decade, and accordingly, it has been suggested that pain be classified according to a mechanism‐based approach. The challenge for an improved understanding of neuropathic pain—which is the key for better treatment—lies in elucidating the relationships between symptoms, signs, aetiology, anatomical lesions, and underlying mechanisms. At present, this is not a trivial task. © 2002 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Chronic encephalopathies may be non-progressive, occurring, for example, as a consequence of brain trauma or cerebral hypoxia, or progressive, arising as a result of an intrinsic, extrinsic or metabolic cerebral disorder. The primary focus of this article is the dementia syndromes that result from progressive degenerative disease. However, vascular disease will also briefly be addressed, because vascular dementia is relatively common and is an important cause of dementia. The traditional view of dementia as a global loss of intellect is inaccurate. Cerebral diseases do not affect the brain uniformly, but preferentially affect certain brain regions and spare others. Moreover, psychological processes themselves are regionally organized in specific brain regions. Different cerebral diseases therefore are associated with distinctive and characteristic neuropsychological syndromes, whose identification can",

      "abstract": "O Status Epilepticus (SE) e u ama ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e ou sintomas devido a atividade neuronal excessiva ou sincronia anormal no cerebro. O termo transitorio e usado como demarcador de tempo, para inicio e fim da crise. A crise neonatal constitui-se a mais frequente manifestacao de disfuncao neurologica no recem-nascido, com maior incidencia no primeiro ano de vida, e apresenta risco de morte, lesao neuronal, morte neuronal, alteracoes de redes neuronais ou prejuizos neurologicos e cognitivos de longo prazo dependendo do tipo de duracao da crise. Entretanto, cerca de 40%-50% das criancas afetadas se desenvolvem normalmente. Estudos em modelos animais demonstram que as convulsoes neonatais em roedores produzem efeitos adversos neurologicos de longo prazo, tais como: deficits na aprendizagem, memoria visuo-espacial, prejuizo na flexibilidade cognitiva, comportamento autista, caracterizado pela baixa preferencia pela novidade social, deficit de discriminacao social e comportamento tipo ansioso. Com base no conjunto de alteracoes desencadeadas pelas crises neonatais em roedores, o modelo pode ser util para a investigacao da relacao entre as convulsoes no inicio do desenvolvimento e as funcoes executivas. Assim, este projeto pretende avaliar comportamentos relacionados as funcoes executivas de animais que foram expostos ao SE neonatal. Ratos Wistar machos ao nono dia de vida (P9) foram submetidos ao SE pela administracao da policarpina (350 mg/kg, ip) e os controles receberam salina 0,9% (0,1 mL/10 g). Em P60 os animais foram avaliados pelos seguintes paradigmas: a caixa de condicionamento operante e o labirinto em T. A amostra foi composta por 25 animais, 11 controles e 14 experimentais. Estes testes avaliam: aprendizagem associativa visuo-espacial, consolidacao da memoria, memoria de trabalho, comportamento perseverante, controle inibitorio e flexibilidade comportamental. Os dados sugerem que o grupo experimental, na caixa de condicionamento operante, nao exibiu prejuizo na aprendizagem associativa visuo-espacial, que houve a consolidacao da memoria, nao apresentou comportamento perseverante, prejuizo na memoria de trabalho e nem comportamento perseverante. No labirinto em T o grupo experimental mantiveram preservadas a memoria de trabalho, a memoria de referencia e motivacao, e nao exibiram prejuizo na flexibilidade comportamental. Os dados sugerem que um unico episodio SE neonatal nao impacta a aprendizagem associativa, a memoria de longo prazo, as memorias de trabalho e de referencia e a flexibilidade comportamental.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is frequent in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In particular, specific deficits in temporal lobe related functions occur, but deficits in extratemporal lobe functions and global intelligence are also found. The degree and type of the impairment are first determined by structural damage and functionally dynamic factors. Most cognitive problems in TLE are already detectable at, or even before, the onset of the epilepsy. Accumulation of damage during the course of chronic epilepsy may add to this. This additional damage may be caused directly by severe seizures, head trauma, intoxication etc., or indirectly by interference of the epilepsy with mental development. Surgical treatment of TLE may also affect the cognitive outcome of patients with chronic TLE, with a risk of additional impairments on the one hand and functional recovery due to seizure control on the other hand. With regard to patient-associated factors, better baseline performance, younger age, cerebral plasticity, and good mental reserve capacities are associated with a better outcome. With regard to treatment-associated factors, prevention of additional brain dysfunction/damage and successful seizure control are important.",

      "title": "The Role of NMDA Receptors in Opiate Tolerance, Sensitization, and Physical Dependence A Review of the Research, A Cellular Model, and Implications for the Treatment of Pain and Addiction",
      "abstract": "When administered acutely, opiates such as morphine produce characteristic behavioral effects, including a decrease in pain responsiveness (analgesia) and an increase in pleasure (euphoria). Because of their profound ability to produce analgesia, opiates are the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe or chronic pain. Because of their ability to produce positive reinforcement and pleasure, these drugs are widely self-administered and, therefore, represent an important class of abused drugs. Long-term treatment with opiates, as well as other drugs of abuse, leads to three well-known consequences: tolerance, which is a decrease in an effect of a drug with chronic use; sensitization, which is an increase in an effect of drug with chronic use; and physical dependence, which is a physiological change produced by chronic use, such that the absence of the drug results in an unpleasant withdrawal syndrome* (1–3). Tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence are important in both the clinical use of opiates and in their self-administration. For example, the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of opiates may lead to the need to escalate the dose during the treatment of chronic pain, whereas tolerance to the euphorigenic effect may be a factor in the escalation of drug use in addicts (4). Conversely, tolerance to dose-limiting side effects may allow addicts to escalate drug intake and achieve greater euphorigenic effects. The development of sensitization is thought to be involved in the craving that occurs following chronic use of drugs of abuse and, therefore, critical to addiction (5,6). Finally, the avoidance of withdrawal in physically dependent individuals is considered to be an important factor in maintaining self-administration (2,4). Although tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence have been widely studied, there is still an incomplete understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in their development and expression. Recent experiments suggest that excitatory amino acid systems and, in particular, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may have an important role in these phenomena. This review will explore the role of NMDA receptors in the behavioral changes that occur following long-term opiate administration, including tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence. I will focus on opiates that act at the",

      "title": "Pharmacological inhibition of ictal and interictal epileptiform discharges",
      "abstract": "Background: Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures. Seizures are a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive and synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG), a non-invasive instrumental test, has an important role in the diagnosis of epilepsy, as well as in monitoring the results and long-term treatment because it can detect interictal and ictal discharges that are crucial for confirmation and classification of seizures. Antiepileptic drugs are the first treatment option in patients with epilepsy, although the effectiveness of such drugs is limited only to symptom control and requires a regular intaking by the patient. These drugs exploit the cell membrane channels, modifying their permeability, allowing either an increase in the inhibitory neurotransmission or the reduction in the excitatory one, by hyperpolarizing neurons and avoiding the recurrence of the epileptic seizures without reversing or stopping the underlying mechanism of epileptogenesis. Materials and Methods: The internship took place in the Neurophysiopathology department of the Antonio, Biagio and Cesare Arrigo’s hospital in Alessandria, from October 2022 to March 2023. During this period, it was possible to attend the emergency treatment of prolonged and recurrent epileptic seizures during EEGrafic recording and the consequential amendments of the ictal discharges induced by the administration of antiepileptic drugs. Follow up EEG was also performed to investigate the modifications of interictal activity after a period of treatment with antiepileptic drugs. The patient who has been analyzed in this paper, underwent EEG recordings obtained by using bridge electrodes placed on the scalp according to the international 10-20 system. Objectives: The aim of this study is to analyze the mechanisms of action of the main antiepileptic drugs, in relation to the physiological cellular mechanisms regulating the neuronal excitability and their effect on the ictal and interictal epileptiform discharges in the EEG recordings.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are brief events (typically &lt; 1 second, although some authors use a cutoff of up to 3 seconds) in the electroencephalogram (EEG), which are not accompanied by any overt change in behavior or consciousness. IEDs are associated with both chronic cognitive deficits and transient cognitive impairment (TCI). Higher IED load correlates with lower intelligence quotient (IQ) and poorer performance on tests of memory and executive function. TCI has mainly been observed during tasks that place high demands on attention, visuomotor speed, and working memory. There is evidence that IEDs may also directly interfere with episodic memory. Despite the evidence for associations between IEDs and cognitive dysfunction, there is currently scant evidence that IEDs, in fact, cause chronic cognitive deficit in humans. Although causality appears likely in the case of TCI, even here the conditions under which IEDs affect cognition are unclear. The evidence in favor of treating IEDs with medication is very limited. Attempts to treat IEDs should only be made when it is clear that cognitive impairment interferes with activities or participation. Such attempts require strong single-case designs and careful monitoring of both the EEG and cognitive function to establish the efficacy of treatment in individual patients.",

      "title": "Neural circuits underlying hyperactivity in an animal model for anorexia nervosa",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) means literally “a nervous loss of appetite” and is characterized by reduced food intake, extreme body weight loss, hypothermia, amenorrhea and emaciation. The average prevalence of AN has been reported to be 0.3% and has the highest mortality rate (>10%) of all psychiatric disorders. Excessive physical activity is demonstrated by many, if not most, patients with AN at some point in the course of the disorder, and has been described as a hallmark feature of the syndrome. The prevalence of hyperactivity varies widely between 31-80%, due to a lack of clear definition of hyperactive behavior in AN patients. Pharmacotherapy thus far played only a limited role in the treatment of AN and the fact that there are no effective drugs to treat AN argues against a straight forward involvement of common neurotransmitters in the etiology of AN. The neural mechanisms underlying AN remain obscure. Disturbances in dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission and to a limited extent in some peripheral hormones have been described in AN. Studies on the frequently used animal model for AN, the activity-based anorexia model, suggest a normal starvation response at the level of the hypothalamus in the brain. Regulation of food intake and body weight involves complex interactions between peripheral signals and neural circuits that influence metabolism and behavior. Dysfunction of this energy balance regulatory system may underlie eating disorders, such as AN. In the present thesis we focused on regulatory neuronal pathways underlying anorectic behavior and the possible involvement of endocrine signaling with special emphasis on the involvement of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. We thereby concentrated on starvation-induced hyperactivity, since this trait appears prominent in patients suffering from AN. The overall aim of this thesis was to identify the neural mechanism(s) underlying starvation-induced hyperactivity in order to better understand the pathophysiology seen in AN patients. First we determined which brain areas are involved in starvation-induced hyperactivity. Important hypothalamic brain areas known to be involved in the regulation of food intake were also identified to play a significant role in starvation-induced hyperactivity. Second, we determined the role of dopamine and its receptors by two different approaches; by blockade of dopamine receptors in the brain, and by measuring extracellular levels of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, a brain area known to be involved in food regulation and dopamine signaling. Next, we investigated the contribution of peripheral signals, leptin and ghrelin, in starvation-induced hyperactivity. We thereby identified that lack of leptin signaling in the ventral tegmental area of the brain accelerates starvation-induced hyperactivity. Moreover, blockade of ghrelin signaling reduces starvation-induced hyperactivity. Finally, we identified genetic loci and possible candidate genes underlying starvation-induced hyperactivity. Further research is needed to confirm whether the candidate genes are truly involved in AN. As a final point, this thesis provides novel data on the role of ghrelin, leptin and dopamine in particular on the hyperactivity observed in the ABA model. These data give new insights into the mechanisms underlying starvation-induced hyperactivity that may also underlie hyperactivity as observed in AN.",

      "title": "Management of Acute Onset Catatonia Postpartum in a Patient With a History of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

Thus, what matters when treating therapy-resistant depression is the strict, step-by-step deployment of existing therapeutic options at the right tempo and with a regular systematic evaluation of patient response. Remission should always be the aim, not just some abatement in symptoms (response). The following should be avoided: too small dosages of medication; changing the therapeutic strategy too frequently or too quickly; thoughtlessly sticking to an ineffective treatment over too long a period of time; or unsystematic poly-pharmacy. If these are all avoided than therapy-resistant depressive patients will have a good chance of recovery.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is an important neurological emergency. It is defined as seizures lasting for 5 minutes or more or recurrent seizures without recovery of consciousness to baseline between the attacks. Refractory SE (RSE) is defined as SE persisting despite sufficient dose of benzodiazepines and at least one antiepileptic drug (AED), irrespective of time. Super refractory SE (SRSE) is defined as SE that continues for 24 hours or more after the use of anesthetic therapy, including cases that recur on weaning of the anesthestic agent. RSE occurs in 23%–48% of the patients and SRSE in approximately 22% of the patients with SE. In general, RSE occurs in patients with new-onset seizures rather than in patients with chronic epilepsy. The etiology of RSE in developing countries is dominated by central nervous system (CNS) infections and head injury compared to stroke and drug withdrawal in the developed countries. The treatment of RSE and SRSE is not evidence based. Following benzodiazepines, the second line antiepileptic drugs include sodium valproate, phenytoin, levetiracetam, and anesthetic drugs such as midazolam, phenobarbital, and propofol. Most intravenous anesthetic drugs produce hypotension and respiratory suppression; therefore, patients with RSE are managed in intensive care units (ICUs). In RSE patients, electroencephalogram (EEG) burst suppression with interburst interval of 2–20 s or even flat EEG has been tried. Recently, concerns have been raised on the safety of burst suppression in RSE and SRSE. The paucity of ICUs in developing countries limits the use of these management protocols. There is a need to explore intravenous AEDs with safer cardiovascular and respiratory profile for the management of SE.",

It may be useful to compare MS with conditions such as Huntington's disease (HD), which have been referred to as subcortical dementia. A characteristic of these conditions may be an impairment in implicit (unconscious) memory, but not in explicit (conscious) memory. The present study examined the functioning of explicit and implicit memory in MS. Results showed that implicit memory was not significantly impaired in the MS subjects, and that they were impaired on recall but not recognition. A correlation was found between implicit memory performance and disability status in MS patients. Findings also suggest the possibility of long-term priming of implicit memory in the control subjects. The implications of these results are discussed.",

      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

      "title": "Faktoren der Vulnerabilität für Bewegungsstörungen (Spätdyskinesien) bei der Schizophrenie",
      "abstract": "Den erwiesenen Vorteilen einer neuroleptischen Therapie bei der Behandlung von Psychosen steht das klinische und möglicherweise ethisch-rechtliche Problem des Auftretens von Bewegungsstörungen (Spätdyskinesien) bei einem Teil der Patienten gegenüber. Im allgemeinen stellen zunehmendes Alter und eventuell die Zugehörigkeit zum weiblichen Geschlecht Risikofaktoren dar. Die Hauptschwierigkeit bleibt aber, darüber hinaus individuelle Faktoren zu bestimmen, die mit dem Auftreten oder Nichtauftreten des Syndroms in Zusammenhang stehen. In der Literatur der letzten Jahrzehnte (Jeste und Wyatt, 1981; Kane und Smith, 1982; Waddington, 1984, 1985a) fehlt ein konstanter Nachweis dafür, daß Patienten mit Bewegungsstörungen im Vergleich zu Patienten ohne Bewegungsstörungen besonders hohe neuroleptische Dosen erhalten hatten oder über einen besonders langen Zeitraum behandelt worden waren, obwohl Dosierung und Behandlungsdauer allgemeine Risikofaktoren darstellen können. Daraus könnte man schließen, daß eine Vulnerabilität für das Auftreten des Syndroms eher durch das zentrale Nervensystem des einzelnen Patienten bestimmt wird als durch die Art der neuroleptischen Behandlung. Ältere chronisch psychotische Patienten mit Spätdyskinesien dürften eine erhöhte Morbiditäts-und Mortalitätsquote haben (McClelland et al., 1986; Youssef und Waddington, 1987). Wie wir kürzlich berichteten, konnte bei einer Gruppe stationärer chronisch schizophrener Patienten mit und ohne Bewegungsstörungen kein Unterschied in bezug auf die neuroleptische Behandlungsdauer oder die neuroleptische Gesamtdosis festgestellt werden. Die Patienten mit Spätdyskinesien zeigten jedoch deutlich stärkere Störungen der kognitiven Funktionen und ein Übermaß an negativen Symptomen (Waddington et al., 1985a; Waddington und Youssef, 1985, 1986a). Im Verlauf weiterer Untersuchungen haben wir bei ambulanten schizophrenen Patienten, insbesondere bei älteren Patientinnen, bei denen die Psychose spät aufgetreten war (Waddington und Youssef, 1986b), einen ähnlichen Zusammenhang festgestellt. Im folgenden werden die Ergebnisse einer unserer Studien dargestellt, um das Wesen dieser Zusammenhänge zu veranschaulichen.",

      "abstract": "Poststroke fatigue is a common and disabling condition. However, few studies on or therapeutic trials addressing poststroke fatigue have appeared in the literature. We aimed to review the prevalence, natural course, potential predisposing factors (physiological, psychocognitive, and organic), and pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments of poststroke fatigue. Using PubMed CINAHL and PsycINFO, we reviewed all the available literature on poststroke fatigue and related issues. The prevalence of poststroke fatigue ranges from 23% to 75%, depending on the definition of fatigue and the characteristics of the patients included. Post-stroke fatigue seems to be of complex etiology. Predisposing factors were physiological ones including functional disability, prestroke fatigue, medical comorbidities, medication, sleep disturbances, and nutritional problems; psychocognitive ones including depression and cognitive dysfunction; and organic ones including damage to particular brain areas with consequent neurochemical alterations, perfusion deficit, and neuroinflammation. Poststroke fatigue is a persistent and debilitating symptom in some patients, and can have adverse affects on patient's neurological recovery, quality of life, and mortality. Few therapeutic trials have been reported, and the therapy was rarely successful, possibly because of the complex nature of poststroke fatigue. Poststroke fatigue is a common and frequently disabling problem of complex etiology. Further studies are urgently needed to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of post-stroke fatigue and to develop better treatments for this condition.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive disorders observed in non-demented Parkinsonian patients are frequent but subtle. They mostly result from difficulties to control attentional resources. These deficits particularly disturb the strategies involved in planning as well as in encoding and retrieval processing of memory, whereas consolidation of the mnemonic traces and instrumental functions are relatively spared. These deficits can be related to the striatal dopamine depletion (in particular in the caudate nuclei) which seems sufficient to account for the cognitive disorders that appear early in the course of the disease. In particular, the caudate dopamine depletion induces a cascade of dysfunction within the basal ganglia, downstream of the striatum, which ultimately affects the prefrontal functions. It is likely that, in the course of the disease, lesions of other ascending systems of neurotransmission (cholinergic, serotoninergic and noradrenergic pathways) contribute to worsen the cognitive disorders and also to modify their clinical pattern. The impact of direct cortical lesions can also be discussed but it seems that these lesions mostly contribute to the cognitive deficits in the late stages of Parkinson's disease.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a commonly encountered condition in clinical practice. The prevalence of self-reported poor sleep increases with age and is more common in women. There are clear associations between poor sleep and psychiatric disturbance; however, causality in this regard may be complex, and there are at least some insomniacs who show high somatic tension without marked psychopathology. The development of chronic insomnia can be conceptualized as involving predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. Pharmacological treatments for insomnia most typically involve judicious and intermittent usage of a benzodiazepine hypnotic. A variety of such medications are available, with varying absorption and elimination characteristics. Benzodiazepines are preferred over antidepressants in the treatment of insomnia inindividuals without major psychiatric disorder because of fewer side effects and a larger margin of safety. Nonpharmacological treatments typically rely on elements of sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and chronotherapy. The establishment of good patient-clinician rapport and the working through of unfounded beliefs and unrealistic expectations of the sleep experience are also important components of the behavioral treatment of insomnia. Use of such techniques, particularly when combined in a treatment package, has shown appreciable benefits in improving sleep.",

Similar unusual and unexpected effects of cerebral lesions are observed in patients with different types of the disease. Special attention is paid to stroke and traumatic brain injury. The paper presents the results of studies showing a decrease in the severity of extrapyramidal disorders, pain syndromes, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and various kinds of addictions in patients after a stroke. Cases of regression of epileptic seizures and behavioral disorders after traumatic brain injury are also considered. It is emphasized that such unusual effects are based on the reorganization of cerebral connections with the activation of inhibitory mechanisms that normally do not manifest themselves clinically, or with certain features of neuroplasticity processes occurring in pathological conditions.",

      "abstract": "A person's well-being and health are greatly affected by disorders of sleep and wakefulness. It is of the utmost importance to diagnose and treat such conditions, since the associated daytime sleepiness is a major risk factor for accidents. Early establishment of the correct diagnosis paves the way to achieving an excellent therapeutic outcome. Health-economic requirements of appropriateness and necessity mandate the specific use of cost- and time-intensive examinations in the sleep laboratory. In accordance with the guidelines for \"non-restorative sleep\", severe and chronic sleep disorders can be diagnosed outside the sleep lab if the underlying cause can already be identified on the basis of the patient's history. Such is usually the case in sleep disorders caused by external influences, disturbed circadian rhythm or pre-existing neurological, psychiatric or internal disorders. Standardized questionnaires are used to record and evaluate the patient's complaints, and vigilance testing to assess impaired sustained attention during the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness is quantified by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In the case of some disorders such as apnoea, or periodic leg movements, simplified ambulatory methods have been developed to enable their detection at an early stage. The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep disorders in the sleep lab is cardiorespiratory polysomnography. The relevant biosignals for the assessment of sleep, respiration, heart function, the cardiovascular system and movement are well established. Some of the sensors employed need further improvement. Numerous methods for signal analysis are still undergoing development, and currently available automatic evaluation systems are not yet reliable enough to obviate the need for manual interpretation.",

However, there is little evidence concerning short-term sensory deprivation and whether its effects differ depending on the individual concerned, and in particular their proneness to psychosis. This study explored whether perceptual disturbances could be elicited by a brief period of complete isolation from sound and vision in both highly hallucination prone and nonhallucination prone groups. Greater psychotomimetic experiences taking the form of perceptual disturbances, paranoia, and anhedonia were found across both groups when under sensory deprivation. In addition, hallucination-prone individuals experienced more perceptual disturbances when placed in short-term sensory deprivation than nonprone individuals. This result is discussed in terms of difficulties in source monitoring as a possible mechanism involved in proneness to hallucinations.",

      "title": "The Potential Role of Iatrogenic Comorbidity in the Interaction between Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy in Anxiety Disorders",
      "abstract": "The combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in the setting of anxiety disorders is often viewed as a potential source of augmentation of clinical effects, with little attention paid to the potential occurrence of negative events. In most of the studies, however, if benefits ensued, they were modest and likely to fade. Further, 4 high-quality and well-designed individual studies suggest that the addition of a benzodiazepine or an antidepressant to cognitive behavioral treatment of anxiety disorders could be detrimental compared to placebo at follow-up. The aim of this review was to outline a novel hypothesis, which needs to be adequately tested but may shed some new light on this interaction. Any type of psychotropic drug treatment, particularly after long-term use, may increase the risk of experiencing additional psychopathological problems that do not necessarily subside with discontinuation of the drug or of modifying responsiveness to subsequent treatments. The changes are persistent and not limited to a short phase, such as in the case of withdrawal reactions, and cannot be subsumed under the generic rubrics of adverse events or side effects. The term ‘iatrogenic comorbidity' refers to unfavorable modifications in the course, characteristics, and responsiveness of an illness that may be related to treatments that were administered previously. The likelihood of iatrogenic comorbidity needs to be considered in clinical practice: The concurrent use of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy may yield advantages in the short term, but its costs at some later point in time may largely outweigh such benefits.",

Instead, death is now better regarded as an irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness combined with irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe. Since the brainstem is required for both consciousness and spontaneous breathing, irreversible loss of brainstem function (e.g. after trauma, haemorrhage, or hypoxia/ischaemia) defines the state of ‘brainstem death’. Clinical criteria for the diagnosis of brainstem death have been published, but practice varies around the world. Brainstem death lies at the extreme end of this spectrum and is, by definition, permanent. Unlike those with brainstem death, patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness may survive for many years without physiological support. The care of such patients has huge social, societal, ethical, and economic implications.",

      "title": "The Neuromuscular Fatigue-Induced Loss of Muscle Force Control",
      "abstract": "Neuromuscular fatigue is characterised not only by a reduction in the capacity to generate maximal muscle force, but also in the ability to control submaximal muscle forces, i.e., to generate task-relevant and precise levels of force. This decreased ability to control force is quantified according to a greater magnitude and lower complexity (temporal structure) of force fluctuations, which are indicative of decreased force steadiness and adaptability, respectively. The “loss of force control” is affected by the type of muscle contraction used in the fatiguing exercise, potentially differing between typical laboratory tests of fatigue (e.g., isometric contractions) and the contractions typical of everyday and sporting movements (e.g., dynamic concentric and eccentric contractions), and can be attenuated through the use of ergogenic aids. The loss of force control appears to relate to a fatigue-induced increase in common synaptic input to muscle, though the extent to which various mechanisms (afferent feedback, neuromodulatory pathways, cortical/reticulospinal pathways) contribute to this remains to be determined. Importantly, this fatigue-induced loss of force control could have important implications for task performance, as force control is correlated with performance in a range of tasks that are associated with activities of daily living, occupational duties, and sporting performance.",

      "title": "The effect of alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity on sleep, brain and cognition",
      "abstract": "Abstract In alcohol use disorder, drinking cessation is frequently associated with an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Early in abstinence (within the first 2 months after drinking cessation), when patients do not exhibit physical signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome anymore (such as nausea, tremor or anxiety), studies report various brain, sleep and cognitive alterations, highly heterogeneous from one patient to another. While the acute neurotoxicity of alcohol withdrawal syndrome is well-known, its contribution to structural brain alterations, sleep disturbances and neuropsychological deficits observed early in abstinence has never been investigated and is addressed in this study. We included 54 alcohol use disorder patients early in abstinence (from 4 to 21 days of sobriety) and 50 healthy controls. When acute physical signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome were no longer present, patients performed a detailed neuropsychological assessment, a T1-weighted MRI and a polysomnography for a subgroup of patients. According to the severity of the clinical symptoms collected during the acute withdrawal period, patients were subsequently classified as mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome (mild-AWS) patients (Cushman score ≤ 4, no benzodiazepine prescription, N = 17) or moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome (moderate-AWS) patients (Cushman score &amp;gt; 4, benzodiazepine prescription, N = 37). Patients with severe withdrawal complications (delirium tremens or seizures) were not included. Mild-AWS patients presented similar grey matter volume and sleep quality as healthy controls, but lower processing speed and episodic memory performance. Compared to healthy controls, moderate-AWS patients presented non-rapid eye movement sleep alterations, widespread grey matter shrinkage and lower performance for all the cognitive domains assessed (processing speed, short-term memory, executive functions and episodic memory). Moderate-AWS patients presented a lower percentage of slow-wave sleep, grey matter atrophy in fronto-insular and thalamus/hypothalamus regions, and lower short-term memory and executive performance than mild-AWS patients. Mediation analyses revealed both direct and indirect (via fronto-insular and thalamus/hypothalamus atrophy) relationships between poor sleep quality and cognitive performance. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity, which reflects neurotoxic hyperglutamatergic activity, should be considered as a critical factor for the development of non-rapid eye movement sleep alterations, fronto-insular atrophy and executive impairments in recently detoxified alcohol use disorder patients. The glutamatergic activity is involved in sleep-wake circuits and may thus contribute to molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-related brain damage, resulting in cognitive deficits. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity and sleep quality deserve special attention for a better understanding and treatment of brain and cognitive alterations observed early in abstinence, and ultimately for more efficient relapse prevention strategies.",

      "title": "Delirium and Dementia in the Elderly: Sometimes Associated or Always Together?",
      "abstract": "Background: In the elderly, the association of delirium and dementia can cause diagnostic problems because they share the same symptom of confusion. Delirium is often misdiagnosed as dementia and treated inappropriately, ignoring that it could be successfully addressed, which can lead to increased health risks up to death. Summary: Confusion indicates that functional reserve fails to compensate for the action of stressors. The decline in reserve is linked to aging-related changes in blood flow, mitochondria, cerebrospinal fluid, and immune function, as well as the appearance of structural precursors of disease. It is greater in dementia that adds a large burden of pathology, especially degenerative and vascular. Key Messages: Based on their common background linking normal and pathological brain aging, it can be argued that delirium and dementia are always associated to some extent and can aggravate each other. The clinical approach to their association, which currently relies on the preliminary diagnosis of delirium according to ad hoc protocols, could be simplified by taking delirium for granted so that its causative stressors, usually the most common diseases of old age and/or drug abuse, could be addressed immediately. This approach would benefit all demented patients: not only those who are in such a serious condition that they need to be hospitalized due to the risk of death, but also those with clouded delirium.",

Rana identifikacija djece sa rizikom razvijanja neuromotornih poteskoca neophodna je za rani fizioterapijski pristup. Fizioterapijska intervencija, koja ima za cilj pozitivno modificirati prirodni tijek ovih poremecaja, osigurava pocetak svoje primjene vec u prvim tjednima i/ili mjesecima života. Genetske anomalije ili kongenitalne lezije mozga, ne moraju nužno biti odgovorni za pojavu neuromotornih poteskoca kod dojencadi. Stovise, okolina i iskustvo mogu modificirati razvoj mozga i poboljsati ishod u dojencadi koja su u riziku od nastanka neuromotornih poteskoca. Ova definicija svrstava u jednu grupu sirok spektar neuroloskih problema kao sto su: autizam, poremecaj pozornosti s hiperaktivnoscu (ADHD), epilepsija i cerebralna paraliza. Cerebralna paraliza je poremecaj pokreta i položaja uzrokovan neprogresivnim ostecenjem nezrelog mozga. Posljedice ostecenja utjecu na motoricku funkciju, misicno-kostani i kognitivni razvoj. Imajuci uvid u stanje problema, trebamo uzeti u obzir da cerebralna paraliza ne predstavlja samo medicinski problem, vec i socijalni i psiholoski problem. Habilitacija djece sa neuromotornim poteskocama veoma je bitna jer ona olaksava razvoj djeteta i pridonosi boljem rezultatu terapije i kvaliteti života. U habilitaciji djeteta sa cerebralnom paralizom neizostavna je suradnja strucnjaka razlicitih profesionalnih disciplina. Djeca sa cerebralnom paralizom i drugim neuromotornim poteskocama, edukacijom roditelja i dobivanjem uputa za provođenje terapijskih programa kod kuce dobivaju vježbe kako bi im pomogle u ostvarivanju fizioterapijskih ciljeva. Primjena kucnih programa može povoljno utjecati na daljnji razvoj djeteta s poteskocama. Veoma je bitno pridržavati se programa vježbanja jer je to neophodno za postizanje razine vježbi potrebne za postizanje ciljeva. Ukoliko se kucni programi pravilno primjenjuju, mogu poboljsati grube motoricke funkcije, pokrete ruku i sake, kao i brigu o sebi, komunikaciju i ponasanje djece sa cerebralnom paralizom.",

      "abstract": "Currently, cognitive impairment is a determining factor in the decline in adaptation in the elderly. Damage to the cerebral vessels is one of the most common causes of the development of cognitive deficits. Patients with severe cognitive impairments are not easily treatable, require outside help, and have significant limitations in daily activities. In most cases, this stage is preceded by a period of mild cognitive impairment. As a rule, mild cognitive impairments often remain undiagnosed, since they do not cause restrictions in daily activities for a long time and are detected only thanks to highly specific neuropsychological tests. But it is precisely the timely diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment without dementia, that make it possible to achieve longterm remission of the disease, to delay the onset of pronounced cognitive deficit. Among the correction methods, non-drug methods and pharmacological therapy are distinguished. Of no small importance is the impact on vascular risk factors such as arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking, alcohol abuse, etc. Nutrition planning, dosed exercise and cognitive training are the most common non-pharmacological strategies for correcting cognitive impairment. Pharmacological treatment includes anticholinesterase and neurometabolic drugs, as well as drugs aimed at correcting risk factors. A growing number of researchers agree that complex therapy, including lifestyle modification and the use of pharmacotherapy, is preferable. The article discusses the most commonly used methods of treating non-demented cognitive impairments, presents the results of large randomized clinical trials devoted to this problem, presents our own experience of both exclusively non-drug effects on patients and the use of complex treatment using a neurometabolic drug.",

      "abstract": "This review discusses articles on cognitive impairments developing after one or more convulsive seizures. Cognitive disorders seem to be frequent complications of epilepsy. According to recent clinical studies, the intensity of cognitive declines depends on a frequency and severity of seizures. However, presence of an epileptic focus does not always indicate an increase in cognitive impairments. An effect of a single convulsive seizure on cognitive functions at this stage is uncertain. According to some data, cognitive impairments after a single generalized seizures develop only in specific clinical syndromes, on the other hand, they are influenced by the emotional state of the subject. This problem remains relevant today. Further work is needed in this direction.В обзоре рассматриваются результаты исследований, посвященных когнитивным нарушениям (КН) после одного или нескольких судорожных приступов. Согласно полученным данным выраженность когнитивных изменений зависит от частоты и силы приступов. Но влияние однократного судорожного приступа на КФ точно не установлено: по данным одних исследователей, КН после однократного генерализованного судорожного приступа развиваются только при отдельных клинических синдромах, по другим - большое влияние оказывает эмоциональное состояние обследуемого. Подчеркивается, что наличие эпилептического очага не всегда говорит о нарастающем снижении когнитивных функций. Актуальность проблемы, по мнению авторов, определяет необходимость продолжения ее активных исследований.",

It is an umbrella term for different subtypes that should be differentiated using a meticulous review of the patient’s history, physical exam, and work-up. Posing difficulties in diagnosis, findings at times may be inconclusive. We report a case of a depressed patient on hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presents with an acute agitated episode following a visual hallucination that he has been experiencing intermittently for six months, along with a three- to four-year history of cognitive impairments. Our differential diagnosis includes vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, pseudodementia, dialysis dementia, and early-onset Alzheimer’s. In this case, the findings of a normal mini-mental status exam (MMSE) and mental status exam (MSE) do not correlate with a working diagnosis. Due to persistent dilemmas in diagnosing early neurocognitive impairment, continued monitoring and re-assessment are necessitated for efficient management of psychiatric patients with cognitive decline.",

As reviewers you will be guided by the assessment criteria for somatoform disorders, especially because objectified findings are lacking.

      "abstract": "The environmental risk factors for schizophrenia can be summarized as operating either early in life or later nearer the onset of frank psychosis. This chapter focuses on the role of drug abuse as one of the later factors, and on how it interacts with familial and developmental factors. All the molecular genetic study results discussed are preliminary; both the positive and the negative findings need replication in larger samples. It is likely that certain drugs change the expressions of genes related to neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine or glutamic acid and also for transcription factors, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and the synapse. Recent research suggests that dopamine sensitization may underlie both craving and the onset of drug-associated psychosis. A drug abuser with low liability to psychosis may use psychostimulant drugs regularly for longer periods without developing psychosis or, at worst may have just brief psychotic symptoms.",

Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is the most precisely defined neuromuscular complication in this context. It is characterized by a primary axonal degeneration of the motor and sensory nerve fibers with degeneration of the skeletal muscles as a result of their denervation. The precise etiology of CIP remains elusive. Electrophysiology must be used to confirm the diagnosis of CIP because clinical evaluation is clearly insufficient and testing can also exclude other entities such as a Guillain-Barré syndrome or a primary disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Nerve biopsy studies are not required for a diagnosis of CIP. Other disorders can explain neurophysiological abnormalities in critically ill patients after the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, such as persistent neuromuscular junction blockade, pure axonal neuropathy, and necrotizing myopathy. The incidence of myopathies in critically ill patients is not well characterized, although the incidence most likely is high in critically ill patients with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). The clinical picture of a primary myopathy is indistinguishable from other ICU-acquired causes of neuromuscular disease. Three main forms of myopathies in the ICU have been described: critical illness myopathy, thick filament myopathy, and necrotizing myopathy. Myopathies are difficult to detect because the neurophysiological studies are neither sensitive nor specific and a muscle biopsy is required.",

In this chapter, the terms “dual diagnosis,” “substance use disorder[s],” “[name of substance] use,” and/or “[name of substance] dependence” are used. The more modern term “co-occurring disorder” is virtually synonymous with “dual diagnosis,” both of which reference the coexistence of a clinically significant use of drugs and/or alcohol with a primary psychiatric illness (an example of this would be bipolar disorder with cocaine dependence). Of course, a patient can have a substance use disorder (SUD) without having a dual diagnosis – i.e., without a separate, primary psychiatric illness [1]. The assumption is made that, unless mentioned specifically, clinical situations discussed here involve patients who do have a primary psychiatric illness in addition to a SUD. Also, although the fairly recent, though now outdated, DSM-IV criteria differentiated between substance abuse and substance dependence, this volume (again, unless specifically mentioned) does not make that distinction.",

      "abstract": "The baroreflex normally serves to buffer blood pressure against excessive rise or fall. Baroreflex failure occurs when afferent baroreceptive nerves or their central connections become impaired. In baroreflex failure, there is loss of buffering ability, and wide excursions of pressure and heart rate occur. Such excursions may derive from endogenous factors such as stress or drowsiness, which result in quite high and quite low pressures, respectively. They may also derive from exogenous factors such as drugs or environmental influences.Impairment of the baroreflex may produce an unusually broad spectrum of clinical presentations; with acute baroreflex failure, a hypertensive crisis is the most common presentation. Over succeeding days to weeks, or in the absence of an acute event, volatile hypertension with periods of hypotension occurs and may continue for many years, usually with some attenuation of pressor surges and greater prominence of depressor valleys during long-term follow-up. With incomplete loss of baroreflex afferents, a mild syndrome of orthostatic tachycardia or orthostatic intolerance may appear. Finally, if the baroreflex failure occurs without concomitant destruction of the parasympathetic efferent vagal fibers, a resting state may lead to malignant vagotonia with severe bradycardia and hypotension and episodes of sinus arrest.Although baroreflex failure is not the most common cause of the above conditions, correct differentiation from other cardiovascular disorders is important, because therapy of baroreflex failure requires specific strategies, which may lead to successful control.",

Many of the influences triggering or inhibiting epileptic seizures produce alterations of vigilance or are produced by them. Nearly all chemical influences more or less cause diminution of vigilance. The enhancement of vigilance may inhibit seizures. Decreasing vigilance may act vice versa. As a means to enhance vigilance afferent stimuli are able to trigger seizures. This may be accomplished when singular or rhythmic stimulation of afferents gets the already excited neuronal system oscillating. This principle is also responsible for the strong correlation between triggering of seizures and the sleep/waking cycle with its different grades of neuronal synchronization. On the other hand, inhibition of seizures is possible by a continuously applied stimulation load, which may disturb the increasing excitatory oscillation. Also, conditioning may trigger or inhibit seizures. But the EEG biofeedback only is used to decrease abnormal neuronal activity.",

      "abstract": "“Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. Each individual learns the application of the word through experiences related to injury in early life”[1]. It is now clear that premature and full-term newborns have the neuroanatomical pathways from the periphery to cortex required for nociception. In fact by the 23th week of gestation painful stimuli are associated with physiologic, hormonal, and metabolic markers of the stress response. Indeed pain perception may be greater because of immaturity of descending inhibitory pathways [2]. Preterm infants are particularly vulnerable to brief and long term effects of pain and stress because system modulating sensory experience is immature[3,4]. Neonatal intensive care involves a high number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures which are associated with pain for preterm and sick newborn infants. In addition to immediate unpleasantness, painful experiences can imprint themselves indelibly on the nervous system amplifying and causing typically painless sensations to be experienced as pain. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention (NFI) are recommended for painprevention and pain management [5]. In order to achieve optimum efficacy, both pharmacological and NFI additionally require a reduction of external stimuli, such as loud noise and bright light [6]. NFI is recommended for procedural and mild pain [7]. NFI for procedural pain is a treatment that is initiated before and during the procedure in order to reduce the physiological consequences of nociceptive transmission provoked by the procedure. Therefore NFI could be considered a “pre-emptive analgesia”. NFI activate the “gate control mechanism”, some intervention lead to an endogenous endorphin dispersal which contributes to modulation of the pain pulse at the level of spinal cord [8,9], some other may elicit activation of neuropeptides systems that can achieve an analgesic effect through the potentiation of opioid activity [10], There is sufficient evidence to support the use of NFI, particularlybreast feeding, sweet-tasting solutions, kangaroo care, non nutritive suckling, swaddling and facilitate touching for the common needle-puncture procedures [11-13]. Other NFI such as music, olfactory and multisensory stimulation areto some degree beneficial to neonates who undergo painful procedures [14,15]. Despite our limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of actions of NFI, there seems to be few documented short-term harms from their use. NFI need a collaborative effort. Support from the administration and leadership, both formal and cultural, is crucial for the implementation of NFI[16].",

It comprises a wide range of etiologies, including Creutzfledt-Jakob disease and Alzheimer's disease. When faced with a recent and rapid onset of major cognitive impairment, it is essential to rule out delirium or any other cause that may lead to rapid cognitive decline (such as stroke, encephalitis, or epileptic seizure). The work-up is based on a detailed history (drugs, exposure, medical history), a thorough clinical examination, and a broad biological work-up including MRI, lumbar puncture and EEG. Management should rapidly involve a neurologist or a specialized center.Les démences rapidement progressives se distinguent des autres troubles neurocognitifs par leur rapidité d’installation, soit moins de deux ans entre les premiers symptômes et le diagnostic. Elles comprennent des étiologies très diverses, comme les maladies de Creutzfeldt-Jakob et d’Alzheimer. Face à un trouble cognitif rapidement progressif et récent, il est essentiel d’exclure un état confusionnel ou une autre cause pouvant mener à un déclin cognitif rapide (par exemple, AVC, encéphalite ou crise d’épilepsie). Le bilan repose sur une anamnèse étendue (médicaments, exposition, antécédents), un examen clinique complet et un panel d’examens paracliniques pouvant notamment comprendre une IRM, une ponction lombaire et un EEG.

Addictive drugs produce their behavioral effects by initiating a cascade of neurochemical events that ultimately makes the organism seek the drug. Thus, addictive drugs have the property of reinforcing or rewarding drugrelated behaviors and thereby increasing the probability of a response, which is core to our understanding of the behavioral attributes associated with addiction.",

Pharmacodynamic aggravation of epilepsy usually translates into both increased seizure frequency and increased interictal electroencephalographic changes. A doubling or greater in seizure frequency may be considered as evidence for seizure aggravation. Seizure aggravation can occur with virtually all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (Somerville, 2002; Gayatri and Livingston, 2006). As the underlying mechanisms for antiseizure effects of AEDs are not fully understood, the mechanisms involved in seizure aggravation cannot be explained with certainty.",

Other causes of status epilepticus include infection, which is not necessarily confined to the central nervous system, occlusive cerebral vascular disease, metabolic and hypertensive encephalopathies, primary and secondary brain tumors, head trauma, degenerative central nervous system diseases of obscure origin, and, rarely, systemic diseases including the collagen diseases. Diagnosis of the type of status epilepticus is usually made by history and by observation of at least one seizure.

A related drawback is that short-term errors may be hard to overcome in the long run if the immediate decision sets one off on a bad behavioral pathway which becomes progressively more and more difficult to escape from later [2]. Addictions to drugs or “Pleasure” would be commonplace examples of this basic physio/ psychological principle of learning and life [3]. As philosopher Honoré de Balzac noted, “Pleasure is like certain drugs, to continue to obtain the same result, one must double the dose, and death or brutalization is contained in the last one” [4].",

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

A technique of nitrous oxide administration beyond the state of intoxication and avoiding the Stage of deep hypoxemia has been described. 3. Physiological changes with this form of anæsthesia are slight and the method may be considered safe. 4. After the anæsthesia, a period of facilitation of mental processes is observed, which is followed by a period of relaxation and sedation. 5. During the phase of facilitation, the patient has a feeling of increased well-being and shows greater spontaneity, less resistance, and enhanced insight, often expressing previously repressed ideational content and affects. 6. The period of sedation lasts for several hours and is not associated with drowsiness or confusion. Sleep is usually improved the following night and other sedation is often unnecessary. 7. In states of acute manic excitement, repeated daily administration of nitrous oxide has controlled and terminated the attack in some cases. 8. Nitrous oxide hypoxia produces some of the features of the \"shock treatments\" as well as of narcoanalysis, but it is safe, convenient, and simple in administration and may be used in ambulatory patients without interruption of their ordinary activities. 9. The theories on the pharmacological action of nitrous oxide and the reason for its choice are discussed.",

Symptoms of Meniere’s disease include recurring episodes of hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo and a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear. Remissions occur for varying periods of time between attacks, but recurrences can progressively damage the hearing apparatus and eventually lead to permanent hearing loss. The cause of Meniere’s disease is unknown. When the condition occurs secondary to known causes such as infection, trauma, or an autoimmune disease, it is called Meniere’s syndrome or secondary EH. Patients with Meniere’s disease are typically advised to avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol because these substances aggravate symptoms in some cases. Conventional treatment may also include measures to reduce fluid levels in the body (ie, a low-sodium diet [≤1.5 g/day] and diuretics), drugs that suppress the vestibular system (eg, meclizine, prochlorperazine, or diazepam), and glucocorticoids. Various surgical procedures may be recommended when medical treatment is ineffective. A number of natural remedies have shown promise in the treatment of Meniere’s disease, but most of these treatments are based on clinical observations or uncontrolled trials.",

      "abstract": "Because the publication of several prospective studies on near-death experience (NDE) in survivors of cardiac arrest have shown strikingly similar results and conclusions, the phenomenon of the NDE can no longer be scientifically ignored. The NDE is an authentic experience that cannot be simply reduced to imagination, fear of death, hallucination, psychosis, the use of drugs, or oxygen deficiency. Patients appear to be permanently changed by an NDE during a cardiac arrest of only some minutes' duration. It is a scientific challenge to discuss new hypotheses that could explain the possibility of a clear and enhanced consciousness--with memories, self-identity, cognition, and emotions--during a period of apparent coma. The current materialistic view of the relationship between consciousness and the brain, as held by most physicians, philosophers, and psychologists, seems to be too restricted for a proper understanding of this phenomenon. There are good reasons to assume that our consciousness, with the continuous experience of self, does not always coincide with the functioning of our brain: enhanced or nonlocal consciousness, with unaltered self-identity, apparently can be experienced independently from the lifeless body. People are convinced that the self they experienced during their NDE is a reality and not an illusion.",

Residual cognitive effects were observed in some but not in all tests after prolonged heavy cannabis use. The effects were mostly mild.

      "title": "Neuropsychological Late Effects",
      "abstract": "This chapter reviews neuropsychological late effects associated with childhood cancer and its treatment. The study of late effects presupposes that patients are long-term survivors, if not permanently cured, of their disease. Late effects are temporally defined as occurring after the successful completion of medical therapy, usually 2 or more years from the time of diagnosis, and it is generally assumed that late effects are chronic, if not progressive, in their course. This definition serves to separate late effects from those effects of disease and treatment that are acute or subacute and time limited, such as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or temporary cognitive changes induced by cancer therapy. Research interest in neuropsychological outcomes, as well as neurological and other functional late effects, has shown an increase commensurate with improvements in effective therapy. For example, 30 years ago when few children were cured of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), questions related to the ultimate academic or vocational performance of long-term survivors were trivial compared to the need for improved therapy. In contrast, today more than 80% of children diagnosed with ALL can be cured, and issues related to their quality of life as long-term survivors have now received increased emphasis. There is at least comparable attention to neuropsychological status in primary brain tumors. We first provide a brief medical background on the two most frequent forms of childhood cancer, ALL and malignant brain tumors, followed by a review of the current neuropsychological literature. The literature review provides an in-depth analysis of the types of cognitive impairments observed and known or suspected risk factors for impairments. When neurobiological substrates are known, particularly from neuroimaging studies, they are discussed. Finally, we conclude the review with sections that discuss current recommendations for a core battery of neuropsychological assessment of survivors and recommendations for future research. Approximately 20,000 children and adolescents under the age of 20 years were diagnosed with cancer in 1999 (Steen &amp; Mirro, 2000). The most commonly diagnosed cancer in this age group is ALL, a malignant disorder of lymphoid cells found in the bone marrow that migrates to virtually every organ system, including the central nervous system (CNS), via the circulatory system. ALL accounts for one fourth of all childhood cancers and 75% of all cases of childhood leukemia (Margolin, Steuber, &amp; Poplack, 2002).",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a complex, multidimensional syndrome that is prevalent in patients with acquired brain damage and has a negative impact on the neurorehabilitation process. It presents from early stages after the injury, and may persist over time, regardless of whether sequelae have resolved. Fatigue is conditioned by upper neuronal circuits, and is defined as an abnormal perception of overexertion. Its prevalence ranges from 29% to 77% after stroke, from 18% to 75% after traumatic brain injury, and from 47% to 97% after brain tumours. Fatigue is associated with factors including female sex, advanced age, dysfunctional families, history of specific health conditions, functional status (eg, fatigue prior to injury), comorbidities, mood, secondary disability, and the use of certain drugs. Assessment of fatigue is fundamentally based on such scales as the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Advances have recently been made in imaging techniques for its diagnosis, such as in functional MRI. Regarding treatment, no specific pharmacological treatment currently exists; however, positive results have been reported for some conventional neurorehabilitation therapies, such as bright light therapy, neurofeedback, electrical stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. This review aims to assist neurorehabilitation professionals to recognise modifiable factors associated with fatigue and to describe the treatments available to reduce its negative effect on patients.",

      "abstract": "The integrity of time consciousness is the condition of possibility of the identity through time of an object of perception as well as of the person who perceives it. I will present our findings about abnormal time experience (ATE) in people with schizophrenia. These data may support the following hypothesis: if the continuity of temporal experience disintegrates (of which ATE are experiential manifestations), overarching meaningful units are no longer available, thereby creating temporal gaps, e.g., in one's stream of consciousness. In some cases, thoughts that are no longer experienced as embedded in one's stream of thoughts are experienced as, e.g., thought interferences, blockages, insertion or withdrawal. These symptoms cannot be explained as a mere disturbance of attention or comprehension at the level of semantic combinations. Rather, the disturbance could be searched for at a more basic level where the temporal coherence of conscious awareness is constituted. A failure of the constitutive temporal synthesis may create micro-gaps of conscious experience. In the most severe cases, thoughts or other mental phenomena that are no longer embedded in the continuity of basic self-experience may appear in consciousness as “erratic blocks” and experienced as being inserted, or, if further externalized, as auditory hallucinations (“voices”). This coheres with the hypothesis that a breakdown of temporality may be bound up with the breakdown of prereflexive self-awareness.

Diagnostic criteria include motor conduction block (CB) at sites not exposed to compression or entrapment. CBs may persist or reverse irrespective of clinical outcome. Acute onset with generalized weakness is uncommon. We report four patients who presented acutely areflexia, pure motor deficits without sensory disturbances, multifocal CBs persisting at the same motor nerves on serial electrophysiological studies. Three patients had preceding infections; two showed IgM reactivity against the ganglioside GM1. Intravenous immuneglobulin (IVIg) improved or stabilized symptoms. Patients 2,3,4 receive maintenance therapy with IVIg for years. Acute-onset MMN (AMMN) should be differentiated from other immune-mediated neuropathies such as acute inflammatory polyneuropathy either demyelinating (AIDP) or axonal (AMAN), acute motor conduction block neuropathy (AMCBN), acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). The correct diagnosis deserves implications for patient long-term treatment and prognosis. Moreover, the authors address the problem of defining the spectrum of MMN particularly in the acute setting.",

      "abstract": "Poststroke seizure is a potential complication of stroke, which is the most frequent acute symptomatic seizure in adults. Patients with stroke may present with an abnormal or aggressive behavior accompanied by altered mental status and symptoms, such as hemiparesis, dysarthria, and sensory deficits. Although stroke manifestations that mimic seizures are rare, diagnosing poststroke seizures can be challenging when accompanied with negative postictal symptoms. Differential diagnoses of poststroke seizures include movement disorders, syncope, and functional (nonepileptic) seizures, which may present with symptoms similar to seizures. Furthermore, it is important to determine whether poststroke seizures occur early or late. Seizures occurring within and after 7 d of stroke onset were classified as early and late seizures, respectively. Early seizures have the same clinical course as acute symptomatic seizures; they rarely recur or require long-term antiseizure medication. Conversely, late seizures are associated with a risk of recurrence similar to that of unprovoked seizures in a patient with a focal lesion, thereby requiring long-term administration of antiseizure medication. After diagnosis, concerns regarding treatment strategies, treatment duration, and administration of primary and secondary prophylaxis often arise. Antiseizure medication decisions for the initiation of short-term primary and long-term secondary seizure prophylaxis should be considered for patients with stroke. Antiseizure drugs such as lamotrigine, carbamazepine, lacosamide, levetiracetam, phenytoin, and valproate may be administered. Poststroke seizures should be diagnosed systematically through history with differential diagnosis; in addition, classifying them as early or late seizures can help to determine treatment strategies.",

Severe microcephaly refers to an OFC < -3SD. Microcephalia vera (MV) and microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern (MSG) are genetic forms of isolated congenital microcephaly (< -3 SD at birth), with no extracerebral malformation. Their incidence has been estimated between 1/25 000 and 1/50 000 births. In MV, the brain is abnormally small because of a reduced number of neurons, but is keeping (sub) normal gyral pattern and has no other gross pathological abnormality. Mental retardation is usually moderate and in most cases, patients have no systematized neurological defects or seizures. Brain weight typically is < 500 g (1/3 normal) and OFC is between 24 and 29 cm at birth (normal OFC being higher than 32 cm). MSG has been misdiagnosed as MV or lissencephalies in the past. This disorder is defined by congenital severe microcephaly, reduced number and shallow appearance of gyri, and normal to thin cortex. Five types of MSG have been delineated on the basis of MRI and neurodevelopmental findings, but MV and MSG are likely to represent a continuous phenotype. Mental retardation ranges from mild and moderate (type 1) to severe (types 2 to 5). Pyramidal signs may be observed. Some forms (types 2 to 5) are associated with early-onset seizures and a poor prognosis. MV and MSG are due to abnormal neuronal and glial proliferation. In both types, the cortex is of normal (2.5 mm to 4 mm) or reduced thickness and has normal cytoarchitectonic appearance, with 6 layers of neurons, which contrasts with microlissencephalies or lissencephalies with microcephalies, characterized by an abnormal cortical thickness and an anarchic cytoarchitectony. MV and MSG are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. To date, no locus has been associated with MSG. Eight loci have been associated with MV and among those, three genes have been identified, MCPH1, ASPM, SLC25A19.There is no specific treatment for MV and MSG.",

Both sensory and motor axons are overactive in neuromyotonia, the symptoms of which are relieved by administration of anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine.

      "title": "Functional neuroimaging: the adaptive mechanisms in migraine",
      "abstract": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by a primary brain dysfunction subtended by an episodic activation and sensitization of the trigemino-vascular pain pathway. Although migraine attacks are clinically welldefined, the underlying pathophysiology of the more complex migraine scenario is largely unknown. Functional brain changes, that occur because of repeated migraine attacks, may be explained through a maladaptive feedforward allostatic cascade model. The fundamental assumption is that “the brain is a central organ of stress” [1], able to detect stressful or potentially stressful situations and react in form of behavioural and/or physiologic responses. These brain responses, mediated by the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine mechanisms, could be either adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, allostasis is the ability to protect the body through adaptation [2]. Contrariwise, the allostatic load and overload, resulting from repeated stress and/or allostasis [3], refers to the wear and tear on the systems that normally support adaptation. Compelling evidence suggests that the brain of migraine patients is significantly different from healthy controls. Some of these differences are related to abnormal cortical activity during painful stimulations, suggesting an “adaptive” response observed in the course of moderate or high noxious trigeminal stimulations. Conversely, other differences relate to abnormality in responses that should be adaptive but become impaired or maladaptive, such as altered brainstem processing. More recently, a decreased functional connectivity was demonstrated within the fronto-parietal network (FPN) in patients with migraine without and with aura in the absence of clinically relevant executive deficits. FPN represents the neural substrate of executive functions and FPN functional abnormalities might be a part of a complex cascade that terminates in a migraine attack. Specifically, FPN functional connectivity changes could underlie a defective executive functioning in which high-demanding conditions cannot be correctly processed and solved by patients with migraine, escalating the brain adaptive response, likely resulting in a risk factor for headache attacks. In conclusion, we believe that in migraine an internal state of dysregulation creates an allostatic load with maladaptive consequences on brain, behaviour, physiological regulation and systemic physiology that progress in a feedforward cascade. Thus, we suggest that migraine should be considered a brain disease and not simply a recurrent acute pain syndrome.",

      "title": "[Motor variant of the unilateral neglect syndrome as a consequence of brain injury].",
      "abstract": "Motor neglect is characterized by underutilization of one side of the body when this failure cannot be attributed to primary sensory and motor defects. Impaired motor activity manifests itself in disturbance of using spontaneously contralesional limbs in the absence of severe hemiplegia (motor neglect) or in reduced readiness to initiate and carry out intact ipsilesional arm movements within or towards the contralesional hemispace (pre-motor neglect). These specific higher-order motor deficits may occur in isolation (pure motor neglect) or as part of a more pervasive neglect syndrome involving disturbances in visual, auditory, and tactile modalities or even in mental images. The lesions underlying the motor variant of hemi-neglect are ascribed to various topographic sites of the brain involving cortical and subcortical structures of the right or, rarely, the left hemisphere. Motor features of neglect are more frequent, more severe and long-lasting in right--as compared with left--brain-damaged patients. This deficit additionally makes improvement and neurorehabilitation of patients with focal brain damage difficult.",

      "abstract": "Since prolonged failure of the respiratory control sysem is not compatible with life, the mechanisms underlying respiratory control must be robust under a wide range of conditions. However, a robust neural system need not be a rigid circuit. Neuroplasticity enables appropriate adaptations to frequent or chronic disturbances that initiate active modifications in respiratory control such as weight gain or loss, altitude exposure or injury [1]. Studies of respiratory plasticity are intended to reveal how and why experience or changing conditions influence the control of breathing. Further, the respiratory system provides an ideal model to explore fundamental mechanisms of neuroplasticity for at least two reasons. First, the respiratory neural control networks produce a spontaneous rhythmic and quantifiable motor output under a wide range of in vivo and in vitro conditions. Second, clear functional significance can be ascribed to respiratory motor output: it represents breathing. Many influential models of neuroplasticity (e.g., hippocampal long-term potentiation; [2,3]) lack these advantages.",

It is characterized by impairment of mental functions leading to memory loss, behavioural changes, and impairment in the activities of daily living. It may be caused by several different diseases, the most common being Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and Lewy body dementia. There are other potentially treatable causes, including depression, which must be excluded. Drug treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors may reduce the progression of dementia for a period, especially in Alzheimer’s disease. Antipsychotic drugs should be used with great care. The associated impairment and behavioural problems often requires social care, sometimes in institutions, and will place an increasing burden on medical services and society.",

This neurological clinical formulation is then assimilated with other tests and assessments from a range of medical specialities, and by so doing helps confirm the clinical impression.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most frequent sleep disorder. It is a symptom, and is defined as “chronic inability to obtain the amount of sleep needed for optimal functioning and well-being”. Untreated insomnia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Thorough assessment of insomnia is essential in choosing the most appropriate strategy for management. If a cause of insomnia is identified, initial treatment should be directed at specific factor. Since insomnia is a chronic condition, long-term and safe treatments are warranted. Non-pharmacologic options have been available for decades, but lack of physician awareness and training, difficulty in obtaining reimbursements and questions about efficacy have limited their use. These therapies offer the greatest potential for long term gains in preventing recurrence of insomnia. Pharmacological options are most useful for acute insomnia. They are commonly used but long term use of hypnotics can become complicated by drug tolerance, dependence or rebound insomnia. Non-pharmacological interventions produce reliable and durable clinical benefits in the treatment of primary insomnia, insomnia associated with medical or psychiatric conditions and insomnia in elders. Additional research is still needed to develop and validate treatment algorithms that would optimize outcomes and reduce morbidity. Author concludes that non-pharmacological therapies should always be a component in management of Insomnia. Method: Pubmed.gov was searched by using pre-determined key word.

Originally, as ‘adjustment reaction’, it was one of a very few disorder categories included in major psychiatric classification schemes specifically for use in children and adolescents. In DSM-I, for instance, adjustment reaction and childhood schizophrenia were the only two categories of childhood psychiatric disorder. The intention was to indicate that some instances of disordered behaviour or emotions arose specifically because of an identified stressor rather than, say, a process of mental illness. The source of stress was originally thought of as including both external events (such as bereavement) or an internal developmental process, which might require significant adaptation of mental functioning (such as maturational changes during adolescence). There was an implicit idea that adjustment to adversity or intra-psychic conflict could be either adaptive or maladaptive. If it was maladaptive, then personal dysfunction was to be seen as a psychiatric condition.",

It can be diagnosed with the same criteria that are used for adults. (2) Patients whose disease is of acute onset, with productive schizophrenic manifestations such as hallucinations and delusions (positive manifestations), have a better prognosis than those whose disease begins insidiously and takes an unfavorable course, with depressive states and continually worsening impairment of cognitive function. (3) The patient’s premorbid personality plays a major role. Patients who were described as socially active, intelligent, and integrated children and adolescents before they became ill have a better prognosis than those who were intellectually impaired, timid, introverted and uncommunicative before they became ill. (4) The prognosis seems to be better for patients who have no family history of schizophrenia, those whose families cooperate well, and those whose condition improves rapidly during inpatient treatment. (5) The few available studies on the course and outcome of schizophrenia beginning in childhood and early adolescence confirm that they are much worse than in adult-onset schizophrenia.

Extensive research has shown that the areas that control our sleeping behaviour are the hypothalamus, brain stem, midbrain, and amygdala. These areas coordinate events during the non-REM and REM phases of sleep-wake cycles. GABA and adenosine, two chemical neurotransmitters, are also involved and play an important role in our sleep cycle. Insomnia has caused a slew of psychological and physiological issues such as fatigue, decreased mental concentration, irritable nature and a higher risk of heart attacks and stroke. It has reduced the patient's quality of life of the patient and have a social impact on them. Primary insomnia is defined as the inability/absence of proper sleep and impaired daily life functioning. Secondary insomnia, on the other hand, is believed to result from pre-existing medical conditions, substance abuse, or as a side effect of certain drug therapy.

      "abstract": "Une crise d’epilepsie resulte de la survenue soudaine d’une activite neuronale anormalement intense, rythmique et synchrone dans une region plus ou moins etendue du systeme nerveux central. Les consequences cliniques sont extremement variees, selon les zones cerebrales affectees et la duree des crises, allant de breves secousses musculaires tres focalisees a une perte de conscience complete, eventuellement associee a des convulsions. Dans le cas de l’epilepsie-absence, une epilepsie generalisee d’origine genetique survenant frequemment chez les enfants, les crises s’expriment essentiellement par une suspension des processus conscients dans toutes leurs dimensions, y compris une interruption des perceptions conscientes. Ces symptomes sont correles a des decharges de pointes-ondes (DPO) dans les electroencephalogrammes (EEG) bilateraux. Les mecanismes physiopathologiques des alterations de conscience au cours des crises d’epilepsie-absence restent l’objet de debats intenses, opposant des alterations fonctionnelles a grande echelle a un filtrage des informations exogenes par les oscillations epileptiques. Au cours de mes recherches, j’ai explore l’hypothese alternative, mais non exclusive, d’un dysfonctionnement dynamique dans les processus d’integration sensorielle au sein des circuits thalamo-corticaux primaires. Des explorations electrophysiologiques fines n’etant pas realisables chez les enfants epileptiques, j’ai utilise un modele genetique presentant une forte homologie avec la pathologie humaine : le Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). En combinant in vivo des enregistrements electrocorticographiques (ECoG) et intracellulaires dans le cortex somatosensoriel primaire (S1), precedemment identifie comme le site de declenchement des crises, j’ai d’abord analyse les proprietes integratives et d’excitabilite des neurones pyramidaux du cortex S1, durant et en dehors des crises, et je les ai comparees a celles des neurones homologues chez des rats non epileptiques. J’ai montre que ces neurones presentent lors des periodes inter-ictales une excitabilite accrue, s‘exprimant par une augmentation de la decharge des neurones en reponse a des stimulations excitatrices d’intensite croissante ainsi qu’une tendance exacerbee a se re-polariser suite a une hyperpolarisation de grande amplitude, suggerant un accroissement du courant cationique h. Au cours des crises, les memes neurones montraient des changements differentiels dans leur excitabilite membranaire selon la composante pointe ou onde dans l‘ECoG correspondant. La pointe etait associee a une augmentation de decharge evoquee par un courant depolarisant et a une diminution de resistance membranaire. Symetriquement, l’onde etait correlee avec une augmentation de resistance membranaire et une diminution d’excitabilite. Ces changements dynamiques des proprietes integratives neuronales suggerent une instabilite des reponses corticales lors du cycle pointe-onde pouvant « brouiller » les signaux sensoriels lors des crises. J’ai teste cette hypothese en analysant les reponses des neurones corticaux, et des neurones thalamo-corticaux correspondants, a des stimulations appliquees sur les vibrisses controlaterales. Bien que les reponses synaptiques induites dans les neurones du cortex S1 par les stimulations sensorielles n’etaient pas globalement alterees lors des crises, elles etaient plus amples et plus efficaces pour declencher des potentiels d’action pendant l’onde compare a la composante pointe. Cet accroissement relatif de la reponse neuronale lors de l’onde ECoG resulte probablement de l’accroissement de resistance membranaire precedemment decrit, d’une augmentation de la force electromotrice des courants synaptiques glutamatergiques et de la forte probabilite de decharge des neurones thalamiques correspondants lors de cette composante.",

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

Street drug use by opioid-dependent and addicted cancer patients poses major difficulties in palliative care settings. A change from usual behaviour should alert the carers to the possibility of a psychological cause. Personality fragility compounds the intellectual limitations. Many intellectually disabled individuals are able to learn new information and from experience.",

      "abstract": "Clinically occurring memory disorders are difficult to classify on the basis of the hypothetical stages of memory. Since memory functions are widely distributed in the brain, memory disturbance forms part of the clinical picture in many pathological states. These include acute conditions associated with alterations in consciousness and chronic conditions secondary to vascular, infective, neoplastic, traumatic, metabolic, and other causes. Such memory disturbances are usually non-specific, involving several stages of memory, and are overshadowed by other clinical features. Much less commonly, relatively selective memory loss occurs and memory disturbance forms the major clinical symptom. These clinical disorders provide a window through which to study the organization of memory in man.",

The path from medical illness to depression reflects general mechanisms related to stress, disability, and loss, as well as more specific physiological mechanisms, including those related to subclinical cerebrovascular disease, adverse drug effects, and endocrine/metabolic effects. Similarly the path from depression to medical illness includes general mechanisms related to self-neglect, decreased adherence to medical treatments, maladaptive health-related behaviors, and, possibly, more specific physiological mechanisms including those related to altered endocrine and autonomic functions, in the clinical context, these two paths can interact to constitute a vicious cycle. With further research, it should be possible to translate current understanding in these areas into advances in both basic knowledge and treatments that could initiate virtuous cycles with beneficial effects for both menial and physical health.",

These can be distinguished from adverse reactions to cannabis, the commonest of which is an acute anxiety state. Acute psychotic episodes can also follow ingestion of the drug but are infrequent. These can be classified as acute confusional states and episodes occurring in clear consciousness. Neither presentation consistently shows enough specific features to warrant the diagnosis of 'cannabis psychosis' as a distinct clinical entity. The evidence that cannabis has a causative role in chronic psychotic or affective disorders is not convincing, although the drug may modify the course of an already established illness.

Epilepsy might be either the cause of the delay of acquisitions (epileptogenic encephalopathy) or only one additional manifestation, the consequence of the underlying neurological pathology (encephalopathy with epilepsy); it is therefore not the only factor responsible for delay. Within the framework of encephalopathies with epilepsy a rigorous diagnosis is necessary with, in particular a cutaneous examination (neuro‐cutaneous syndromes), a precise clinical examination (anoxo‐ischaemic sequelae of the perinatal period), an EEG, a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as the search for associated abnomalities (cardiac, renal…). There are also epileptogenic encephalopathies such as age‐related syndromes: Hemiconvulsions‐Hemiplegia‐Epilepsy syndrome; Rasmussen's syndrome; Dravet's syndrome; myoclono‐astatic epilepsy (Doose). Age at onset and type of seizures, as well as ictal and interictal EEG finding provide valuable hints for a specific diagnosis, while other investigation are usually not contributive. Developmental delay and epilepsy are frequently associated. One of the first steps to diagnosis consists in trying to establish the eventual causal role of the epilepsy. Answering this question may prove to be of primary importance for the choice of a therapeutic strategy and/or further etiological investigations.",

Further investigation revealed that the symptoms were caused by metachromatic leucodystrophy, Graves' disease, Huntington's disease, and a psychological background, respectively. The first patient became dependent in 1.5 years, the second recovered after treatment, the third was independent with slowly progressive symptoms after 1 year, and the fourth was advised to consult a psychologist. Disorders of attention and memory in relatively young people deserve a detailed evaluation at the very first visit, involving the elaboration of an initially extensive differential diagnosis. Too early a separation between a psychic and an organic pathogenesis should be avoided. Indications for the presence of a neurological condition include: consultation at the initiative of others, a relatively brief duration of symptoms without a clear provoking factor, the absence of a psychiatric history or life event, cognitive dysfunction in several areas, abnormal behaviour and an incriminating family history.",

The purpose of the current article is to examine the mechanisms, associated symptoms, and treatments for neuroinflammation and brain fog.

From a biological viewpoint, chronic fear and activation of glucocorticoids are metabolically costly. The physiological effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may elicit posttraumatic stress disorder, the physiological characteristics of which may be in the opposite direction to those of TBI. Somatic injury occurring in the concussive accident may be the most important consideration affecting status and outcome. Chronic stress impairs the process of wound healing, attributable to proinflammatory. Stress reduces the immune response, and reduces the proliferation and activity of various types of cells. Prolonged somatic activity related to injury, stress, pain; stress reactions to chronic pain and impairment; and unhappiness all result in neuroendocrine imbalances. Physiological dysfunctions contribute to neurobehavioral dysfunctioning that can be misattributed to cerebral injury, faking or secondary gain, if the practitioner does not consider the effects of an injury.",

Neuropathies are being recognized from new medications approved for use and other medications, which have expanded indications. Some established associations with neuropathy are less widely known while others are overestimated. Peripheral neuropathy from chronic drug exposure is more problematic to determine. Axonal pathology is most common, but some agents cause demyelination and even conduction block, mimicking immune-mediated neuropathies. Multiple and varied toxic mechanisms are implicated.

Epidemiological papers on sleep disorders show that a large number of people complain of sleep disorders. Today, there are several classifications and definitions for sleep disorders, and first of all for insomnia. Insufficient sleep can contribute to the occurrence of rapid fatigue during the daytime, reduced activity, attention and efficiency. Studies have shown that long-term and severe sleep disorders can lead to and/or exacerbate various somatic, neurological and mental diseases. Insomnia can contribute to cognitive impairment. Although both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions are available, drugs are more often prescribed due to greater availability. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first line treatment for adults of any age. Pharmacological intervention may be offered, if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is not enough effective or not available. At the same time, the pharmacotherapy for sleep disorders remains problematic despite a large number of sleeping pills. Sleeping agents that are widely used in medical practice both in terms of their mechanisms of action and final results such as their effect on sleep do not always contribute to the development of natural (or at least close to physiological) sleep. Benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, melatonin, and phytotherapeutic medicines can be used to treat insomnia.",

The withdrawal syndrome is analogous to alcohol withdrawal, except the duration of the syndrome occurs over a longer period of time with the symptoms being less intense than generally encountered with alcohol. The potential for withdrawal reactions is probably greater for the shorter-acting agents than the longer-acting drugs. Potentially dependent sedative/hypnotic users require stabilization of their symptoms initially, followed by tolerance testing. If tolerant, the patients should be withdrawn using either a long-acting sedative/hypnotic (e.g., diazepam) or phenobarbital. Compared to other benzodiazepines and barbiturates, diazepam appears to be the drug of choice for treating dependent patients. Diazepam is rapidly absorbed and distributed to the brain and therefore useful for stabilization and tolerance testing. It is metabolized on chronic administration to a long-acting metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, which makes the drug ideal for a tapered withdrawal schedule.",

Only the electroencephalogram (EEG) may show disturbance, but not always. Typical losses of consciousness are reflected the EEG if it is a case of petit mal. But these EEG tracings, whether recorded during or between seizures, give no clues whatever to etiology. The child or adolescent is then treated symptomatically. He will be re-examined later. The subsequent course varies. Sometimes seizures or blackouts cease under the effects of treatment. In other cases, new seizures occur at more or less long intervals, so that treatment must be modified or intensified. The patient will never, throughout his life, provide concrete evidence of any organic damage. This person is then classified as epileptic; and view of the absence of any discernible lesion as cause, the term is qualified by essential or idiopathic.

The assessment is often confounded by the treatment paradigms of modern intensive care (ie, drugs, drug interactions and targeted temperature management). Patients may be too unstable to leave the intensive care unit for neuroimaging; thus, repeated clinical examinations are decisive. Despite diverse causes, certain principles do apply: (1) Many patients can improve, although with significant abnormalities; (2) Neuroimaging and electrodiagnostic tests can help but are rarely definitive; (3) Secondary involvement of the upper brainstem marks a tipping point with much lower probability for an independent outcome; (4) We rarely predict mortality or diagnose brain death; usually the major concern is anticipated neurological deficits; and (5) Prior comorbidity and permanent organ dysfunction are critical factors in making decisions about de-escalation or escalation of care. This review provides a practical approach to evaluating outcome of a comatose patient. Prognostication is difficult, and we should only attempt it when the diagnosis is confirmed and appropriate (often aggressive) medical or surgical treatment has been tried.",

The depressed takes longer to initiate sleep, shortens the period to dreaming sleep, spends little or no time in deep sleep and is subject to hyperactive brain regions during sleep. Antidepressants rectify the disturbance and restore normal architecture and presumably normal brain metabolism during sleep. Early intervention may lead to a decrease in neuronal cell loss due to depression, and better long-term outcomes for mood disorders.",

      "abstract": "Toxic-metabolic neurologic conditions result from dysfunction of the central and peripheral nervous systems secondary to systemic processes, derangements of other organ systems, or pathologic accumulation (or absence) of certain substances. This domain of neurology encompasses conditions which may be acquired or genetic, reversible or irreversible, acute or chronic, pediatric-onset or adult-onset. They do not fit neatly into any specific domain of the established neurology subspecialties and thus require all neurologists to have a working familiarity with them. Often, toxic-metabolic effects on the nervous system manifest when patients are admitted to non-neurological inpatient services. Patients with chronic symptoms are also commonly referred to outpatient general neurology clinics. While the term \"toxic-metabolic encephalopathy\" is a common diagnosis for the consulting neurologist, it is important for readers to recognize the laboratory findings and imaging patterns that correlate with specific diagnoses to optimize treatment recommendations for patients and non-neurologists. The following 8 Teaching NeuroImages span a variety of toxic-metabolic conditions that a neurologist may encounter.",

The treatment therefore most likely to be successful in modifying the violent behaviour is that most appropriate for the underlying condition, and much may be achieved in calming aggressive behaviour without using any medication at all. No drug is a specific ‘treatment’ for violence. In situations of acute crisis, however, short‐term control of violent behaviour is often achieved most speedily and effectively when medication is included in the treatment approach. The drugs best fitted for such purposes have calming qualities. Neuroleptics are generally among the first to be used, followed by barbiturates or benzodiazepines. The power of the way in which such drugs are administered; for example, in the timing, route of delivery or form of preparation is often underestimated. In particular, the potential value of depot neuroleptics of intermediate duration of action is discussed. Longer‐term control of violence term of such drugs as the mood stabiliser lithium, anticonvulsants (including carbarnazepine), other sedatives and beta blockers is also discussed.",

The primary care physician should maintain an awareness of this mood disorder, be able to screen efficiently for signs and symptoms, and be able to differentiate major depression from dysthymia. The foundation of treatment is pharmacotherapy, in particular with serotonergic antidepressants, although response is moderate at best. Antidepressants are initiated at low doses and drug trials are conducted for 3-month periods if not precluded by side effects. When reasonably effective, antidepressants should be continued for 2 to 3 years or more. Adjunctive interventions in the treatment of dysthymia are based on comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions. Although dysthymia is an insidious, difficult-to-treat disorder, intervention is worthwhile. Further research may elucidate more effective interventions for this challenging disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neurometabolic diseases are a group of disorders that lead to a disruption in the normal metabolism within the body and nervous system. Abnormalities of metabolic processes at any level can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical features and pathologies. The nervous system is particularly susceptible to metabolic derangements, either inborn or acquired. Early diagnosis can prevent or delay damage to the nervous system through appropriate treatment when possible. Many neurometabolic disorders have poor prognoses, and patients often present and succumb within months to the early years of life; however, some disorders can present later in life with varying levels of severity. In many later onset cases, the diagnosis is preceded by nonspecific symptoms including psychiatric manifestations. In addition to psychiatric manifestations, various neurological features often occur at some point in the course of the disease. Of these features, movement disorders are particularly common. In fact, many neurometabolic diseases will present with subtle movement disorders that are often missed or overlooked. Many congenital metabolic diseases are rapidly neurodegenerative and, due to the nature of such diseases, result in early demise or severe cognitive decline. While by no means exhaustive, this chapter aims to outline and discuss some of the neurometabolic diseases that present with both psychiatric and movement disorders as prominent features.",

Ursächlich für chronische Schlaflosigkeit können körperliche Erkrankungen, psychische Erkrankungen, die Einnahme von Medikamenten, Genussmittel oder Drogen sein. Ein Drittel aller chronischen Insomnien wird als primäre Insomnie oder insomnische Störung bezeichnet, wenn keiner der oben genannten Faktoren ursächlich identifiziert werden kann. Üblicherweise werden chronische Insomnien in der ärztlichen Praxis medikamentös mit Hypnotika oder anderen sedierenden Substanzen, wie etwa sedierenden Antidepressiva behandelt. In den letzten 20 Jahren hat sich gezeigt, dass kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutische Ansätze (KVT) bei chronischen Insomnien auch unabhängig von der Ursache erfolgreich eingesetzt werden können. Zu den Methoden der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie gehört die Aufklärung über Schlaf und Schlafhygiene (Psychoedukation), Entspannungstechniken wie etwa die progressive Muskelentspannung, spezifische verhaltenstherapeutische Techniken wie etwa die Stimuluskontrolle oder die Schlafrestriktion sowie kognitive Techniken zur Reduktion nächtlicher Grübeleien. Aufgrund von mehreren, in den letzten Jahren veröffentlichten Meta-Analysen können diese Techniken insbesondere in ihrer Applikation als Kombinationstherapie, als evidenz-basiert und der pharmakologischen Therapie als kurzzeitig gleichwertig und langfristig überlegen angesehen werden.

The alteration of consciousness during epileptic seizures is discussed with respect to these findings: Alterations of consciousness during epileptic seizures may be produced by subcortical, i.e., reticular formation, and/or cortical dysfunction followed by excessive, hypersynchronous neuronal discharges. An impairment of consciousness during absence seizures may be due mainly to cortical dysfunction; during complex partial seizures (CPS), it may be due to dysfunctional subcortical neuronal structures. The mechanisms underlying an alteration of consciousness are defined as causing “irritative” functional disturbances and/or as having “inhibitory” effects on consciousness‐related structures.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic drugs reduce the severity and prevent the recurrence of symptoms of schizophrenia. Recent studies indicate that these drugs probably produce their antipsychotic effects by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain, although they also block acetylcholine and norepinephrine receptors. The potency of commercially available neuroleptics in blocking dopamine receptors varies widely, being related to the compound's lipid solubility. Neuroleptics predispose the patient to short-term and long-term medical hazards that must be weighed against the benefits of reduced symptom intensity, shortened psychotic episodes and lessened likelihood of recurrence of acute schizophrenic epidoses. The side effects associated with short-term therapy are either extremely rare or are treatable by dose change, medication change or the use of additional drugs. In long-term therapy the risks are more problematic in that they are sometimes irreversible. These include tardive dyskinesia, skin discoloration and corneal deposits. The clinician must consider the pattern aand severity of each patient's present and past psychotic episodes before deciding whether maintenance therapy with neuroleptics is justified. If it is, doses should be re-evaluated frequently and kept as low as possible. Concomitant administration of anticholinergic agents should be avoided if possible. Most important, the long-term administration of neuroleptics should be prescribed only for patients with schizophrenia and not for those with conditions that respond to other treatments.",

Current and lifetime histories of depression in the adolescents were highly comorbid with several other mental disorders. The adults had a lower but statistically significant degree of comorbidity, primarily with substance use disorder. Depression in both groups was more likely to occur after the other disorder rather than to precede it. Comorbidity did not affect the duration or severity of depression. Comorbidity in the adolescents was associated with greater frequency of suicidal behavior and treatment seeking.

From a scientific viewpoint, it is justified, however, it does not necessarily agree with clinical priority. Adverse effects slightly affect these guidelines. Most adverse effects that were considered in the development of guidelines for NP including FM were short-term adverse effects such as drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, and dry mouth. However, the long-term adverse effects such as cognitive dysfunction, dependence or abuse, sexual dysfunction, fracture, and osteoporosis also should be considered in medication. The adverse effects of pregabalin are cognitive dysfunction, dependence or abuse, obesity, marked drowsiness (sometimes loss of consciousness), and an expensive drug price. The adverse effects of duloxetine are cognitive dysfunction, dementia, sexual dysfunction, and bleeding and the drug price is expensive. Tricyclic antidepressants are safer than serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors in terms of dementia or cognitive dysfunction. The price of amitriptyline is inexpensive and most adverse effects except obesity disappear as soon as it is discontinued. Many studies have shown the analgesic effect of amitriptyline in FM and NP. However, scientific evidence of efficacy is low, because they are old studies. In clinical practice, efficacy based on personal experience, adverse effects based on personal experience and scientific evidence, drug price, and degree of offlabel use in addition to scientific evidence of efficacy should be reflected in the order of priority. Pregabalin and duloxetine should be administered after amitriptyline in medication treatment for NP including FM.",

      "title": "Child abuse and neglect: psychiatric and neuro-biological consequences",
      "abstract": "Child abuse and neglect is a common problem that is potentially damaging to long-term physical and psychological health of children. Over the past, researchers have documented this relationship and have identified two possible mechanisms that can explain the increased incidence of childhood stress and consequent adult somatic disease: the increased incidence of health harming behaviors and causes epigenetic and other changes that predispose individuals to disease through a raised non-specific inflammatory profile [1]. Abuse survivors, as well as persons who have experienced other types of childhood adversities, are more likely to participate in high-risk behaviors [2]. Possible etiologic factors in survivors' health problems include abuse-related alterations in brain functioning that can increase vulnerability to stress and decrease immune function. Adult survivors are also more likely to participate in risky behaviors that undermine health or to have cognitions and beliefs that amplify health problems [2].\r\n\r\nChildhood abuse and early life stress may become hard-coded into the genome, creating an epigenetic memory of events that leads to impaired health at a later date [3].\r\n\r\nChronic early life stress results in long-term changes in HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis function and regulation typified by hypersecretion of CRH and ACTH. The initial hypersecretion of cortisol may over time lead to blunting of the cortisol response to CRH and ACTH and relative glucocorticoid resistance. A decrease in glucocorticoid levels or impaired glucocorticoid receptor function might then lead to increased stress responsiveness [2].\r\n\r\nChildhood abuse and neglect is also associated with reduced adult hippocampal volume, particularly on the left side, and these findings support the hypothesis that exposure to early stress in humans, as in other animals, affects hippocampal subfield development [4].\r\n\r\nAnother recent study demonstrate that children who experienced two or more types of violence exposure showed significantly accelerated telomere erosion from age-5 baseline to age-10 follow-up measurement compared with children who had one type of violence exposure or who were not exposed to violence [5].\r\n\r\nPeople experience and interpret physical and emotional insults in diverse ways and many contextual factors affect the phenomenology of abuse and neglect, and in Italy there are many children victims of various types of maltreatment particularly within their own families. But we must not forget the most vulnerable children who may have even more serious consequences: those who live in foster care [6] or abandoned babies [7] that are actually little-known but that equally needs of social interventions, health and human rights.",

She may have answered our questions in a way showing that at the time there was not only a consciousness of a certain kind present, but also the capacity for understanding and replying in accordance with her ideas (however unfounded they may, in fact, be), and yet on recovery, or even in a temporary lucid interval, all remembrance of the disordered state has passed away, and that, too, beyond the capacity of recall—nothing but a misty, hazy remembrance of some condition which has been passed through remains, just as one finds it impossible to re-instate the details of a dream, the reality of which was at the time vivid in consciousness. We have here to deal with a dual consciousness, a knowledge of states apparently incompatible with, and distinct from, each other. We are all familiar with states of acute mental disturbance where there is difficulty in making the patient understand what we are saying—not necessarily difficult or involved questions, but simple queries relating to what we think are matters in the patient‘s consciousness, such as it is. Here it is doubtful if the patients really understand what we are saying, though there is no doubt about their hearing the question, e.g. , they may hear the question but the reply will be merely the reiteration of some particular delusion which has no connection with the question, or there need not be any reply at all, as if we were addressing them in a foreign language which they did not understand, or as if what is said to them has a different meaning from what is intended.",

The former are, mainly, recency effects, while the latter intervene in the early stage of the performance. Chaotic-like sequences can be recognized by the presence, within them, of greater variations. Factors producing accelerations or decelerations of temporal parameters, i.e. inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) and reaction latencies, and changes in other parameters, i.e. numbers of pauses, freezings and errors, depend on two orders of variability, a neural order (here we refer to degrees of excitability of different cortical and subcortical systems and temporal dissociations between their activities), and a psychological order (levels of attention, expectation, habituation and fatigue).",

      "abstract": "Les états de mal non convulsifs et confusionnels sont classiquement séparés en deux formes, l’état d’absence (EA) et l’état de mal partiel complexe (EMPC). Le diagnostic est difficile sur la base des seuls éléments cliniques et nécessite un électroencéphalogramme (EEG) d’urgence. L’EA ou « petit mal status » est la forme la plus fréquente d’états de mal non convulsifs et confusionnels. Il est caractérisé par une confusion fluctuante, d’intensité variable, souvent associée à des myoclonies périoculaires. L’EEG montre des décharges critiques généralisées qui cèdent sous benzodiazépines alors que la conscience se normalise. Les EA possèdent une importante hétérogénéité nosographique. Quatre groupes peuvent être individualisés : EA typiques s’inscrivant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie généralisée idiopathique, EA atypiques survenant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie généralisée symptomatique ou cryptogénique, EA « de novo » de l’adulte caractérisés par des facteurs de provocation toxiques ou métaboliques, EA avec éléments focaux s’observant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie partielle préexistante. Les EMPC temporaux sont caractérisés par des décharges temporales continues ou récurrentes et peuvent être organisés de façon cyclique, cette présentation étant caractéristique mais rare. Ils nécessitent un traitement énergique en raison de leur résistance et du risque de séquelles cognitives. Les EMPC frontaux constituent un défi diagnostique. Ils sont en effet souvent inauguraux, de présentation clinique déroutante et symptomatiques d’une lésion focale dans un cas sur trois. Nonconvulsive confusional status epilepticus is classically divided on the basis of the ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) into absence status (AS) and complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Based on clinical semiology alone, diagnosis is difficult and requires emergent EEG. AS is a polymorphic condition that can complicate many epileptic syndromes. Confusion of varying intensity is associated in half of the cases with bilateral periocular myoclonias. Clinical and EEG normalization is obtained after intravenous benzodiazepine injection. From a nosographic point of view, four types of AS may be recognized. Typical AS occurs as part of an idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Atypical AS occurs in patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic generalized epilepsies. “De novo” AS of late onset is characterized by toxic or metabolic precipitating factors in middle-aged subjects with no previous history of epilepsy. AS with focal characteristics occur in subjects with a preexisting or newly developing partial epilepsy, most often of extratemporal origin. Most cases are transitional forms between these four entities. CPSE is characterized by continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures, which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. Cyclic disturbance of consciousness characterizes CPSE of temporal lobe origin that requires vigorous treatment to prevent recurrence or cognitive sequelae. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, symptoms are unusual and patients should be documented extensively. A focal frontal lesion is revealed in one third of cases.",

      "title": "Functional cognitive disorder: dementia’s blind spot",
      "abstract": "Abstract An increasing proportion of cognitive difficulties are recognized to have a functional cause, the chief clinical indicator of which is internal inconsistency. When these symptoms are impairing or distressing, and not better explained by other disorders, this can be conceptualized as a cognitive variant of functional neurological disorder, termed functional cognitive disorder (FCD). FCD is likely very common in clinical practice but may be under-diagnosed. Clinicians in many settings make liberal use of the descriptive term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for those with cognitive difficulties not impairing enough to qualify as dementia. However, MCI is an aetiology-neutral description, which therefore includes patients with a wide range of underlying causes. Consequently, a proportion of MCI cases are due to non-neurodegenerative processes, including FCD. Indeed, significant numbers of patients diagnosed with MCI do not ‘convert’ to dementia. The lack of diagnostic specificity for MCI ‘non-progressors’ is a weakness inherent in framing MCI primarily within a deterministic neurodegenerative pathway. It is recognized that depression, anxiety and behavioural changes can represent a prodrome to neurodegeneration; empirical data are required to explore whether the same might hold for subsets of individuals with FCD. Clinicians and researchers can improve study efficacy and patient outcomes by viewing MCI as a descriptive term with a wide differential diagnosis, including potentially reversible components such as FCD. We present a preliminary definition of functional neurological disorder–cognitive subtype, explain its position in relation to other cognitive diagnoses and emerging biomarkers, highlight clinical features that can lead to positive diagnosis (as opposed to a diagnosis of exclusion), and red flags that should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses. In the research setting, positive identifiers of FCD will enhance our recognition of individuals who are not in a neurodegenerative prodrome, while greater use of this diagnosis in clinical practice will facilitate personalized interventions.",

Adverse events as the Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome we observed in our clinical practice, at 33% patients treated with serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. The most frequent reactions were dizziness, sleep disturbances (insomnia, vivid dreams), agitation, anxiety, headache. Typically, these symptoms were mild. They usually occurred within the first few days after treatment cessation. Long-term antidepressant discontinuation syndromes, which include psychiatric disorders – excitement, anxiety, dysphoric reactions, fatigue, cognitive impairment can last from month or to six years (S.

He did not have enough concentration and energy for his daily work and developed depression and anxiety because of his excessive daytime sleepiness. During his insomniac state, a drug treatment provided partial relief, but the effects were not long-lasting. Consequently, the drug dosage increased, and major side effects gradually manifested. We decided to use a completely new therapeutic strategy for this patient to improve his sleep quality and mental symptoms. In time, the patient could stop oral medications and that is multimodal sleep. After the end of multimodal sleep, the patient typically experiences improvement in sleep quality and architecture. Additionally, the dosage of hypnotics used before multimodal sleep is discontinued without severe withdrawal symptoms.Zhang J-F, Williams JP, Zhao Q-N, et al.

The concept of mind and associated mood states defended here is that they are physically emergent, subjective, qualitative, unified features of the brain. We compared our neurobiological assessment also to psychoanalytical practice (first person's perspective). Argument Applied to recent work on major depressive disorder ( MDD ), our ideas are among other supported by clinical and experimental studies on sleep deprivation, deep brain stimulation and epidemiological assessments of time‐to‐recovery. Clinical implications We suggest that depression is a transient state of the brain, that is mutually exclusive to the state of pleasure (in the F reudian context), rather than a disorder or disease with a characteristic time course (like many reversible somatic diseases). MDD can best be described with stochastic transition models, which is discussed in the context of a presumed brain serotonin dysfunction in depression. Our ideas invite a reconsideration of some concepts underlying current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the clinical practice.",

      "title": "The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders Leon C. Lack1* 1 Flinders University, Australia Sleepiness is determined biologically by two comparable but independent factors: homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm sleep drive. The circadian sleepiness varies with a host of synchronised endogenous physiological and hormonal rhythms across the 24-hour period. Normal entrainment of this circadian system favours sleep at night (aprox. 2300-0700h) and alertness/productivity during the day. However, abnormalities of the circadian system in timing or amplitude can cause chronic or short term difficulties sleeping when desired and being alert when necessary. Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) results from a 2-6 hour delay from normal of the circadian system making it impossible to initiate sleep before 0100h. Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) results from an abnormally early timed circadian system making it impossible to maintain sleep past 0300h. Free-running rhythms do not remain stable in the 24-hour period but tend to drift later making night-time sleep and daytime alertness difficult for periods of days or weeks. Jet-lag and shiftwork usually produce short-lived sleep/wake problems. Since the most common disorders are from abnormal timing of the circadian system, tools to re-time circadian rhythms such as retinal light stimulation and exogenous melatonin administration can be used to treat these disorders. Light intensity, duration, and wavelength are important dimensions for treatment effect. However, the timing of light is critical for the effectiveness of these treatments. Bright light stimulation pushes the endogenous sleep period away from it like similar poles on a bar magnet (e.g. south/south) while the time of melatonin administration pulls the endogenous sleep period towards it like two opposite magnetic poles (e.g. north/south). The ‘push’ and ‘pull’ effects can be combined to shepherd the endogenous sleep period into the desired time (e.g. 2300-0700h). Other behavioural procedures and cognitive therapies can also be helpful in the treatment of these problematic circadian rhythm disorders.

      "title": "Acute and chronic whiplash disorders - a review",
      "abstract": "This review examines acute and chronic whiplash-associated disorders to facilitate assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for further research and evidence-based practices.A review of the literature.Whiplash-associated disorders account for a large proportion of the overall impairment and disability caused by traffic injuries. Rarely can a definite injury be determined in the acute (or chronic) phase. Crash-related factors have been identified, and several trauma mechanisms possibly causing different injuries have been described. Most whiplash trauma will not cause injury, and the majority of patients (92-95%) will return to work. Litigation is not a major factor. Cognitive impairments are not the same as brain injury. Variables such as pain intensity, restricted motion, neurological symptoms and signs, together with central nervous system symptoms can be used to predict a situation with risk of remaining complaints. Influences of other factors--the same as for other chronic pain conditions--also exist. Persistent/chronic pain is not merely acute pain that persists over time; changes occur at different levels of the pain transmission system. Chronic whiplash-associated disorders are associated with problems concerning social functioning, daily anxieties and satisfaction with different aspects of life. Adequate information, advice and pain medication together with active interventions might be more effective in the acute stage. Early multidisciplinary rehabilitation focusing on cognitive-behavioural changes might be of value. To develop specific treatment and rehabilitation, it is important to identify homogenous subgroups.",

El estado mental podria ser dificil de valorar durante la agitacion extrema, en cuyo caso el aislamiento y la obtencion de informacion de fuentes apropiadas pordria ser crucial para iniciar un tratamiento racional y adecuado. Para prevenir danos al paciente y a otras personas, la intervencion farmacologica debe ser inmediata, concordante y autoevaluatoria. Se recomienda una combinacion de 5 a 10 mgs de haloperidol mas 4 mgs de lorazepam por via intramuscular cada 30 minutos. El registro del grado de agitacion en una escala de 100 puntos, proporciona la retroalimentacion necesaria para proseguir, revalorar, o concluir el tratamiento, dependiendo de los resultados obtenidos. Si el grado de agitacion es superior a los treinta puntos en la escala de agitacion, no se recomienda mantener al paciente sin el beneficio del tratamiento farmacologico. De ser posible, debe evitarse la sedacion. La combinacion de haloperidol-lorazepam es la mejor porque no tiene efectos extrapiramidales y requiere 50% menos de haloperidol. Si no se logra la sedacion en menos de seis horas, despues de una dosis total de 60 mgs de haloperidol y 8 mgs de lorazepam, administrados por via intramuscular, entonces se recomienda aplicar la combinacion por via endovenosa.",

Alcohol addiction encompasses a three-stage cycle that becomes more intense as alcohol use progresses: <italic>binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect</italic>, and <italic>preoccupation/anticipation</italic>. These stages engage neuroadaptations in brain circuits that involve the basal ganglia (reward hypofunction), extended amygdala (stress sensitization), and prefrontal cortex (executive function disorder). This chapter discusses key neuroadaptations in the hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic stress systems and the critical role of glucocorticoid receptors. These neuroadaptations contribute to negative emotional states that powerfully drive compulsive alcohol drinking and seeking. These changes in association with a disruption of prefrontal cortex function that lead to cognitive deficits and poor decision making contribute to the chronic relapsing nature of alcohol dependence.",

      "abstract": "Introducción: En salud mental es frecuente observar comorbilidad entre trastornos mentales severos y trastornos por uso de sustancias. En estados donde destaca la desinhibición, como la manía en el Trastorno Bipolar, es posible que un paciente no consumidor realice consumos de sustancias adictivas que pueden influir en el curso de la enfermedad. En algunas ocasiones éste consumo puede limitarse únicamente al episodio, sin cristalizar en un trastorno adictivo o sin implicar una recaída. Bajo esta premisa presentamos el siguiente caso clínico. Descripción del Caso: Paciente mujer de 52 años con diagnóstico de Trastorno Esquizafectivo tipo Bipolar ingresada en Hospital de Día de Salud Mental de Mataró por episodio maníaco en remisión parcial. Durante el ingreso se objetiva un consumo de 3 paquetes diarios de tabaco en contexto de episodio maníaco, con abstinencia previa de 6 años de evolución. Una vez resuelto el cuadro la paciente detiene el consumo de forma brusca y sin craving objetivable. Pruebas complementarias: Se realiza analítica completa con hemograma, bioquímica, perfil hepatorenal, lipídico y tiroideo, vitamina B12 y folato sin alteraciones significativas. Tratamiento: Previamente la paciente había mantenido estabilidad con Palmitato de Paliperidona 150mg/mes en monoterapia. Durante el ingreso se añade Valproato sódico hasta 1000mg (valproemia 80.28) y Lormetazepam 1mg. Discusión: Las sustancias adictivas generan cambios neurológicos que predisponen al reinicio del consumo si se expone al paciente nuevamente al tóxico a pesar de haber mantenido una abstinencia prolongada. En este caso observamos como la paciente es capaz de detener el consumo de tabaco de forma abrupta y sin craving una vez resuelto el cuadro, a pesar de haber sido una consumidora importante en el pasado. Dada la gran prevalencia del tabaquismo en pacientes con patología mental grave, podría ser relevante conocer esta posibilidad para establecer un tratamiento más o menos enfocado a prevenir una recaída.",

      "title": "The 4I Hypothesis: A Neuro-Immunological Explanation for Characteristic Symptoms of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Characteristic symptoms of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) are (muscle) weakness, muscle pain, cognitive deficits, neurological abnormalities, but above all post-exertional malaise: a long-lasting increase of symptoms after a minor exertion. In contrast, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is primarily defined by 鈥渃hronic fatigue鈥? Since 鈥渃hronic fatigue鈥?is not mandatory for the diagnosis ME, and post-exertional malaise and cognitive deficits are not obligatory for the diagnosis CFS, the case criteria for ME and CFS define two distinct, partly overlapping nosological entities. ME and CFS are considered to be enigmatic diseases, qualified by some authors as 鈥渕edically unexplained syndromes鈥?of 鈥渇unctional syndromes鈥? However, specific abnormalities consistently observed over the years and their direct and indirect sequels can plausibly explain characteristic symptoms, e.g. 鈥渆xhaustion鈥?and pain. Abnormalities established repetitively incorporate immunological aberrations (inflammation, immune activation, immunosuppression, and immune dysfunction), persistent and/or reactivating infections, gastro-intestinal dysbiosis, oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, a (prolonged) deviant response to exertion and orthostatic stress, circulatory deficits, and neurological abnormalities.This article depicts the 4I hypothesis, an explanatory model for ME (CFS) with a central role for four types of immunological abnormalities: inflammation, (Th2-predominated) immune activation, immunosuppression, and immune dysfunction. The potential direct sequels of these abnormalities, e.g. increased oxidative and nitrosative stress, (reactivating or chronic) infections, and their possible indirect consequences, e.g. mitochondrial dysfunction, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) axis hypofunction, and cardiovascular dysregulation, can plausibly explain various distinctive symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g. 鈥渆xhaustion鈥? (muscle) weakness, pain, cognitive deficits, a flu-like feeling, and post-exertional 鈥渕alaise鈥?",

      "title": "Evaluating a Child with Partial Developmental Delay (ParDD), Global Developmental Delay (GDD)/Mental Retardation (MR): Clinical Expertise Based or Evidence-Based?",
      "abstract": "Developmental delay (DD) is a commonly encountered clinical problem. Nearly most children with neurodevelopmental disorders present with developmental delay. The ultimate diagnosis may take months or even years to be confirmed. The final verdict may be purely developmental with a benign outcome, or there might be slow deterioration ending up in a more sinister cause like neurodegenerative diseases. At times, the developmental course might plateau off with the final developmental outcome underachieved. With standardized assessment at a later age, these children could then be labeled as suffering from \"mental retardation (MR) or \"intellectual disability\" (ID). Thus, the crucial issue during the process of making the final diagnosis for any child presenting with developmental delay is when can one decide that an etiological diagnosis can confidently be made during the phase of development. When can one be really sure that there is no underlying organic cause to account for the developmental delay. Often than not, the clinician is faced with the dilemma of how exhaustive one should persue in investigating a case of DD, and when to stop investigating further. It is very important for us to develop a logical and practical approach in managing these DD children at the \"first\" presentation and to establish ones clinical judgment to find the \"Best timing\" for referral or diagnostic workup. The first step to the approach is the awareness and the differentiation of Partial Developmental Delay (ParDD) from Global Developmental Delay (GDD). We aim to provide the readers an understanding of a practical and evidence based approach for the diagnostic evaluation of a child with DD/MR. We hope this approach can help to improve the diagnostic yield of DD/MR.

      "abstract": "Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) and the syndrome of continuous spikes and waves during slow wave sleep (CSWS) are two points on the spectrum of functional childhood epileptic encephalopathies. They are characterized by a severe paroxysmal EEG disturbance that may permanently alter the critical synaptogenesis by strengthening synaptic contacts that should have been naturally \"pruned.\" The much more common benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is also related to LKS and CSWS by a common pathophysiology. Although prognosis in LKS and CSWS for seizure control is good, cognitive function declines and permanent neuropsychologic dysfunction is seen in many cases. This permanent damage is most evident in those patients who had early-onset EEG abnormality and a prolonged active phase of continuous spike-and-wave discharges during sleep. If the active phase of paroxysmal activity persists for over 2 to 3 years, even successful treatment does not resolve neuropsychologic sequelae. In LKS, the paroxysmal activity permanently affects the posterior temporal area and results in auditory agnosia and language deficits; in CSWS, the frontal lobes are more involved and other cognitive disturbances predominate. Aggressive treatment should include high-dose antiepileptic drugs, corticosteroids, and surgery in specific cases",

To discuss the features of what may be described as a 'reaction to a drug' in order to highlight those suggestive of allergy, side-effect or intolerance, and what implications this might have for the future use or avoidance of the drug.Assessment of an ADR may apply to a current reaction or a history of a past reaction. The main decision is whether to cease the drug and/or whether it can be used again. Some ADRs are serious and likely to be reproducible and constitute absolute contraindications, whereas others are mild and may or may not occur on subsequent exposure. The mechanism of the ADR may be helpful in risk assessment. Drug allergy has immunological mechanisms: it may be severe, tends to be reproducible and may cross-react with structurally related drugs. Drug side-effects are more common and predictable, vary in severity and depend on the drug's pharmacological action. Intolerance tends to be less severe, and may depend on susceptibility factors, which can vary. The decision to prescribe a drug where there is a history of a previous ADR requires careful assessment of the risks and potential benefits.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Changes in consciousness are seen in a range of physiological and pathological settings including sleep, anaesthesia, brain lesions, metabolic disturbances, and complex partial or generalized seizures. In neurobiological terms, consciousness may be viewed as having an arousal dimension and an awareness dimension phenotypically expressed as the capacity to respond to self or environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness is associated with lesions that disrupt neuronal systems in the brainstem and diencephalon that mediate arousal or thalamocortical or corticocortical systems that mediate awareness. As there are many causes of unconsciousness, a timely and focused history and neurologic examination are critical to defining the differential diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "A wide spectrum of disorders, ranging from intracranial hemorrhage to hypoglycemia, present with impaired consciousness as a leading symptom. The duration of these periods of impaired consciousness varies from less than a minute (for example, in syncope) to days and weeks at a time, with certain patients confined to a lifetime of disordered consciousness in states such as minimally conscious state (MCS) and persistent vegetative state (PVS). As improvements in medical science and technology increase the survival of patients in states of impaired consciousness, the problem of properly differentiating between these states and recognizing their causes early on steadily grows in importance. The basis for establishing a correct diagnosis of these disorders is, perhaps even more so than in other areas of clinical neurology, a strong grasp of neuroanatomy and its skillful application in the neurological examination. The ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) of the brainstem, the main pathway regulating wakefulness and sleep, lies in close proximity to certain nuclei whose function can be clinically tested even in unconscious patients, allowing for localization of a potential focal lesion and assessment of damage. Neuroimaging, laboratory testing and electrophysiological studies can further identify different levels and causes of consciousness disorders. This paper aims to review these potential causes, the pathophysiology of the damage they cause and the specificities in their manifestation that can be used to differentiate between them. Determining the complete absence of brain activity, also known as “brain death”, is an increasingly important issue, especially relevant in transplantation medicine.",

Le terme meme d'antidepresseur le souligne. Il s'agit en effet d'une classe de molécules qui agissent sur un ensemble de comportements définis et sur eux seuls. La question demeure ouverte de savoir comment les modifications neurophysiologiques obtenues par ces molecules agissent sur le comportement. Le fait que nous n'ayons pas une réponse précise à cette question explique sans doute la part importante de la resistance que Ton rencontre encore dans la prescription des antidepresseurs. On ne retrouve pas ce fait pour les neuroleptiques et les tranquillisants, bien que ces derniers présentent des effets secondaires plus nocifs (dyskinésie ou troubles mnésiques par exemple). Une première erreur consiste à confondre cause et mécanisme. Ce n'est pas parce que la chimiotherapie depressive agit sur la symptomatologie que le déficit qu'elle corrige est nécessairement, et encore moins uniquement, la cause de survenue de cet etat. En ce qui concerne les causes, nous devons conserver un point de vue pluraliste et uniciste à la fois en considerant qu'il s'agit d'une «maladie» pluri-factorielle. En termes de mécanisme, notre pensee doit demeurer resolument dualiste et reconnaftre un principe de parallélisme entre événements neurophysiologiques et événements comportementaux. La seconde erreur consiste à confondre liaison synaptique avec le concept classique de centre nerveux. Un exemple de cette confusion nous est peut-être donné par la recherche, jusqu'à présent stérile, de dépressions «noradrénergique» ou «sérotoninergique». Il est fort possible que les molécules dont nous disposons agissent sur des rélais dans un reseau de neurones qui sont impliqués dans les mécanismes comportementaux. La troisième erreur porte sur la manière dont nous traitons l'analyse comportementale de la dépression en se référant à une sémiologie qui a été construite à des fins tout-à-fait différentes (diagnostic d'une maladie et prévision de son évolution). Une analyse comportementale qui voudrait cerner de plus près l'action des molécules devrait renoncer à cette sémiologie et dégager des traits de comportement directement sensibles à l'action des medicaments. A la notion trop vague et trop globale de trouble de l'humeur, il serait sans doute utile de substituer celle de système ou plan d'action et de mecanisme d'interruption ou de ralentissement de l'exécution de ces plans.",

      "title": "A neuroprotective strategy to reduce acute and chronic disability, and slowly progressive central nervous system atrophy in a new model of multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that causes severe neurological deficits, starting in young adulthood. Early in the course of disease the deficits usually manifest as temporary ‘attacks’, or relapses, but later in the disease they manifest as a slowly progressive, irreversible worsening. Relapses are primarily due to impaired neuro/axonal function in the short term, whereas the progressive deficits are principally due to the slow accumulation of neuro/axonal degeneration and tissue atrophy. Regarding therapy, current evidence suggests that the acute neurological deficit can arise from inflammation, even in the absence of demyelination, although the mechanism(s) remain uncertain. Equally uncertain, is the cause of the slowly progressive degeneration and atrophy. Current disease-modifying treatments for MS can reduce the frequency of relapses, but, when they occur, they can still be severe. Steroids can shorten the duration of relapses, but any benefit regarding disability in the long-term is negligible. There are no very effective therapies to prevent progressive disease, and developing a therapy is hampered by the lack of an accepted animal model. Here, we introduce a new animal model of MS which causes severe neurological deficits with a time course similar to that in MS. Thus, acute deficits arise in young adulthood from CNS inflammation in the absence of demyelination, and chronic, progressive deficits accumulate throughout life due to neurodegeneration and atrophy. In MS, damage to the grey matter, particularly that of the spinal cord, correlates more precisely with the progression of disability than damage to the white matter, and here we describe a new animal model that leads to post-inflammatory, slowly progressive disability resulting from damage to the spinal grey matter. We aim to use the model to explore the mechanisms responsible for both acute and chronic deficit, and to identify a rational and effective strategy for neuroprotection. The lesion is induced in the rat spinal cord by the unilateral, intraspinal injection of pro- inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS, or saline control) into the ventral horn at the 13th thoracic vertebra. The lesion consists of a period of acute inflammation, characterized by oedema and local tissue hypoxia, which peaks at 48 hours post-injection, subsiding within 4 days. The inflammatory lesion is accompanied by the expression of a neurological deficit, namely hind limb and tail weakness, both of which subside within 4 days. Interestingly, the acute inflammatory lesion is gradually replaced over the lifetime by a slowly progressive degeneration of the previously inflamed grey matter, resembling the slow and progressive grey matter degeneration in MS. The progressive degeneration is accompanied by the return of the neurological deficit which gradually worsens over the following months, surpassing the disability observed in the acute stage of the disease, and modelling the slow, relentless accumulation of disability seen in progressive MS. We have used the histological characteristics of the acute inflammatory lesion, including the evidence of hypoxia, to devise a potential therapeutic strategy based on maintaining adequate tissue oxygenation. Two therapies have been explored, namely increasing respiratory oxygen, and use of the vasodilating agent nimodipine. The therapies have been applied acutely, just during the initial period of inflammatory hypoxia. Both therapies were effective in reducing the acute disability, indicating a potential therapy for relapses in MS. Remarkably, both therapies were also effective in reducing both the slowly progressive accumulation of permanent disability and the accompanying atrophy, indicating a therapeutic opportunity to avoid the severity of progressive MS. These observations illuminate the important question in MS of whether the degeneration and atrophy that accompany progressive disease are due to contemporaneous events, or whether they are the delayed consequences of events occurring long before, in the acute inflammatory lesion. In summary, we introduce a new animal model of MS that illuminates the mechanisms contributing to both acute and chronic disability and use the model to identify therapies effective in reducing both acute and chronic disability, and the underlying pathology. The therapies are safe and inexpensive, and are suitable for testing in clinical trial in MS.",

      "title": "Neurobiological outcomes in the offspring of postnatally depressed mothers: Causes and consequences",
      "abstract": "Postnatal depression (PND) is the most common psychological disorder to affect women in the postpartum period, with an estimated prevalence of 13% in high-income countries (Gavin et al. 2005; O’Hara and Swain 1996). In low and middle income countries, the available evidence suggests that rates of PND may be substantially higher, with prevalence estimates ranging from 15 to 57% (Wachs et al. 2009). In terms of clinical presentation, depression occurring in the postnatal period appears to be indistinguishable from depression occurring at other times (Cooper et al., 2007), with persistent low mood and/or a profound loss of interest and enjoyment being defining characteristics. Other symptoms are mood-related disturbances in sleep, altered appetite, concentration impairment, retardation, agitation, feelings of guilt and hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts or impulses. The duration of episodes varies, but the majority of postpartum depressive episodes resolve spontaneously within 6 months to a year (Cooper and Murray 1995; Cox et al. 1993). Although PND may not be unique in terms of the symptom profile, the fact that this disorder occurs in the postpartum period is a particular concern. Specifically, PND affects the mother–infant dyad at a time when the infant is particularly reliant on his or her caregiver to meet their physical, social, and cognitive needs. The postpartum period is also a time when the family unit as a whole is likely to experience additional stress, and is therefore particularly vulnerable. Given these considerations, and the relatively high prevalence of PND, the potential for adverse impact is significant. One area of research focus, reviewed here, has examined the possibility the disturbances in the mother–child relationship occurring in the context of maternal PND result in fundamental alterations in key psychobiological systems in the infant, with persistent consequences. Notably, as PND typically resolves within the first year postpartum, and therefore is particularly relevant to early development, observations deriving from the study of PND in this area offer potentially broad insights into the relevance of early environmental factors to child neurobiological functioning. Given that depressive disorder is characterized by profound impairments in mood, energy levels, motivation, and feelings of self-worth, and has established detrimental effects on interpersonal functioning, it is perhaps unsurprising that mothers with PND have been found to show disturbances in the quality of care that they provide for their infant (for a review, see Murray et al. 2010a).",

Dementia affects several cognitive domains: memory, language, attention, execution function, perceptual and motor skills, and social networking. Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms complicate dementia, being difficult to manage. Depending on the causes and the clinical presentation, there are several types of dementia. Alzheimer dementia is the most common type, and it is believed to be due to the interneuronal deposition of insoluble beta-amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles consisting of tau protein, which eventually lead to neuronal destructions with cholinergic deficiency. The medicines currently used in Alzheimer disease therapy are cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists. These drugs are not disease modifiers and do not address the cause; they act symptomatic-pathogenically, slowing down cognitive decline. Psychiatric and behavioral symptoms associated with dementia are treated with appropriate medication. From the therapeutic regimen of patients with Alzheimer disease it is preferable to eliminate drugs with anticholinergic and sedative effects.",

The pattern of losses experienced in old age differs from that encountered earlier in life; notably, increasingly prevalent physical illness and brain changes may cause psychological stress additional to their neurophysiological impact. DSM-IV diagnostic decisions have proved relatively unhelpful when planning interventions in cases of late-life unipolar depression. Relapse following remission is common, especially if culpable factors (e.g. vascular change or persisting effects of losses) remain in evidence. Understanding how different factors have contributed to diminution of self-esteem, as well as biological depressive features, allows planning of appropriate therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib or cot death are synonyms for the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant. The incidence of SIDS has been estimated to be from 1-2% to 3%. Protracted intrauterine hypoxia or recurrent hypoxic insults during fetal life undoubtedly influence the development of the central nervous structures as a tissue most susceptible to hypoxia, although well developed mechanisms of defense against hypoxia exist during the fetal life. The mechanisms underlying SIDS include neurologically compromised infants who are deprived of compensatory mechanisms during sleep, sustaining a hypoxic insult with alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within the regions involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. Changes in the brain result from perinatal prolonged hypoxia (persistent reticular pathways in the pons and medulla, astroglia in the brainstem, gliosis of brain nerve nuclei, defects in neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal apoptosis, microthrombosis, and hypoxic ischemic lesion). Hypoxic perinatal risk factors for SIDS included passive and active exposure to cigarette smoking in pregnancy, abuse of drugs, alcohol, coffee and medication in pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal hypoxia with or without resuscitation, preeclampsia, anemia in pregnancy, prematurity, multiparity, multiple pregnancy, pregnant women aged < 20 years and > 35 years, cardiocirculatory, pulmonary and endocrine diseases in pregnancy, and short time interval between two pregnancies. As cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to lead to fetoplacental insufficiency, which result in fetal hypoxia, it is concluded that hypoxia is a precondition for the occurrence of SIDS. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke decreases maternal red blood cell count, and concentrations of tyrosine and selenium, reduces fetal and neonatal cerebral blood flow, and increases maternal MCV, leukocytosis, especially neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, maternal and fetal heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resistance index in umbilical artery, fetal hemoglobin, cytokine, serotonine, dopamine, catecholamine, hypoxanthine, endorphin and interleukin-6. Pregnancy at a risk of hypoxia, especially in heavy smokers, is a major risk factor for SIDS, and such pregnancy requires close and intensive antenatal monitoring.",

Abstract Cognitive dysfunction is a core psychopathological domain in major depressive disorder (MDD) and is no longer considered to be a pseudo-specific phenomenon. Cognitive dysfunction in MDD is a principal determinant of patient-reported outcomes, which, hitherto, have been insufficiently targeted with existing multimodal treatments for MDD. The neural structures and substructures subserving cognitive function in MDD overlap with, yet are discrete from, those subserving emotion processing and affect regulation. Several modifiable factors influence the presence and extent of cognitive dysfunction in MDD, including clinical features (e.g., episode frequency and illness duration), comorbidity (e.g., obesity and diabetes), and iatrogenic artefact. Screening and measurement tools that comport with the clinical ecosystem are available to detect and measure cognitive function in MDD. Notwithstanding the availability of select antidepressants capable of exerting procognitive effects, most have not been sufficiently studied or rigorously evaluated. Promising pharmacological avenues, as well as psychosocial, behavioral, chronotherapeutic, and complementary alternative approaches, are currently being investigated.",

A high proportion of patients will have been or will be addicted to drugs. Complicating the anesthetic plan are the acute and chronic impact of drug use on the patient. Acute intoxication can potentiate anesthetics, leading to overdose. Chronic drug abuse can cause end-organ damage and tolerance to anesthetics and require modification of the anesthetic plan. Further complicating the anesthetic plan are the drugs used in medication assistance treatment programs for patients with addiction. The anesthesiologist should also try to limit the use of medications that may trigger an addiction relapse in a patient who is in recovery.",

      "title": "The Acute Encephalopathy of Kwashiorkor",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Children with kwashiorkor often become drowsy after a few days' treatment. This usually passes off, but may deepen into coma with eventual death. This encephalopathy is not due to severe brain disruption, infection, drug toxicity, hypoglycaemia, uraemia or cholaemia. It is associated with an anomalously high hydroxyproline index and a low serum sodium during treatment. No firm conclusions can be made concerning its aetiology, but movements of water and electrolytes across the blood‐brain barrier may play an important role. The effect of standardised stimuli, such as loads of sodium, water or protein, or rapidly acting diuretics on the children's eeg might be of value. RÉSUMÉ Les enfants atteints de kwashiorkor deviennent souvent somnolents après quelques jours de traitement. Le trouble disparait habituellement, mais peut parfois s'aggraver jusqu'au coma et même éventuellement la mort. Cette encéphalopathie n'est pas dûe à une lésion grave du cerveau, à une infection, à un effet toxique de médicament, à une hypoglycémie, urémie ou cholémie. Elle est associée à un index d'hydroxyproline anormalement élevé et à un taux de sodium sérique bas durant le traitement. Il est impossible de tirer des conclusions fermes quant à l'étiologie, mais les mouvements de l'eau et des électrolytes à travers la barrière hémo‐cérébrale pourraient jouer un rôle important. L'effet sur l' eeg de ces enfants d'épreuves standardisées, telles qu'épreuves de charges en sodium, en eau ou en protéine, ou encore l'usage de diurétiques à action rapide pourraient avoir de la valeur. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG An Kwashiorkor leidende Kinder werden oft einige Tage nach Einsetzen der Behandlung schläfrig. In den meisten Fällen sind diese Bewußtseinsänderungen reversible, doch kann sich der Zustand bis zura tödlichen Coma verschlechtern. Diese Encephalopathie wird nicht durch schwere anatomische Hirnveränderungen, durch Infektion, Arzneimittel, Hypoglykämie, Urämie orde Cholämie verursacht. Die Schläfrigkeit tritt in Verbindung mit einem erhöhten Hydroxyprolin‐Index und einem niedrigen Serum‐Natriumgehalt während der Behandlung auf. Es gibt bisher keine sicheren Hinweise für die Ätiologie, es ist aber möglich, daß Verteilungsstörungen von Wasser und Electrolyten an der Bluthirnschranke eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Dosierte Reizeffekte auf das Electroencephalogramm sowie Belastungen mit Natrium, Wasser oder Protein sowie schnellwirksame Diuretika könnten eventuell einen positiven Effekt haben. RESUMEN Niftos afectos de kwashiorkor se ponen muchas veces soñolientos después de algunos días de tratamiento. Generalmente se recuperan de este estado, pero a veces caen en un coma y por fin fallecen. Esta encefalopatía no es debida a disrupción grave del cerebro, infección, toxicidad de drogas, hipoglucemia, uremia, ni colemia. Es asociada a un índice exageradamente elevado de hidroxiprolina y a valores bajos de sodio en el suero durante el tratamiento. No es posible hacer conclusiones firmes sobre su etiología, pero movimientos de agua y de electrolitos a través de la barrera sangre‐cerebro pueden ser importantes. Es posible que el efecto en los eeg de los niños de estímulos normalizados tales cargas de sodio, agua, o proteína, o diuréticos de acción rápida, sería de valor.",

Yet, excessive daytime sleepiness is not only common, and it often goes unrecognized. It can contribute to accidents, produce or exacerbate health conditions, reduce efficiency and productivity, interfere with social relationships, and diminish quality of life. The spectrum of common sleep disorders includes circadian rhythm changes, shiftwork requirements, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, also known as insomnia. In many cases, however, sleep deprivation is the choice of the patient, chosen in response to long commutes, academic rigor, or occupational matters. Regardless of the sleep disorder that a patient has, good sleep behavior or \"sleep hygiene\" is essential.",

The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

      "title": "Mixed dementia and hyperactive delirium: a diagnostic challenge",
      "abstract": "It is well recognised that acute confusion or delirium complicates up to 10% of acute medical admissions. Disorientation in time and place with an impaired short-term memory and conscious level are the hallmarks of an acute confusion. In delirium, disorders of perception may produce restlessness and agitation. A similar state during the final days of life is termed ‘terminal delirium’. Less than 10% of affected individuals will have a primary neurological disorder, for example, dementia, a neurodegenerative disease with varying aetiologies. Currently there are at least 50 million people globally suffering from dementia rendering it a global healthcare problem. Mixed dementia (MD) can be defined as a cognitive decline sufficient to impair independent functioning in daily life resulting from the coexistence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cerebrovascular pathology. MD occurs in patients with a neurodegenerative disorder, such as AD, Lewy body or Pick’s disease and additionally cerebrovascular disease. The mechanistic synergisms between the coexisting pathologies affecting dementia risk, progression and the ultimate clinical manifestations remain elusive. Although AD can be diagnosed with a considerable degree of accuracy, the distinction between isolated AD, vascular dementia and MD, when both pathologies coexist in the same patient remains one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges because their clinical presentation can overlap. Neuropathological studies indicate that mixed vascular Alzheimer’s dementia (MD) has a prevalence of 22% in the elderly. The authors present the case of a 78-year-old man with a diagnosis of MD presenting to the emergency department with delirium, a common but serious acute neuropsychiatric syndrome with the core features of inattention and global cognitive dysfunction. This case demonstrates the challenges in establishing a diagnosis in patients presenting with MD and shows that a cognitive assessment at presentation in a delirious state offers very little diagnostic information. It is therefore suggested to conduct a routine cognitive function examination on patients with dementia to anticipate new neurological signs and/or symptoms thus allowing earlier diagnosis and treatment. However, a baseline cognitive assessment when the patient was well, duration and nature of deterioration as well as collateral history will help differentiate delirium from an underlying dementia.",

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

Im Verlauf der letzten vier Jahre entwickelte sich bei der Patientin jeweils unmittelbar nach einer einwöchigen Hungerperiode eine akute paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose, die 3-mal stationär behandelt werden musste. Psychotische Prodromalsymptome waren vor und zu Beginn der Hungerzeit nicht eruierbar, so dass ein kausaler Zusammenhang zwischen dem Hungern und der psychotischen Dekompensation gesehen werden kann. Anhand dieser Kasuistik wird die Hypothese diskutiert, dass während des Hungerns im Rahmen der Anorexia nervosa temporär eine Hyperaktivität des dopaminergen Systems entstehen könnte und dadurch der Übergang in eine paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose erklärbar wäre. Der Fall zeigt, dass bei vulnerablen Patienten mit einer ähnlichen Anamnese von einer Hungerkur oder anderen eingreifenden Diätmaßnahmen dringend abgeraten werden muss. Der Hinweis auf das erhöhte Psychoserisiko könnte so einen therapeutischen Nutzen für die Behandlung der Anorexia nervosa bei solchen Patienten haben.",

Forensic Neuropsychology establishes an expert valuation of the brain-injured patient (or supposed), or of the law offender people (or supposed) requiring law protection due to their illness. This discipline has a fundamental role in the study of cerebral organic syndromes, particularly in the dementias. DEVELOPMENT. The demential syndrome is common to a group of diseases as degenerative or cardiovascular disorders, brain tumors, syphilis, alcoholism or toxic factors, etc. When speaking of dementia we refer to a syndrome characterized by a progressive and global deterioration of the cognitive functions (memory, language, attention, space-temporal orientation, praxis, thinking, etc.) with preservation of the level of conscience (DSM-IV). This symptomatology affects the personality of the individual as reasonable being , as well as to his behavior and social adaptation. The decrease or loss of the intellectual and volitives abilities of the affected person of a demential syndrome, if it is permanent, also implies a change in its legal situation, since its legal capacity is altered. Therefore, it will be necessary to adopt protective measures for his person and his patrimony. Even if it is necessary, to promote a process of disability, whose sentence will be emitted by a judge, who will indicate: the degree of the mentioned disability, the trusteeship regime and who is designated as a legal tutor.",

      "abstract": "Research into the nature and extent of cognitive dysfunction in patients suffering from bipolar disorder has increased greatly over the last 10 years because the dysfunction is known to persist even if the mood symptoms are in remission and can influence a patient’s psychosocial functioning.To provide an overview of 1) the nature and extent of cognitive dysfunction in bipolar patients; 2) clinically relevant factors such as illness characteristics, comorbidity and psychotropic/psychoactive drugs and 3) the consequences of cognitive dysfunction.We searched the literature in PubMed using the following search terms: bipolar disorder, neuropsychological, cognitive functioning, cognition, functional outcome, determinants, psychotropic/psychoactive drugs.Attentional deficits, memory lapses and aberrant executive functioning occur in both manic and depressive episodes, and may persist even in absence of mood symptoms. The precise cause of cognitive dysfunction is unknown. Persistent cognitive dysfunction frequently interferes with daily functioning.Since the treatment of bipolar patients is nowadays directed towards complete recovery rather than symptomatic remission, it is important to take into account the possibility that these patients are also suffering from cognitive dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Les crises psychogènes non épileptiques (CPNE) sont définies comme des changements brutaux et paroxystiques du comportement moteur, des sensations ou de la conscience qui ressemblent à des crises épileptiques. Ces crises sont en rapport avec des processus psychogènes complexes et non avec une décharge neuronale excessive. Les CPNE sont une pathologie fréquente, coûteuse et grave dont l’incidence équivaut à celle de la sclérose en plaques. Pourtant, cette pathologie reste peu et mal connue des psychiatres. Beaucoup d’entre nous pensent que ces crises ont disparu après Charcot. En effet, actuellement, ces patients sont adressés aux neurologues. Un quart des patients vus par un épileptologue souffrent de CPNE. L’étiopathogénie est multifactorielle, comprenant des facteurs pédisposants, des facteurs déclenchants et des facteurs de maintien. Deux mécanismes principaux apparaissent : une prédisposition neurobiologique et des facteurs traumatiques inducteurs de processus dissociatif. Les modèles récents placent la dysrégulation émotionnelle au centre de la problématique. L’imagerie fonctionnelle a mis en évidence des anomalies fonctionnelles entre les aires cérébrales impliquées dans les émotions et les aires motrices. Il existe aussi des perturbations des 3 composantes émotionnelles : sur le plan cognitif avec une alexithymie chez 85 % des patients et des biais attentionnels pour les stimuli négatifs ; sur le plan comportemental avec une réponse d’évitement et sur le plan physiologique avec des taux de cortisol basal augmentés et une diminution de l’arythmie sinusale. Nous exposerons les résultats de notre étude comparative prospective inédite qui compare la réponse électrodermale à des stimuli visuels entre un groupe de patientes CPNE et de témoins sains appariés. Nous avons mis en évidence des perturbations de la réponse neuro-végétative avec une hyporéceptivité aux stimuli plaisants et une corrélation négative entre la propension à la dissociation et l’amplitude de la réponse électrodermale. Ces résultats ouvrent des perspectives en termes de compréhension des mécanismes mais aussi en termes diagnostique et thérapeutique pour développer des outils psychothérapiques de rééducation émotionnelle chez les patients souffrant de CPNE.",

      "abstract": "A broader palette of safe and better-tolerated agents is available for treating people suffering from chronic schizophrenia, depressive disorders, anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorders. However, current medical treatments are still only partially effective, and highly-prevalent psychiatric disorders continue to represent a huge personal and socio-economic burden. Most pharmacological agents sometimes induce a variety of severe movement disorders, including dystonia or dyskinesia, with an acute, subacute or more chronic time course. More extensive cerebral condition, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome or the serotonin syndrome may be induced by antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Medications commonly involve dopamine receptor blockers, antidepressants and anti-epileptics, among many others. Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia [1]. The traditional and atypical neuroleptics sometimes induce dystonic reactions, akathisia, parkinsonism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, tremor, hyperkinesia and movement disorders [1]. A better understanding of the impact of these drug-induced adverse effects may provide new strategies to develop novel neuroleptics with less adverse metabolic effects and to develop complementary medical therapies to patients treated with antipsychotic medication [2]. The lack of success in discovering more effective pharmacotherapy has contributed, together with many other factors, to a relative few useful findings on new drug targets for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Drug abuse is associated with many medical problems and complications stemming both from regular use and from overdoses. Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

When a young patient continues to describe this type of phenomenon for a year or more I become suspicious of a psychogenic problem. Episodic visual symptomatology resembling persistence of after-images may occur in patients with occipital or occipitoparietal disease. Critchley has discussed these problems in an article entitled \"Types of Visual Perseveration: `Palinopsia' and 'Illusory Visual Spread'\" (<i>Brain</i>74:267-299, 1951). These rare visual symptoms occur against a background of frank neurologic disease. Only rarely in such patients has the time span of the retinal after-image been abnormally prolonged.

Old age is accompanied by important changes in the person’s self perception and perception of the environment; although depression in the elderly is not different from depression in young age, clinical data have evidentiated a particular type of depressive disorder related to old age, characterized by: motivational deficiency, low concentration and attention capacity, psychomotor impairment, which are frequently accompanied by several organic degenerative diseases. Many times, depression of the elderly is underdiagnosed and remains insufficiently treated.

      "title": "Minor Depression and 'Subthreshold' Anxiety Symptoms in Older Adults: Psychosocial Therapies and Special Considerations",
      "abstract": "GENERATIONS A new focus on these common causes of distress and impairment. In recent years more attention has been given to identifying and treating mental disorders in older adults. By and large, these efforts have focused on disorders delineated in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Sta/Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). However, another class of disorders is also beginning to receive attention: mental disorders. Although these sets of symptoms do not meet the full criteria to be classified as specific mental disorders, they are nonetheless associated with clinically significant distress or impairment (Pincus, Davis, and McQueen,1999). In this article we will discuss two specific conditions, and subthreshold generalized anxiety disorder, and the evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial therapies for these conditions for older adults. MINOR DEPRESSION Minor depression is typically defined as the presence of at least two but fewer than five depressive symptoms, including depressed mood or loss of interest in normal daily activities, during the same two-week period with no history of major depressive episode or dysthymic disorder but with clinically significant impairment or distress (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Minor depression is highly prevalent in older adults in the community (9.9 percent) (Hybels, Blazer, and Pieper, 2001) and in primary care (5.2 percent) (Lyness et al., 1999). In mixed-age samples minor depression has been shown to be associated with levels of functional impairment comparable to those caused by medical illnesses (Wells et al., 1992) and with increased expenditures on medical care (Johnson, Weissman, and Klerman, 1992). Morbidity has been less extensively studied in samples of older adults, but the morbidity rates of elders with minor depression may be assumed to be at least comparable to samples with medical illnesses given the higher prevalence of complicating medical conditions. A recent study has shown minor depression to be associated with an increased risk for mortality in older men (Penninx et al., 1999). Although assessment of the prevalence of minor depression in racial and ethnic minority populations tends to be clouded by linguistic and cultural differences in expressing affective and somatic symptoms, recent research taking into account these measurement challenges indicates that minor depression is very common in older ethnic minorities in primary care. According to Arean and Alvidrez (2001), as many as io percent of older African Americans, 15 percent of older Latinos, and 12 percent of older Asians meet criteria for minor depression. SCREENING FOR MINOR DEPRESSION One of the most common instruments for screening and tracking depression in primary care is the Patient Health Questionnaire Nine-- Item Depression Module (PHQ-9). The patient fills out the questionnaire, and the information can yield a diagnosis of major or minor depression. While psychometric studies have yet to be done on the utility of the PHQ-9 with minority elders, the instrument is available in Spanish and Chinese. PSYCHOSOCIAL THERAPIES FOR MINOR DEPRESSION Empirically derived treatment guidelines have been established for major depression. However, a paucity of studies, which have yielded conflicting findings, means that no specific guidelines are currently available for pharmacologic or psychosocial treatment of minor depression. Psychosocial therapies are particularly appealing for older adults because they often have medical conditions as well, leading to an increased possibility of adverse drug interactions. Since the research on treating minor depression in older adults is so limited, we will review the evidence for psychosocial treatments of minor depression in both younger and older adults together. The interventions examined include cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal, and problem-solving therapy, as well as physical exercise. …",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by progressive dementia and memory loss, caused by the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The prevalence increases sharply with age and over time changes in the brain lead to progressive neuronal loss. AD refers to dementia that occurs gradually in adulthood and may be followed by earlier brain damage, but often has no known cause. Common symptoms of AD are problems with concentration and short-term memory, spatio-temporal disorientation, apathy and depression. The moderate / severe phase of Alzheimer's dementia is marked by a progressive decline in cognitive function, resulting in more severe functional impairment and increasing dependence on others in daily life activities. Studies in recent years have revealed specific genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of AD. This progress raised hopes for more effective treatment, but success proved unattainable, partly because many factors contribute to the\r\ndevelopment of the disease and because symptoms of the disease become apparent only after the underlying pathology has already progressed. Today’s approved drugs have little effect on dementia, especially AD, and are unable to stop disease progression. Therefore, the identification and application of non-pharmacological and preventive strategies seems to be more practical and crucial to combat this disease. The non-pharmacological approach is slowly evolving and often includes various forms of psychosocial therapy such as art therapy, music, dance and drama therapy and many others. Patients can express themselves through artistic approach using non-verbal communication and thus express their negative emotions and improve social skills, which ultimately contributes to improving cognitive abilities and reducing behavioral and psychological symptoms, and significantly improves the quality of patiens life.",

However, this syndrome may be under-recognized by both clinicians and patients (i.e., low insight, particularly among children and adolescents), and is characterized by an insidious onset, dose-dependent effects (i.e., higher selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor doses are more likely to result in symptoms), and complete resolution of symptoms with the discontinuation of the offending drug.

      "title": "Neurobiology of alcohol withdrawal: Changes inreward and stress response systems",
      "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal is a syndrome which resulted from adaptive\nchanges in the brain secondary to chronic alcohol use and is\nassociated with changes in many neurotransmitter, neuropeptide,\nand hormonal systems. Most, if not all, of the systems that involved in\nthe alcohol withdrawal are in some way related to the reward and/or\nstress system of the brain. Stressful events may increase the rewarding\neffects of the alcohol, and in turn, play an important role in the\ndevelopment of the alcohol dependence and craving, and relapses.\nConversely, chronic alcohol use leads to some impairments in the\nstress response system of the brain. CRH plays a role in the rewarding/\nenforcing effect, and at the same time, in the impacts on the\nstress system of the alcohol. In this paper, changes in the reward and\nstress response systems which are thought to be involved interrelatedly\nin the development of the alcohol withdrawal will be reviewed.",
