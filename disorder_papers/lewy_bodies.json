      "title": "Delirium",
      "abstract": "The word “delirium” is synonymous with these terms: acute confusional state, encephalopathy, toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, organic mental syndrome, organic psychosis, and toxic psychosis. Delirium is a constellation of signs and symptoms that definitively indicate the presence of an underlying physical disorder. Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

      "title": "Prodromal stage of disease (dementia) with Lewy bodies, how to diagnose in practice?",
      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

Patient's clinical features may support a specific dissociative disorder subtype diagnosis associated with sleep-related episodes, specifically dissociative identity disorder, dissociative fugue, or dissociative disorder NOS. With any form of sleep-related dissociative disorder, onset can be gradual and sporadic in nature. Females are reported to be affected predominantly, and onset can range from childhood to midlife. Sexualized and frankly sexual behaviors can emerge with sleep-related dissociative disorders. There are several potential considerations for differential diagnosis of sleep-related dissociative disorders, including an NREM arousal disorder parasomnia, parasomnia associated with REM sleep, or nocturnal seizures.",

      "abstract": "Corticobasal degeneration is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disease and a member of the 'parkinsonian' group of disorders, which also includes Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. The most common initial symptom is limb clumsiness, usually affecting one side of the body, with or without accompanying rigidity or tremor. Subsequently, the disease affects gait and there is a slow progression to influence ipsilateral arms and legs. Apraxia and dementia are the most common cortical signs. Corticobasal degeneration can be difficult to distinguish from other parkinsonian syndromes but if ocular signs and symptoms are present, they may aid clinical diagnosis. Typical ocular features include increased latency of saccadic eye movements ipsilateral to the side exhibiting apraxia, impaired smooth pursuit movements and visuo-spatial dysfunction, especially involving spatial rather than object-based tasks. Less typical features include reduction in saccadic velocity, vertical gaze palsy, visual hallucinations, sleep disturbance and an impaired electroretinogram. Aspects of primary vision such as visual acuity and colour vision are usually unaffected. Management of the condition to deal with problems of walking, movement, daily tasks and speech problems is an important aspect of the disease.",

Visual hallucinations may reflect delirium or neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Lewy body disease. This chapter focuses only on non-schizophrenic late-life psychosis. Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

      "title": "[Approach to the patient in vegetative state. Part II: differential diagnosis].",
      "abstract": "A prerequisite to the diagnosis of vegetative state is the exclusion of apparently similar syndromes, in which the patient retains the consciousness partially or even completely. Some syndromes are not separate nosological entities and should be abandoned: the apallic state, the neocortical death, the decerebrate and decorticate state, the alpha-coma, the vigil or prolonged or irreversible coma are among them. Three conditions deserve special consideration. The term locked-in syndrome describes a patient completely paralysed and mute, but fully conscious, and is usually caused by ischemic lesions of the pons. Several variants do exist, either in the causes and site of lesion. Some patients may become paralysed and mute, but conscious because of polyneuropathies, that is in the absence of any lesions of the central nervous system. The akinetic mutism is a rare condition characterised by loss of speech and nearly absent bodily movements. Painful stimulation may cause appropriate withdrawing, and wakefulness and self-awareness may be preserved, but cognitive impairment is usually present. It must be emphasised that this condition can be due to potentially treatable lesions, such as hydrocephalus and craniopharyngioma. The term \"minimally responsive\" or \"minimally conscious\" describes severely disabled patients in whom meaningful responses can be demonstrated, although inconstantly. This condition, the true diagnostic challenge, often represents a transition phase of vegetative patients recovering consciousness. Physicians, physiotherapists and patient's relatives should work all together to reach a correct diagnosis, by using current available methods to monitorize the recovery of consciousness.",

      "title": "Establishing the cause of memory loss in older people.",
      "abstract": "Common causes of memory loss in older people are mild cognitive impairment, the various types of dementia, and psychiatric illness, mainly depression. Around 10% of patients with mild cognitive impairment progress to dementia each year. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of cases. Other common types of dementia are vascular, fronto-temporal, Lewy body, Parkinson's, and mixed type dementia. There is evidence to suggest that dementia pathology is established before the onset of symptoms, and thus mild cognitive impairment can be considered as a predementia stage. NICE guidance suggests examination of: attention, concentration, short- and long-term memory, praxis, language and executive function. Particular attention should be paid to any signs of neglect, state of dress, agitation or poor attention. Dysphasia and difficulty in naming objects is often present. Mood symptoms (including suicidal ideation) may be primary or comorbid. Abnormal thoughts and perceptions should be probed for, as psychotic symptoms are common. Primary care options for cognitive testing include the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition or the Abbreviated Mental Test Score. Physical examination should include observation of gait, inspection for tremor; examination for rigidity, bradykinesia, frontal release signs, upper motor neurone lesions, pulse and BP. Structural brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy, exclude other pathologies and act as a prognostic marker of dementia progression but the overlap in structural changes between the dementias makes imaging alone insufficient for diagnostic purposes. NICE guidelines recommend referral to a memory clinic for patients with mild cognitive impairment, those at high risk of dementia, such as patients with learning disabilities, Parkinson's disease, or patients who have had several strokes.",

      "title": "PTSD, DEMENTIA, AND SLEEP DISORDER: A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: A recent article in this journal described three World War II veterans with cognitive impairment who presented with symptoms suggestive of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).1 The nature and type of dementia in these patients was not specified. Fluctuating cognition is one of the three major diagnostic criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Fluctuations are described as marked variation in a patient's cognitive or functional abilities or periods of confusion or decreased responsiveness alternating with reasonable lucidity. While identification of fluctuations is difficult, two of the reported patients had episodes of confusion and withdrawal suggestive of fluctuations. Other core features of DLB include recurrent visual hallucinations and spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism.2 The presence of any one criterion is required for a diagnosis of possible DLB, and two or more criteria are required to make a diagnosis of probable DLB. The clinical histories do not mention the presence of visual hallucinations or neuroleptic sensitivity, and the neurological examination was not reported in sufficient detail to ascertain whether these patients might have had features of parkinsonism. All three patients were diagnosed with depression before the onset of their symptoms. All also suffered from paranoid delusions. Delusions and other behavioral disturbances, while seen in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are not common presenting symptoms. Delusions are one of the supportive features of DLB. We have recently reported the validity of the proposed clinical criteria for DLB in our clinical-pathological series.3 We found that whereas delusions had high specificity (91%) in cases with mild to moderate dementia, it had low sensitivity in the diagnosis of DLB (38%). A combination of any three major or minor clinical criteria had the best predictive value (75%) in mild to moderate disease. A subjective disturbance of sleep, including the occurrence of repetitive, stereotypical anxiety dreams, is characteristic of PTSD.4-6 The phenomenology of the PTSD anxiety dream has seemed most consistent with an underlying rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dysfunction.4, 5 Whereas near total paralysis is characteristic of the REM phase of sleep, motor activity is common in the sleep disorder seen in PTSD.6 REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a recently described parasomnia characterized by excessive and elaborate motor activities during sleep and is associated with pathological absence of muscle atonia during REM sleep. The relationship between sleep disturbances in PTSD and RBD needs further research. However, the identification of RBD-like signs in PTSD, in previous cases as well as in this series, adds to the evidence for a fundamental disturbance of REM sleep mechanisms in PTSD.4-6 Other reports have described patients with RBD presenting with or subsequently developing cognitive impairment.7, 8 Most of these patients also meet criteria for possible or probable DLB. The pattern of cognitive differences from AD in these patients with RBD and dementia is similar to reported comparisons between DLB and AD. A recent international workshop on criteria for DLB has recommended including depression and RBD as additional supportive features for the diagnosis of DLB.9 The clinical features in these patients suggest a diagnosis of possible or probable DLB. The clinical descriptions do not have features typical of other common types of dementia, such as AD or vascular dementia. It is possible that in some patients PSTD and/or RBD may either herald or present with cognitive impairment, which may subsequently evolve into DLB. Further studies with longitudinal assessments will be required to address this issue. Additional investigations utilizing as polysomnography, sleep questionnaires, and detailed neuropsychological assessments may also help in this regard. The finding of a specific disturbance of sleep unique to PTSD has significant therapeutic implications and also contributes to a better understanding of the nature of the dementia associated with the cases reported.

Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The differential diagnosis of optic neuropathy is broad. Ischemic vascular forms of optic neuropathy are more common in older patients. Pain generally accompanies the visual loss in cases of inflammatory optic neuritis. Compressive or infiltrative lesions that affect the optic nerve, such as optic glioma or optic nerve sheath meningioma, may present with painless unilateral visual loss. Neoplastic and non-neoplastic causes of compression of the intracranial optic nerve and optic chiasm frequently present with visual field defects. Slowly progressive, symmetric, central visual loss suggests a possible toxic or nutritional cause. Hereditary optic neuropathies generally are classified by their mode of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or mitochondrial (maternal) inheritance. Symptoms may be confined to the visual system or be accompanied by other neurologic or systemic signs and symptoms. Optic neuropathy can also be a manifestation of inherited metabolic and degenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Does the Patient Have Abnormal Movements at Night?",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders are generally characterized by simple movements that disturb sleep or the ability to fall asleep. These disorders manifest symptoms of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness or tiredness. In order to make an accurate diagnosis, an all-night video recording is desired to differentiate these disorders from parasomnias. Sleep-related movement disorders or congenital simple movements can cause disturbed sleep. All-night recordings are recommended to differentiate the sleep-related movement disorder from parasomnias. Patients are usually unaware of movements or sleep disturbance. Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders are repetitive and stereotyped with rhythmic motor behaviors. These movements occur during drowsiness or early sleep and involve large muscle groups and include body rocking, head rolling, or head banging. They are more common in children and infants. In most situations, they do not have any significant consequences. Many sleep-related movement disorders are a result of a medical condition due to side effects or withdrawal from medication or a substance, or they could be an isolated symptom or normal variant. Many of these disorders of movement tend to overlap with other sleep conditions including parasomnias. In general, parasomnias are undesirable physical events that occur when falling asleep, during sleep, or while waking up. They include abnormal sleep-related complex movements, behaviors, and autonomic nervous system activity. They significantly contrast with sleep-related movement disorders. Parasomnias tend to result in injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Sometimes they affect the patient, the bed partner, or both. Non-REM-related parasomnias include confused arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Patients tend to have a partial or complete amnesia for episodes. REM-related parasomnias include a REM behavior disorder also known as RBD. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged to elderly males. However, it is often associated with an underlying neurologic disorder such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, narcolepsy, cerebrovascular accident, or Lewy body dementia. Nightmare disorder is apparent during rapid eye movement sleep and often leads to awakening with a bowel movement. While prevalent in the general population, this is common in children. Nightmares are frequently associated with psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder. The patient remembers the dreams and can describe the nightmare, which usually involves threats to survival, security, or physical activity. Nightmares can have a negative impact on family functioning and lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or low energy. It can also impair occupational or educational functions.",

      "abstract": "The Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second or the third most frequent degenerative dementia. Pathological characteristics of LBD are the Lewy bodies (LB), intracytoplasmatic inclusions that react immunohistochemically with anti-ubiquitin and anti-alpha-synuclein antibodies. Hereditary forms of LBD are also described. The basic clinical characteristics of LBD are progressive dementia, akinetic-rigid Parkinsonism, repeated visual hallucinations and fluctuations of the state of consciousness and cognition. Repeated falls and syncopes may occur as well, together with hypersensitivity to neuroleptics systematic delusional ideas, hallucinations of the other senses, depression behavioral disturbance of REM sleep, vegetative signs, and, though rarely other manifestations. Dominant feature on the biochemical level is the deficit of cortical cholinergic innervation. LBD has a progressive course, more rapid than Alzheimer`s disease, and faster mortality. The disease lasts 1 to 20 years, the mean length being 6 years. Neuropsychological finding corresponds to the combination of cortical and subcortical dementia, with marked disturbances of attention, visuo-spatial functions, working and semantic memory and executive functions. Differential diagnosis includes other dementias, primarily the Alzheimer’s disease and extrapyramidal diseases. In the treatment of LBD cholinesterase inhibitors are mostly used. It is necessary to avoid administration of neuroleptics as long as possible, since they can accelerate the course of the disease or even cause death. A case is also presented, of a patient with typical LBD that lasted 5 years, with all the clinical manifestations meeting the consensus guidelines for setting the diagnosis of LBD.",

REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with the later development of one of the synucleopathies, which include: Parkinson-s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy, but not with Alzheimer-s disease. Declining cognitive functioning results in increasing difficulties with occupational and social skills and activities of daily living. A parkinsonian movement disorder characterized by rigidity, slowed movements, the diminution of small motor movements that comprise the natural fluidity of body motion, stooped posture, and a shuffling gait may be seen in dementia with Lewy bodies. It is easier to differentiate dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer-s disease and other dementias early on in the course of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Inherited metabolic disorders can cause onset of epilepsy in the first year of life. Epilepsy rarely dominates the clinical presentation, which is more frequently associated with other neurologic symptoms, such as mental retardation, hypotonia and/or dystonia, or vigilance disturbances. The pathogenesis of seizures is multifaceted; inherited metabolic disorder can affect the balance between excitatory and inhibitory chemical mediators, eliminate an energetic substrate at the cerebral level, cause in utero brain malformation, or provoke acute brain lesions. Some clinical disorders that strongly suggest particular metabolic etiologies can be identified. For example, specific clinical signs and findings on electroencephalogram (EEG) are characteristic of pyridoxine-dependent seizures, and inherited metabolic disorders associated with early myoclonic encephalopathy are well defined. In most cases, however, epilepsy secondary to inherited metabolic disorders presents with polymorphic clinical and EEG features that are difficult to classify into precise epileptic syndromes. Common characteristics of these seizures include onset in the first months of life; usually partial, multifocal; simple partial motor semiology; successive appearance of tonic seizures, spasms, and massive myoclonus; and resistance to antiepilepsy drugs. Inherited metabolic disorders must be considered in patients presenting with epilepsy and progressive neurologic worsening.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common motor movement disorder and second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease (AD), is often preceded by a period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is associated with impairment of a variety of cognitive domains including executive function, attention, visuospatial abilities and memory. MCI, a risk factor for developing dementia, affects around 30% of de novo PD patients and can increase to 75% after more than 10 years. While 30–40% remain in the MCI state, up to 60% will convert to dementia. Characteristic findings are slowing of EEG rhythms, frontotemporal hypoperfusion, decreased functional connectivity in the default mode and attentional networks, prefrontal and basal-ganglia-cortical circuits, which often manifests prior to clinical symptoms and overt brain atrophy. The heterogeneity of cognitive phenotypes suggests that a common neurodegenerative process affects multiple functional neuronal networks and neuromodulatory systems that may be superimposed by Lewy body and Alzheimer's-related or other co-pathologies. Sparse neuropathological data for PD-MCI revealed a heterogenous picture with various morphological changes similar to MCI in other diseases. This review highlights the essential epidemiological, clinical, neuroimaging and morphological changes in PD-MCI, available biomarkers, and discusses the heterogenous pathobiological mechanisms involved in its development. In view of its complex pathogenesis, well-designed longitudinal clinico-pathological studies are warranted to clarify the alterations leading to MCI in PD, which may be supported by fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers as a basis for early diagnosis and future adequate treatment modalities of this debilitating disorder.",

The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age.

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review In the central nervous system there are many regulatory processes controlling the lower urinary tract. This review considers the possibility that urinary dysfunction may precede diagnosis of neurological disease. Recent findings Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) occur early in multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and normal pressure hydrocephalus, and may present before neurological diagnosis. Some people present with LUTS and subsequently are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or a spinal condition. In male LUTS, the symptoms could reflect early stages of a neurological disease, which has not yet been diagnosed (‘occult neurology’). Key symptoms include erectile dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation, enuresis, loss of filling sensation or unexplained stress urinary incontinence. Directed questioning should enquire about visual symptoms, back pain, anosmia, bowel dysfunction and incontinence, or memory loss. Examination features can include resting tremor, ‘croaky’ speech, abnormal gait, orthostatic hypotension, ataxia, or altered perineal sensation. Imaging, such as MRI scan, should only be requested after expert neurological examination, to ensure the correct parts of the central nervous system are scanned with appropriate radiological protocols. Summary Urologists should consider an undiagnosed neurological condition can be present in a few cases. Any finding should be further evaluated by colleagues with relevant expertise.",

      "abstract": "A brainstem syndrome is recognizable in patients presenting with a combination of visual disturbances, incoordination, gait problems, speech and swallowing difficulties, and new-onset sleep symptomatology. Brainstem disorders of subacute onset (onset and progression with accumulation of disabling deficits in 6–12 weeks) are generally of autoimmune, infectious, inflammatory, or infiltrative neoplastic cause. An autoimmune or infectious brainstem disorder may be referred to as brainstem encephalitis or rhombencephalitis. We describe a patient with paraneoplastic autoimmune rhombencephalitis, in whom diagnostic clues included the following: diverse visual and sleep symptoms, trismus, and choking in the history; see-saw nystagmus, opsoclonus, dysarthria, jaw dystonia, and episodic laryngospasm on examination; subtle but longitudinal and nonenhancing T2 MRI abnormalities in the brainstem and upper cervical cord; and oligoclonal bands in the CSF. His movement disorder–specific neural IgG profile revealed ANNA-2 (anti-Ri) and KLHL-11-IgG. Both are biomarkers of paraneoplastic brainstem encephalitis. KLCHL-11-IgG has been reported to accompany germ cell tumors, which was found in a solitary metastasis to the left inguinal lymph node in our patient, along with an atrophic left testis. Multidisciplinary treatment (autoimmune neurology, sleep medicine, ophthalmology, and physiatry) led to significant clinical improvements. This case provides a framework for the evaluation of patients with subacute-onset brainstem syndromes and the investigation and management of those with paraneoplastic and other autoimmune diseases.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Differential diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia remains a challenge for neurologists and psychiatrists as some behavioural symptoms of this illness and psychiatric disorders, such as apathy, are not specific. Aim: The paper aims at presenting the differential diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and primary psychiatric disorders. Discussion: Behavioural symptoms of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia overlap with symptoms typical for primary psychiatric disorders. Psychotic symptoms, apathy and inappropriate behaviour are prominent in schizophrenia. Repetitive behaviours are typical for obsessive-compulsive disorders. Inattention and impulsivity are common in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Disinhibition is typical of mania in the context of bipolar disorder. Thus, all these psychiatric diagnoses need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. This condition is associated with language deficits and more widespread executive and social cognition deficits. Also, the presence of neurological symptoms, such as oculomotor dysfunction, upper/lower motor neuron dysfunction or bradykinesia, may facilitate the diagnosis. Functional decline is observed during follow-up in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, but not in phenocopy syndrome. Conclusions: Differential diagnosis requires integration of behavioural and neuropsychological data with the results of neurological assessment and neuroimaging work-up. In ambiguous cases, if genetic testing is negative, only longitudinal observation can confirm the diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia or phenocopy syndrome.",

      "title": "Degenerative Central Nervous System (CNS) Disease",
      "abstract": "The hallmark of degenerative disorders of the CNS is the progressive loss of previously acquired abilities. In infants and young children, a deceleration in the rate of development is often the first presentation: the child falls progressively behind other children and only subsequently loses previously acquired milestones. When the declining developmental quotient is not due to an extrinsic agent or event or to secondary involvement of the CNS by a generalized systemic disease, neurodegenerative disease becomes a consideration.The acquisition of new developmental milestones does not exclude the existence of a degenerative disorder. In healthy infants, strides in development occur sporadically, with a child often appearing to have reached a plateau for several weeks. Initially, it may be only the prolongation of one of these plateaus that leads to suspicion of a progressive neurodegenerative diseaseMost degenerative CNS disorders can be divided clinically into three groups: gray-matter diseases, white-matter diseases, and system diseases. The gray-matter diseases, which primarily involve the neurons, occur with or without histologic evidence of storage of abnormal metabolic products. They lead to neuronal death and secondary degeneration of axons. In the white-matter diseases, myelin is disrupted, either by the destruction of normal myelin or by the production of biochemically abnormal myelin. The system diseases are a heterogeneous group of conditions involving progressive degeneration of anatomically defined systems, such as the dorsal columns,pyramidal tracts, or cerebellar nuclei. Typically, both neurons and myelin are destroyed in these disorders.The first clinical task in evaluating a child for any neurodegenerative disorder is to document that he or she has lost previously acquired milestones or has a decelerating developmental quotient. In either instance, the most important diagnostic tool is repeated developmental evaluations.The major clinical features that differentiate gray-matter from white-matter diseases are related directly to the functional roles of the neurons and myelin. Neuronal involvement in gray-matter disease leads to the early onset of dementia, the progressive loss of cognitive abilities, and seizures that frequently are myoclonic. The basal ganglia and cerebellar nuclei are collections of neurons, so extrapyramidal and cerebellar signs, such as ataxia, are common. Ganglion cells of the retina are affected in many of the gray-matter disorders, producing pigmentary degeneration of the retina. Abnormal storage of lipid in retinal ganglion cells (eg, in Tay-Sachs disease) makes the perifoveal area look gray and opaque. The fovea, which contains no ganglion cells,appears red by contrast, producing the clinically detected \"cherry red spot.\"The majority of degenerative diseases of white matter stem from biochemical defects resulting in abnormal myelin that breaks down rapidly. These\"dysmyelinating\" disorders are called leukodystrophies. Clinically, the earliest sign of most white-matter degenerations is spasticity. Dementia and seizures can occur, but usually later in the clinical course. Extrapyramidal signs are rare, but involvement of cerebellar pathways can cause ataxia. Rather than the cherry-red spot of gray-matter disease,optic atrophy is the most characteristic ocular change seen in white-matter disease. Some patients even have cortical blindness from demyelination of the optic pathways in the cerebral hemispheres.Each of the so-called system diseases has its own signs and symptoms,depending on the particular neural pathways involved. One such disease is Rett syndrome (RS), which is characterized by a period of normal development followed by the loss of developmental milestones and the onset of stereotypic hand movements akin to those seen with autism, followed by seizures and dementia. RS affects girls, probably exclusively, and occurs worldwide. Although most cases are sporadic, the disease has long been suspected of having a genetic basis. Recent genetic advances suggest that the gene for RS is located on the distal arm of the X chromosome.Clinical criteria alone can point to a diagnosis of RS. Usually the antenatal and birth histories are normal, but most girls affected with RS pass through four predictable stages:Stage 1 (birth to ∼18 mo):Deceleration of head growth, beginning between 2 and 4 months of age, results in an acquired microcephaly. This insidious failure of brain growth can be missed if head circumference is not meticulously measured and plotted at health supervision visits. Early in the disease, babies show decreased interest in their environment and become markedly hypotonic.Stage 2 (∼1 to 2 y): The loss of both expressive language and gross motor milestones, and the onset of abnormal hand movements, seizures, irritability,and insomnia are typical of progressing RS.Stage 3 (2 to 10 y): Severe mental retardation, seizures, and persistent stereotypic hand wringing movements characterize the childhood phase of RS. Most patients develop ataxic and wide-based gaits, but many affected girls never walk. Tremulousness is a common finding, as are breath-holding spells. Many children who have RS are misdiagnosed as having Angelman syndrome or ataxic cerebral palsy.Stage 4 (older than 10 y): As girls who have RS approach adolescence,they develop progressive scoliosis,muscle wasting, and can become wheelchair-bound. By the early teenage years, they reach a plateau in their neurologic regression, but death usually occurs during late adolescence from infection or cardiac arrhythmia.Many disorders that have different etiologies may resemble neurodegenerative diseases in clinical presentation:hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, mass and structural lesions of the brain,chromosomal defects, poorly controlled seizures, environmental deprivation,subdural hematomas, and congenital and chronic infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus. Neurodegenerative disorders, unlike these others,are predominantly hereditary. Although the biochemical basis of many neurodegenerative disorders is not fully understood, a precise biochemical diagnosis always should be sought to make possible an accurate discussion of prognosis, to provide counseling, and sometimes to administer specific treatment.Over the past decade, the availability of molecular genetic testing has improved the accuracy of diagnosis in symptomatic patients, prenatally when genetic risk has been identified, and for carrier testing. Many neurodegenerative disorders can be diagnosed by biochemical testing of blood or urine without invasive procedures to obtain tissue for direct examination. Even so, a diagnosis of an altered enzyme disease should be confirmed histologically.In general, treatment is available for only a few of the neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, most remain invariably fatal by late childhood. Dietary therapy, restriction of a substrate or substrate precursor, modification of enzyme activity with cofactor vitamin therapy, and enzyme replacement all have been attempted with only limited success. Hope for more effective treatment comes from developments in molecular genetics that may allow the repair of specific point mutations in the human genome.In 1966, Rett described a syndrome of cerebral atrophy and hyperammonemia that appeared to affect girls exclusively. Experience has shown that elevated ammonia levels are an exception rather than the rule, and no other laboratory or imaging test provides diagnostic confirmation. Once again, we are thrown back on our clinical skills. Girls who have RS develop normally through the first few months of life, until their brains begin to atrophy, leading to acquired microcephaly. They progress to gait apraxia and truncal ataxia, autistic-like behavior, loss of cognitive function, rather typical\"hand-washing\" movements, seizures,and pyramidal tract signs. The dementia is devastating.We usually think of X-linked disorders, which RS appears to be, as primarily affecting boys: factor VIII deficiency,glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Whereas these disorders are recessive, RS may well be inherited dominantly and be lethal to boys because they have only one X chromosome. Hopefully,as Dr Rich remarks, advances in our understanding of the molecular genetics of neurodegenerative disorders like RS will lead to effective treatment.",

      "title": "A - 110 Characterization of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Multiple System Atrophy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that primarily impacts movement and balance, as well as the autonomic nervous system. While traditionally not associated with cognitive decline, recent evidence indicates cognitive impairment is part of the disease process, typically manifesting as attentional and executive function deficits, alongside learning/memory impairments. This case contributes to MSA literature by describing mild cognitive changes in a patient with predominant autonomic dysfunction. Method A 68-year-old Caucasian man exhibited progressive cognitive changes over 2–3 years, with concerns emerging 5–10 years prior to neurological consultation (e.g., forgetfulness, word-finding difficulties, decline in ability to follow complex instructions). Predominant sensorimotor/physiological changes included chronic constipation, vasovagal episodes, hearing loss, orthostatic hypotension, transient vision loss, and mild dysphagia. Neuroimaging showed nonspecific mild pontine T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. Significant family history of dementia. Results Evaluation showed mostly normal cognitive function with some decline in executive functioning (slowed processing, reduced problem-solving, set loss, task rigidity) and mild memory decline. Despite scores within normal limits, performance likely reflects cognitive change consistent with his subjective experience, possibly masked by strong cognitive reserve (high educational and occupational attainment, research interests, social engagement). Conclusions Although lacking frank impairment, the patient’s history suggests a neurological process (i.e., synucleinopathy such as MSA) including history of REM sleep behavior disorder, autonomic symptoms/conditions, and neuroimaging findings suggestive of brain stem involvement. Neuropsychological evaluation is critical in differentiating MSA from other Parkinsons’s plus syndromes, as it typically presents with fewer cognitive impairments.",

      "title": "Acquired Aphasia, Dementia, and Behavior Disorder with Epilepsy and Continuous Spike and Waves During Sleep in a Child",
      "abstract": "Summary: Severe persistent neuropsychological disorders sometimes develop in the course of a focal epilepsy of unknown origin in previously normal children. Very frequent bilateral focal or generalized discharges are often noted on the sleep EEG records of these patients with no evidence of clinical seizures. The relation between these paroxysms and the observed deterioration remains unclear. We report a child with a partial complex epilepsy and severe disturbances of language, cognition, and behavior acquired in the early years of development who was followed for 15 years. A correlation between the evolution of the striking EEG abnormalities during sleep and the neuropsychological disorders could be established retrospectively. The observed sequence of onset and recovery of the aphasia, the dementia, and the “psychotic” behavior makes a direct causal relation between these deficits quite unlikely. Rather it suggests an association of independent symptoms with a specific language disorder becoming manifest in the course of the evolution. This child shows many of the main characteristics of the syndromes of “acquired aphasia with convulsive disorder” (Landau‐Kleffner syndrome) and “epilepsy with continuous spike and waves during sleep.” Both syndromes describe probably different facets of a similar underlying, still unexplained cerebral dysfunction. RÉSUMÉ Des troubles neuropsychologiques séverès et persistants peuvent survenir au cours ďune épilepsie focale ďétiologie inconnue chez des enfants auparavant normaux. Chez ces patients, on trouve souvent de très nombreuses décharges focales bilatéiales ou généralisées àľEEG de sommeil, sans crise clinique. La relation entre ces paroxysmes et la détérioration observée reste peu claire. Nous rapportons en détail le cas ďun enfant présentant une épilepsie partielle complexe et des troubles séverès du langage, des fonctions cognitives et du comportement acquis précocément au cours du développement, que nous avons suivi durant 15 ans. Une correlation entre ľévolution des anomalies EEG bilatérales durant le sommeil et des déficits neuropsychologiques a pûêtre établie rétrospectivement. Le mode de survenue et de récupération de ľaphasie, de la démence et du comportement “psychotique” rendent peu probable une relation causale entre ces déficits. II suggère plutôt une association de symptômes indepéndants avec un trouble spécifique du langage devenu prédominant au cours de ľévolution. Cet enfant présente la plupart des caractéristiques principales des syndromes ď“aphasie acquise avec épilepsie” et ď“épilepsie avec pointes‐ondes continues du sommeil.” Ces deux syndromes décrivent probablement des facettes différentes ďune même dysfonction cérébrale sous‐jacente dont la nature reste inexpliquée. RESUMEN En ocasiones, trastornos neuropsicológicos severos y persistentes surgen en el curso de una epilepsía focal de causa desconocida, en niños previamente normales. En estos pacientes, sin ataques clínicos, muy frecuentemente se registran descargas focales generalizadas que aparecen en los EEGs registrados durante el sueño. La relación entre estos paroxismos y el deterioro clínico permanece oscura. Se presenta un caso de un niño con epilepsía parcial compleja y severa alteración cognitiva, del lenguaje y del comportamiento que aparecieron en los años iniciales del desarrollo. Este nino ha sido seguido durante 15 afios. De modo retrospectivo fue posible establecer una correlación entra la evolución de las llamativas anomalías del EEG durante el sueño y los trastornos neuropsicológicos. La secuen‐ciaobservada entre el comienzo y la recuperación de la afasia, la dementia y el comportamiento “psicótico”, hace que una relción directa causal entre estos problemas sea muy improbable. Más bien sugiere una asociacíon de síntomas independientes con un trastorno específico del lenguaje que aparece en primer piano en el curso de la evolución. Este niño mostró muchas de las características principales de los síndromes “afasia adquirida con trastornos convulsivos (síndrome de Landau‐Kleffner)” y “epilepsía con continuas complejos punta‐onda durante el sueño”. Ambos síndromes probablemente describen diferentes facetas de una disfunción cerebral subyacente todavía inexplicada. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Gelegentlich entwickeln sich bei vormals normalen Kindern im Verlauf einer fokalen Epilepsie unklarer Ätiologie schwere persistierende neuropsychologische Störungen. Bei solchen Patienten werden häufig zahlreiche bilateral fokale oder generalisierte Entladungen im Schlaf‐EEG ohne klinische Anfälle gefunden. Die Beziehung zwischen den Paroxysmen und der beobachteten mentalen Verschlechterung bleibt unklar, Wir berichten über ein Kind mit einer partiell komplexen Epilepsie und schweren Störungen der Sprache, der kognitiven Fähigkeiten und des Verhaltens, die in frühen Jahren erworben wurden. Das Kind wurde über 15 Jahre lang weiter verfolgt. Rückblickend kann eine Korrelation zwischen der Entwicklung den EEG‐Auffälligkeiten wahrend des Schlafs und den neuropsychologischen Störungen hergestellt werden. Die beobachtete Folge im Auftreten und Wiederrückbildung der Aphasie, der Demenz und der “psychotischen” Verhaltensstörungen macht eine direkte kausale Beziehung zwischen diesen Defiziten unwahrscheinlich. Sie legt vielmehr eine Assoziation unabhängiger Symptome mit einer spezifischen Sprachstörung nahe, die im Laufe der Entwicklung in den Vordergrund tritt. Das Kind zeigt viele der Hauptcharakteristika des Syndroms der “erworbenen Aphasie mit Anfallserkrankung” (Landau‐Kleffner‐Syndrom) und der “Epilepsie mit kontinuierlichen Spike Wave Entladungen während des Schlafs”. Beide Syndrome beschreiben wahrscheinlich verschiedene Facetten einer ähnlichen bis jetzt ungeklärten zerebralen Stöning.",

      "title": "Nystagmus: Diagnosis, Topographic Anatomical Localization and Therapy",
      "abstract": "Nystagmus is defined as rhythmic, most often involuntary eye movements. It normally consists of a slow (pathological) drift of the eyes, followed by a fast central compensatory movement back to the primary position (refixation saccade). The direction, however, is reported according to the fast phase. The cardinal symptoms are, on the one hand, blurred vision, jumping images (oscillopsia), reduced visual acuity and, sometimes, double vision; many of these symptoms depend on the eye position. On the other hand, depending on the etiology, patients may suffer from the following symptoms: 1. permanent dizziness, postural imbalance, and gait disorder (typical of downbeat and upbeat nystagmus); 2. if the onset of symptoms is acute, the patient may experience spinning vertigo with a tendency to fall to one side (due to ischemia in the area of the brainstem or cerebellum with central fixation nystagmus or as acute unilateral vestibulopathy with spontaneous peripheral vestibular nystagmus); or 3. positional vertigo. There are two major categories: the first is spontaneous nystagmus, i.e., nystagmus which occurs in the primary position as upbeat or downbeat nystagmus; and the second includes various types of nystagmus which are induced or modified by certain factors. Examples are gaze-evoked nystagmus, head-shaking nystagmus, positional nystagmus, and hyperventilation-induced nystagmus. In addition, there are disorders similar to nystagmus, such as ocular flutter or opsoclonus. The most common central types of spontaneous nystagmus are downbeat and upbeat, infantile, pure torsional, pendular fixation, periodic alternating, and seesaw nystagmus. Many types of nystagmus allow a precise neuroanatomical localization: for instance, downbeat nystagmus, which is most often caused by a bilateral floccular lesion or dysfunction, or upbeat nystagmus, which is caused by a lesion in the midbrain or medulla. Examples of drug treatment are the use of 4-aminopyridine for downbeat and upbeat nystagmus, memantine or gabapentin for pendular fixation nystagmus, or baclofen for periodic alternating nystagmus. In this article we are focusing on nystagmus. In a second article we will focus on central ocular motor disorders, such as saccade or gaze palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and gaze-holding deficits. Therefore, these types of eye movements will not be described here in detail.Unter einem Nystagmus versteht man rhythmische Augenbewegungen, die i. d. R. aus einer langsamen (ursächlichen bzw. pathologischen) Augendrift und einer schnellen kompensatorischen Rückstellbewegung (Rückstellsakkade) bestehen; die Richtung wird klinisch nach der schnellen Phase angegeben. Leitsymptome sind zum einen Verschwommensehen, „hüpfende oder laufende Bilder“ (Oszillopsien), verminderte Sehschärfe sowie manchmal Doppelbilder, die oft blickpositionsabhängig sind. Zum anderen können die Patienten, je nach Ursache, leiden unter 1. permanentem Schwankschwindel und Gangunsicherheit (wie beim Downbeat- [DBN] oder Upbeat-Nystagmus [UBN]), 2. Drehschwindel mit gerichteter Fallneigung (bei akutem Beginn) sowie 3. Lagerungsschwindel. Es lassen sich im Wesentlichen zwei Kategorien unterscheiden: 1. Spontannystagmus, d. h. ein Nystagmus, der in Geradeausblickposition auftritt, wie DBN oder UBN, und 2. verschiedene Nystagmusformen, die durch bestimmte Faktoren ausgelöst oder moduliert werden, wie Blickrichtungs-, Kopfschüttel-, Rebound-, Lagerungs-, hyperventilations- oder druckinduzierter Nystagmus. Daneben gibt es noch nystagmusähnliche schnelle Augenbewegungen wie Ocular Flutter oder Opsoklonus. Die häufigsten zentralen Formen eines Spontannystagmus sind DBN, UBN, infantiler Nystagmus, seltener sind Fixationspendelnystagmus, rein torsioneller, periodisch alternierender und See-saw-Nystagmus. Viele Nystagmusformen erlauben eine genaue anatomische Lokalisation, wie z. B. der DBN, der meistens auf einer beidseitigen zerebellären Flocculusläsion beruht oder der UBN auf einer Läsion im Mesenzephalon oder der Medulla oblongata. Beispiele einer Pharmakotherapie sind die Gabe von 4-Aminopyridin beim DBN und UBN, Memantin oder Gabapentin beim Fixationspendelnystagmus oder Baclofen beim periodisch alternierenden Nystagmus. Abschließend: in einem nachfolgenden Artikel werden in dieser Zeitschrift die häufigsten und klinisch relevanten zentralen Okulomotorikstörungen wie Sakkaden und Blickparesen, internukleäre Ophthalmoplegie oder Blickhaltedefekte dargestellt, sodass auf diese hier nicht detailliert eingegangen wird.",

      "title": "Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (FTNCD) represents a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that compromise function of frontal brain networks, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits (see Box 65- ). More often referred to as frontotemporal dementia in the medical literature, FTNCD is a common cause of dementia among patients ages 45–65 years and comprises two sometimes overlapping clinical syndromes: behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD) (Table 3- ). The latter syndrome includes two subtypes: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. Either (1) or (2): Behavioral variant: Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: Behavioral disinhibition. Apathy or inertia. Loss of sympathy or empathy. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior. Hyperorality and dietary changes. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities. Language variant: Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production, word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise, possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed: Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroimaging. Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.83 (G31.84). ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) FTNCD involves a variety of largely nonoverlapping neuropathological patterns that are distinct from those observed among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathological subtypes include diseases that are characterized by aggregation of one of three proteins in affected frontal or temporal areas of the cerebral cortex: tau, transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), and fused-in-sarcoma (FUS). Other less common pathologies have been described. Clinical symptomatology may provide clues about the underlying FTLD subtype, but there are no strict associations between Bv-FTNCD or Lv-FTNCD and a particular histopathology. Clinical features of behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD), including progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD) Subtype Symptoms Cognitive profile Neuroimaging Motor findings Neuropathology Bv-FTNCD Behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, repetitive or stereotyped motor behaviors, and hyperorality Deficits in attention, working memory, set shifting, mental flexibility, response inhibition, and abstract reasoning, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Right hemispheric frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy, particularly involving the orbitofrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices Motor neuron disease in 10%–15%; Parkinsonian findings or supranuclear gaze disturbance in others FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS, and others Lv-FTNCD (PNFA) Slow, effortful, and telegraphic speech; dysarthria; agrammatisms; and occasional asymmetric right foot and hand motor impairment Agrammatical speech, decreased phonemic fluency, and apraxia of speech, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Left frontoinsular and perisylvian atrophy Asymmetric Parkinsonian signs, apraxia, focal dystonia, myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon, supranuclear gaze disturbance, axial rigidity, and postural instability FTLD-tau in most cases Lv-FTNCD (SD) Decreased object naming and single word comprehension Impaired naming, surface dyslexia, and prosopagnosia, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Asymmetric anterior and lateral temporal atrophy, usually left more than right Less common than in other FTNCD subtypes FTLD-TDP in most cases Note. FTLD = frontotemporal lobar degeneration; FUS = fused-in-sarcoma; TDP = transactive response DNA-binding protein. There are two general approaches to treatment of FTNCD: disease modification and symptomatic management. Disease-modifying therapies target pathogenic molecules and thereby alter, slow, or arrest the disease process. Unfortunately, no disease-modifying therapies are available for persons with FTNCD at this time. Symptomatic management attempts to control disease manifestations alone, and it is the only approach to FTNCD currently available.",

The severity of impairment and the variety of symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders or with particular epilepsy syndromes reflect focal or global, structural or functional dysfunction of neuronal networks. The complex relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy is secondary to common factors that include genetics, cognition, motor and language function. The epileptic encephalopathies are associated with regression or slowing of cognitive, language or behavior and the accepted working hypothesis is that this is a direct consequence of the seizures or of the interictal epileptiform activity, as opposed to the associated medical condition. The evidence that recurrent seizures or abnormal electrical activity can cause specific cognitive, language or behavioral abnormalities even in accepted epileptic encephalopathies is still controversial. Data from animal studies and the clinical experience from epileptic encephalopathies of early life imply that there are developmental time windows crucial to the type of epilepsy syndrome and to cognitive and behavioral outcome.The management of children in whom a neurodevelopmental disorder coexists with epilepsy is a difficult problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the epilepsy and the specific cognitive or behavioral problem and is tailored to the needs of the individual child.",

There was no correlation between the various diurnal symptoms and the presence of uninhibited bladder contractions. Enuresis was associated with obstructive uropathy in only 6 percent of cases. Some evidence has also been presented to support the concepts of ectopic sensory receptors and abnormal sphincter inhibition. A review of the problem of pathogenesis has suggested four main areas of possible abnormality: 1. A sensory lesion producing inadequate or delayed appreciation of bladder activity. 2. Cortical and subcortical dysfunction because of inadequate arousal or defective maturation of subconscious inhibition. 3. A congenital or acquired upper motor neurone lesion causing an uninhibited bladder. 4. A similar or related lesion causing an over-inhibited sphincter. These factors probably always occur in varying combinations. Because of the lack of association between symptoms, signs and objective measurements, there is a strong case for relating diagnosis, prognosis and treatment to urodynamic assessment.",

A wide variety of neurological complications are characteristic features of Sjogren's syndrome, of which peripheral neuropathy is a major neurological manifestation. Based on the predominant neuropathic symptoms, patients can be considered to have several forms of neuropathies, including sensory ataxic neuropathy, painful sensory neuropathy without sensory ataxia, multiple mononeuropathy, multiple cranial neuropathy, trigeminal neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and radiculoneuropathy. Acute or subacute onset is observed more frequently in multiple mononeuropathy and multiple cranial neuropathies, whereas disease progression is usually chronic in other forms of neuropathies. Sensory symptoms without substantial motor involvement are observed predominantly in sensory ataxic, painful sensory, trigeminal, and autonomic neuropathies. In contrast, motor impairment is apparent in multiple mononeuropathy, multiple cranial neuropathy, and radiculoneuropathy. Autonomic symptoms such as abnormal pupils and orthostatic hypotension are particularly noted in patients with sensory ataxic, painful, trigeminal, and autonomic neuropathies. Sural nerve biopsy specimens reveal predominantly large fiber loss in sensory ataxic neuropathy and predominantly small fiber loss in painful sensory neuropathy. Vasculitis is observed most frequently in multiple mononeuropathy. The autopsy findings of patients with sensory ataxic and painful neuropathies demonstrate neuronal loss in the dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic ganglia with CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Differential therapeutic responses to corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin can be seen among the various neuropathic forms. In conclusion, the clinicopathological features of neuropathies associated with Sjogren's syndrome are highly variable. The neuropathy classification is important from a therapeutic point of view.",

There is insufficient evidence to support universal screening for cognitive impairment in older adults; however, clinicians should be alert to patient and caregiver concerns about cognitive changes and investigate such concerns with validated cognitive assessment tools. Alzheimer disease is the leading cause and prototypical form of dementia, presenting insidiously and causing progressive cognitive impairment with increasing severity over a period of years. Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia and often co-occurs with other progressive cognitive disorders. Lewy body dementias encompass Parkinson disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, which have similar features and are differentiated primarily by the order of motor and cognitive symptom onset.

Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

Some patients may show rapid symptoms progression. Objective: To evaluate clinical and neuropathological features of patients with a rapidly progressive diffuse Lewy Body disease. Methods: Review clinical records and pathological findings of 6 cases with diffuse Lewy Body disease and rapid disease progression (less than 18 months before death). Results: Mean age at disease onset was 72.5 years, and mean disease duration was 9 months. Onset consisted of delirium in 3 patients and rapidly progressive dementia in the other three. All cases presented visual hallucinations and delusions; cognitive symptoms were fluctuating in two, parkinsonism occurred in four, and myoclonus in three. Brain MRI did not show cortical or basal ganglia hyperintensities. Periodic sharp waves were absent on EEG. 14.3.3 protein in CSF was negative. Myocardial 123 I‐metaiodo‐benzyl‐guanidine SPECT showed marked reduction in tracer uptake in the 2 patients tested. Neuropathological studies did not identify any particular feature that could differentiate rapidly progressive diffuse Lewy body disease from classical diffuse Lewy body disease. Conclusions: Diffuse Lewy body disease is a possible cause of rapidly progressive dementia and should be included in the differential diagnosis of confusional states of undetermined cause. In patients with rapidly progressive dementia, the presence of fluctuating cognition, parkinsonism, hallucinations, delusions, or severe dysautonomia, should raise the suspicion of diffuse Lewy body disease. Neuroimaging studies such as 123 I‐metaiodo‐benzyl‐guanidine myocardial scintigraphy may support the clinical diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics RERE-related disorders are characterized by neurodevelopmental problems with or without structural anomalies of the eyes, heart, kidneys, and genitourinary tract and mild sensorineural hearing loss. Hypotonia and feeding problems are common among affected individuals. Developmental delay and intellectual disability range from mild to profound. Behavior problems may include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, self-injurious behavior, and autism spectrum disorder. A variety of eye anomalies (coloboma, optic nerve anomalies, microphthalmia, and/or Peter's anomaly) and vision issues (myopia, anisometropia, astigmatism, exotropia, esotropia) have been reported. Congenital heart defects, most commonly septal defects, have also been described. Genitourinary abnormalities include vesicoureteral reflux, and cryptorchidism and hypospadias in males. Sensorineural hearing loss can be unilateral or bilateral. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of RERE-related disorders is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RERE by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Feeding difficulties may require the use of feeding therapy and/or thickened liquids; in severe cases, a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube may be considered. Seizure disorders, abnormal vision and/or strabismus, hearing loss, congenital heart defects, gastroesophageal reflux, genitourinary anomalies, scoliosis, congenital hip dysplasia, developmental delay, and behavioral problems are treated in the standard manner. Surveillance: At least annual monitoring of developmental progress / educational needs and for scoliosis (until growth is complete). Annual (or as clinically indicated) ophthalmologic and audiologic evaluations. Routine follow up with a cardiologist and a urologist, as indicated for those who have anomalies involving these organ systems. Monitoring of seizure activity and behavioral issues as needed. Genetic counseling RERE-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and are typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. If the RERE pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in one of the parents, the risk to sibs is low (~1%) but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism for the pathogenic variant. Once the RERE pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "abstract": "Myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE) belongs to the group of epilepsies with primarily generalized seizures as absence epilepsies, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, as well as infantile and juvenile idiopathic epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population and are associated with adverse effects such as motor vehicle collisions, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized into three groups: people with problems falling asleep, people with behavior and movement disturbances during sleep, and people with excessive daytime sleepiness. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is defined by difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or both, resulting in daytime consequences. Insomnia is diagnosed by history and is treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without medications. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in patients acting out their dreams with potentially harmful effects. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is diagnosed by polysomnography and treated with melatonin or clonazepam. Restless legs syndrome is defined by an urge to move the legs that worsens when at rest. Restless legs syndrome is treated with gabapentin or dopamine agonists, depending on the severity. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep hallucinations. Diagnosis is suggested by the history and can be confirmed with polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test the following day. Narcolepsy is treated with behavior modifications and medications such as stimulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sodium oxybate, and pitolisant. Obstructive sleep apnea may be diagnosed in patients with excessive snoring and witnessed apneas and can be diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Treatment consists of positive airway pressure therapy while sleeping in conjunction with weight loss.",

      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Anti‐immunoglobulin‐like cell adhesion molecule 5 (IgLON5) disease is an autoimmune encephalitis that targets the cell adhesion molecule, IgLON5. The disease presents with various clinical features, including sleep disorders, bulbar palsy, movement disorders, cognitive dysfunction and neuromuscular manifestations. Sleep disorders are characterized by parasomnias and sleep‐disordered breathing (stridor and sleep apnea). Bulbar palsy includes dysarthria, dysphagia, vocal cord paralysis and stridor. Movement disorders include a variety of symptoms and signs, such as chorea, dystonia, rigidity, tremor, myoclonus and myorhythmia. Cognitive dysfunction includes executive dysfunction, impairment of attention, and verbal and visual memory dysfunction. Neuromuscular manifestations include fasciculations in the tongue and peripheral muscles, limb weakness, and muscle atrophy. Some patients resemble those with neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. On video polysomnography, undifferentiated non‐rapid eye movement sleep and poorly structured N2 sleep are characteristic. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies are often normal or non‐specific. Human leukocyte antigen testing shows that HLA‐DRB1*10:01‐DQB1*05:01 is highly associated with the disease. Pathologically, neuronal deposition of both hyperphosphorylated 3‐repeat and 4‐repeat tau isoforms, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the hypothalamus, brainstem tegmentum, and upper cervical cord are observed. Some patients are responsive to immunotherapies, such as steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange therapy and rituximab. Factors associated with a favorable response to immunotherapies include early initiation of treatment, cerebrospinal fluid inflammation and immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) predominance of IgLON5 antibody compared with immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4). Anti‐IgLON5 disease should be suspected in patients with atypical movement disorders complicated by sleep disturbances.",

      "title": "A CLINICAL APPROACH TO DEMENTIA WITH LEWY BODIES",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND- Lewy Body disorders extend beyond Parkinson's disease (PD). Lewy bodies may be found in the brain in cortical as well as subcortical areas, termed diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD). DLBD may underlie dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a syndrome with prominent cognitive and behavioral symptoms. REVIEW SUMMARY- In DLB, dementia precedes Parkinsonism, or the two appear simultaneously. Clinical criteria for DLB include dementia, core features of fluctuation, visual hallucinations and spontaneous Parkinsonism, and supporting features. Each core feature may result from other conditions. DLB may resemble Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinically and often is found in association with AD pathology. Roughly 1/3 of patients with PD eventually develop dementia (PDD), and many show the pathology of DLBD. Many patients with DLB show a neuropsychological profile of relatively severely impaired psychomotor speed, executive function, and visuo-spatial abilities, with relative preservation of language, a pattern also seen in PD and PDD. Treatment of patients with DLB is difficult. These patients are very sensitive to neuroleptics; therefore, atypical antipsychotic drugs are preferable. Parkinsonism in DLB may respond to L-dopa or dopamine agonists. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil may lead to improvement of cognition, hallucinations, and alertness. CONCLUSIONS- DLB is a relatively common cause of dementia in the elderly. Cognitive, motor, and behavioral features help to distinguish it from AD and other conditions. The key clinical features may stabilize or improve with careful pharmacologic treatment.",

      "abstract": "Some studies have demonstrated that cognitive decline occurs in Dravet syndrome, starting shortly after the onset of seizures, rapidly progressing and then plateauing within a few years. It is unclear whether children that develop the syndrome had entirely normal cognitive skills before seizure onset, since subtle impairment easily escapes recognition in small infants. It is also difficult to demonstrate whether a recognisable profile of cognitive impairment or a definite behavioural phenotype exists. No clear‐cut imaging or neuropathological marker or substrate has been recognised for cognitive impairment in this syndrome. However, there are different potentially causative factors, including the specific effects on the Nav1.1 channels caused by the underlying genic or genomic defect; frequent and prolonged convulsive and non‐convulsive seizures or status epilepticus; recurrent subtle ictal phenomena, such as that accompanying pronounced visual sensitivity; the use of antiepileptic drugs with cognitive side effects, especially in heavy multiple‐drug therapy; and the restrictions that children with severe epilepsy inevitably undergo.",

      "title": "Autoimmune Encephalopathies",
      "abstract": "Background: Evaluation of patients with recent onset of progressive cognitive and behavioral problems can be challenging. Psychiatric disorders, metabolic derangements, toxins and infections are generally considered in the differential diagnosis along with prion disorders (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) and rapidly progressive degenerative dementias. Some subacute encephalopathies are caused by autoimmune or inflammatory mechanisms, recognized by the association with autoantibody markers and/or clear response to immunomodulatory treatment. This review describes the clinical features of these potentially reversible autoimmune encephalopathies. Review Summary: Morvan syndrome, paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE), and nonparaneoplastic autoimmune limbic encephalitis have characteristic clinical and serological features. Limbic encephalitis is characterized by short-term memory impairment, complex partial temporal lobe seizures and psychiatric symptoms. Signal abnormalities in the mesial temporal lobes without contrast enhancement are the typical MRI findings. Morvan syndrome presents with behavioral changes, hallucinations, severe insomnia, autonomic hyperactivity and neuromyotonia (spontaneous muscle activity). Corticosteroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (sometimes called Hashimoto encephalopathy) has a broad range of clinical presentation. Cognitive impairment with tremor, seizures, stroke-like events (including transient aphasia) and normal thyroid hormone levels is a common scenario. In the absence of diagnostic serological findings, clinical improvement with corticosteroids may be the only evidence of autoimmune encephalopathy. Conclusions: Autoimmune encephalopathies are an important cause of rapidly progressive cognitive and behavioral decline that probably remain under recognized. Electroencephalography, brain MRI, cerebrospinal fluid examination and serological tests are useful diagnostic tools. With increased clinical suspicion, these diseases may be diagnosed and treated successfully.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

En la enfermedad de Parkinson hay pacientes con deficit cognitivo aislado y multiple y el rendimiento cognitivo forma un abanico que va desde la normalidad hasta un avanzado grado de demencia. La mayoria de los enfermos presenta un deficit ejecutivo, aislado o combinado con otras alteraciones cognitivas, que se considera lo mas caracteristico de la enfermedad, y un 30-40% de afectados acabara presentando una demencia clinicamente definida. Desarrollo. La presencia de alteracion cognitiva leve en los enfermos parkinsonianos significa la existencia de un riesgo elevado de aparicion de demencia en el transcurso de la enfermedad. La demencia asociada con enfermedad de Parkinson esta especificamente relacionada con sintomatologia neuropsiquiatrica, que puede tener tres posibles explicaciones: alteracion de vias mesolimbicas, alteracion cortical y limbica difusa, o fenomenologia de tipo Alzheimer asociada. Los episodios psicoticos se presentan preferentemente en los pacientes con tratamiento dopaminergico y el espectro clinico de la psicosis parkinsoniana abarca: ilusiones visuales, alucinaciones visuoaudioolfatorias, delirio y psicosis alucinatoria paranoide grave. Todos los farmacos antiparkinsonianos pueden provocar alucinaciones y psicosis, pero los agonistas dopaminergicos detentan la mayor capacidad. Conclusiones. En el manejo de esta problematica es muy importante la prevencion y el diagnostico y tratamiento tan pronto hagan aparicion. Han de disminuirse las dosis de antiparkinsonianos, aunque ello no suele ser suficiente, por lo que habra que asociar antipsicoticos atipicos, que actuen preferentemente sobre receptores 5-HT y no produzcan bloqueo D2, la mayoria de las veces.",

Motor or phonic tics that persist for more than 1 year are defined as persistent (chronic) tic disorder. Tourette syndrome can be diagnosed if a child has multiple motor tics and at least one phonic tic for more than 1 year with onset before age 18 years. Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Transient and developmental movement disorders include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, jitteriness in neonates, shuddering, and stereotypies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

Several imaging and neurobiochemical biomarkers enable detection of underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology in persons with subjective cognitive impairment. Causal or disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease is still missing.

      "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) accounts for 15-20% of all autopsy confirmed dementias in old age. Characteristic histopathological changes are intracellular Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, with abundant senile plaques but sparse neurofibrillary tangles. Core clinical features are fluctuating cognitive impairment, persistent visual hallucinations and extrapyramidal motor symptoms (parkinsonism). One of these core features has to be present for a diagnosis of possible DLB, and two for probable DLB. Supportive features are repeated falls, syncope, transient loss of consciousness, neuroleptic sensitivity, delusions and hallucinations in other modalities. DLB is clinically under-diagnosed and frequently misclassified as systemic delirium or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or cerebrovascular disease. Therapeutic approaches to DLB can pose difficult dilemmas in pharmacological management. Neuroleptic medication is relatively contraindicated because some patients show severe neuroleptic sensitivity, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Antiparkinsonian medication has the potential to exacerbate psychotic symptoms and may be relatively ineffective at relieving extrapyramidal motor symptoms. Recently there is converging evidence that treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors can offer a safe alternative for the symptomatic treatment of cognitive and neuropsychiatric features in DLB. This review will focus on the clinical characteristics of DLB, its differential diagnosis and on possible management strategies.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a REM sleep parasomnia characterized by the loss of the typical muscular atonia present during healthy REM sleep. RBD can occur in the absence of other neurological conditions or in association with a neurodegenerative disorder. It is now we ll established that RBD is a strong predictor of neurodegeneration, in particular synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia (LBD), or multiple system atrophy. However, some longitudinal studies report that a minority of patients develop either overlapping form of dementia or Alzheimer disease's (AD). Although AD is reported as a possible development in patients with RBD, it is in a limited number of cases and there are concerns about the accuracy of the diagnostic criteria. Neuropsychological impairments identified in cross-sectional studies of RBD patients describe a profile similar to that observed in dementia related to synucleinopathies. However, only deficits in executive function predict the development of neurodegeneration. Longitudinal studies reported the development of AD in RBD patients in about 7% of cases with variability ranging from 3% and 11%. Since the majority of longitudinal investigations do not report AD as a possible development for RBD patients the proportion may be overestimated. The study of the relationship between RBD and AD may be confounded by two factors that lead to misdiagnosis: the use of clinical criteria alone and the overlap between the clinical features and neuropathology of AD and LBD. Future studies to investigate this association must use updated diagnostic criteria incorporating ancillary investigations.",

      "abstract": "Delirium has been considered a syndrome of generalized dysfunction of higher cortical functions due to its breadth of symptoms and associated diffuse slowing on electroencephalogram. Advances in neuropsychiatry have revealed differences between brain regions, including the hemispheres, which may underlie the constellation of symptoms among different psychiatric disorders. For example, different neural pathways are involved in major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, including lateralization to one or the other hemisphere. In this article the author proposes that delirium, too, involves particular neural pathways and that lateralization to the right may be relevant. Structural and functional neuroimaging reports and recent neuropsychological studies support this lateralization. Prefrontal cortices, anterior and right thalamus, and right basilar mesial temporoparietal cortex may play a significant role in subserving delirium symptoms and may be the 'final common pathway' for delirium from a variety of etiologies. The final common pathway may be responsible for certain 'core symptoms' (disorientation, cognitive deficits, sleep-wake cycle disturbance, disorganized thinking, and language abnormalities), while other symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, illusions, and affective lability) may occur depending on the etiology causing delirium. An imbalance in the cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems is most commonly implicated in causing delirium, and could both account for delirium symptoms and be consistent with the neuroanatomical pathways being implicated.",

It can be associated with other dramatic symptoms of a psychotic nature likely to cause diagnostic uncertainty. Methods and results: These points are illustrated by the case of a young man with a severe bipolar affective disorder who independently developed terrifying visual, auditory and somatic hallucinatory episodes at sleep onset, associated with a sense of evil influence and presence. The episodes were not obviously related to his psychiatric disorder. Past diagnoses included nightmares and night terrors. Review provided no convincing evidence of various other sleep disorders nor physical conditions in which hallucinatory experiences can occur. A diagnosis of predormital isolated sleep paralysis was made and appropriate treatment recommended. Conclusions: Sleep paralysis, common in the general population, can be associated with dramatic auxiliary symptoms suggestive of a psychotic state. Less common forms are either part of the narcolepsy syndrome or (rarely) they are familial in type. Interestingly, sleep paralysis (especially breathing difficulty) features prominently in the folklore of various countries.",

Normal consciousness can be regarded as having two separate but closely interrelated components. The first of these is the arousal component of wakefulness. It is this that keeps the patient awake and which relates to the physical manifestations of awakening from sleep—for example, eyes being open, motor activity. The second component is the content of consciousness or the awareness of self and environment. This consists of the sum of psychological functions of sensations, emotions, and thoughts.\n\nA detailed description of the pathophysiology of consciousness is beyond the scope of this article.

      "abstract": "The olfactory system participates in the reception, integration, and interpretation of olfactory signals. This chemical sense is essential for survival since it is involved in basic behaviors and physiological processes. Olfactory function decreases with age; however, olfactory impairments are also observed in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric pathologies. It is widely described that olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom in Parkinson (PD) and Alzheimer (AD) diseases, furthermore, olfactory brain areas are affected by the pathological hallmarks of these diseases before the brain areas involved in the motor and cognitive impairments, respectively. This information suggests a key role of olfactory system damage in the beginning of a neurodegenerative process. Not only does the early injury of the olfactory system occur in AD and PD, but also in other pathologies since increasing evidence indicate the presence of olfactory impairments in other neurogenerative and psychiatric diseases namely, depression, schizophrenia, and autism among others. In addition, people with systemic chronic diseases that promote central nervous system damage such as type 2 diabetes and obesity also show olfactory dysfunction, which also suggests that olfactory alterations in these individuals could be an early manifestation of a neurodegenerative process. Then, the aim of the manuscript is to describe the information which supports that olfactory system impairment is a prodromal factor for the development of several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, to recognize it as a shared mechanism of degeneration among diverse neuropathologies, and discuss the relevance of the assessment of the olfactory function in the diagnosis and improvement of neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cognition is the action or faculty of knowing—knowledge—implying consciousness. The complex faculty is taken to include orientation, attention, memory, language functions, gnosis, visual perception, comprehension, abstraction, reasoning, constructional praxis, judgement, and new learning. Definitions of dementia emphasize memory loss, the presence of other cognitive disturbances, a progressive course, and the presence of diffuse brain disease. Thus the DSM-IIIR criteria for probable Alzheimer’s disease require the presence of dementia; deficits in two or more areas of cognition; progression; normal consciousness; and the absence of other diagnosable pathologies. The diagnosis is supported by progressive deterioration of specific cognitive skills; impaired Activities of Daily Living and inappropriate behaviour; positive family history; normal cerebrospinal fluid; normal electro-encephalography (EEG) or non-specific changes only; and CT evidence of cerebral atrophy. But to require the absence of other pathologies begs the question as to the diagnosis and makes the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease one of exclusion. In this chapter, we will survey briefly those conditions which fulfil many of the criteria for Alzheimer’s disease but exhibit physical signs or other clinical features which disallow that diagnosis. As there are so many of them, those occurring less frequently are included in an appendix at the end of this chapter.",

      "abstract": "Complex visual hallucinations may affect some normal individuals on going to sleep and are also seen in pathological states, often in association with a sleep disturbance. The content of these hallucinations is striking and relatively stereotyped, often involving animals and human figures in bright colours and dramatic settings. Conditions causing these hallucinations include narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome, peduncular hallucinosis, treated idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia without treatment, migraine coma, Charles Bonnet syndrome (visual hallucinations of the blind), schizophrenia, hallucinogen-induced states and epilepsy. We describe cases of hallucinosis due to several of these causes and expand on previous hypotheses to suggest three mechanisms underlying complex visual hallucinations. (i) Epileptic hallucinations are probably due to a direct irritative process acting on cortical centres integrating complex visual information. (ii) Visual pathway lesions cause defective visual input and may result in hallucinations from defective visual processing or an abnormal cortical release phenomenon. (iii) Brainstem lesions appear to affect ascending cholinergic and serotonergic pathways, and may also be implicated in Parkinson's disease. These brainstem abnormalities are often associated with disturbances of sleep. We discuss how these lesions, outside the primary visual system, may cause defective modulation of thalamocortical relationships leading to a release phenomenon. We suggest that perturbation of a distributed matrix may explain the production of similar, complex mental phenomena by relatively blunt insults at disparate sites.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes is gaining increased clinical significance. The neurochemical and neuropathological basis in the various parkinsonian forms and even in an individual patient are not fully elucidated yet and could be heterogeneous. Loss of dopaminergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic innervation has been suggested to be the underlying neurochemical deficits for cognitive impairment and dementia in PD, but the onset of cognitive impairment and the progression to dementia may not share the same underlying neurochemical basis. Similarly, pathological evidence is also heterogeneous, ranging from subcortical pathology, limbic or cortical Lewy body type degeneration, and Alzheimer's type pathology that can be found even in the same patient with PD dementia (PDD). Typically, the prototype of early cognitive deficit in PD is a dysexecutive syndrome, but other cognitive domains are more involved when dementia develops, mainly including visuospatial, language and memory dysfunction. Functional radionuclide neuroimaging, by means of single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography, are contributing to characterize the topographic cortical pattern of cognitive impairment, as well as to define the underlying neurochemical deficit. Lastly, the advent of amyloid PET may help clarifying the meaning of amyloid load in diffuse Lewy body disease and PDD. Knowing the neurochemical and pathophysiological substrate of cognitive deficit in patients with PD or other degenerative Parkinsonisms may help the clinician in understanding the clinical condition of an individual patient in order to plan pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention. The introduction of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for therapy of PDD is an example of information integration between clinical-neuropsychological and pathophysiological-neurochemical aspects obtained also with the key contribution of functional neuroimaging.",

Field loss # Appearance of retina, macula, and optic nerve In assessing a patient who has experienced an acute disturbance of vision in an uninflamed eye an accurate history is crucial, because it may be that a longstanding visual defect has only just been noticed by the patient. It is important to make this differentiation as this alters the range of diagnoses and the urgency of treatment. Acute visual disturbance of unknown cause requires urgent referral. In many cases the diagnosis may be made from the history. Symptoms of floaters or flashing lights suggest a vitreous detachment, a vitreous haemorrhage, or a retinal detachment. Horizontal field loss usually indicates a retinal vascular problem, whereas a vertical defect suggests an abnormality posterior to the optic chiasm. If there is central field loss (I can't see things in the centre) there may be a disorder at the macula. Associated symptoms such as headache may indicate giant cell arteritis or migraine. The visual acuity gives a strong clue to the diagnosis. A total lack of perception of light indicates complete occlusion of either the central retinal artery or the arteries supplying the head of the optic nerve. The nature of the field defect gives clues as outlined above. Obstruction of the red reflex on ophthalmoscopy suggests a vitreous haemorrhage, although the patient may have a pre-existing cataract. The appearances of the macula, remaining retina, and head of the optic nerve will indicate the diagnosis if there has been a haemorrhage or arterial or venous occlusion in these areas.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neurometabolic diseases are a group of disorders that lead to a disruption in the normal metabolism within the body and nervous system. Abnormalities of metabolic processes at any level can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical features and pathologies. The nervous system is particularly susceptible to metabolic derangements, either inborn or acquired. Early diagnosis can prevent or delay damage to the nervous system through appropriate treatment when possible. Many neurometabolic disorders have poor prognoses, and patients often present and succumb within months to the early years of life; however, some disorders can present later in life with varying levels of severity. In many later onset cases, the diagnosis is preceded by nonspecific symptoms including psychiatric manifestations. In addition to psychiatric manifestations, various neurological features often occur at some point in the course of the disease. Of these features, movement disorders are particularly common. In fact, many neurometabolic diseases will present with subtle movement disorders that are often missed or overlooked. Many congenital metabolic diseases are rapidly neurodegenerative and, due to the nature of such diseases, result in early demise or severe cognitive decline. While by no means exhaustive, this chapter aims to outline and discuss some of the neurometabolic diseases that present with both psychiatric and movement disorders as prominent features.",

      "abstract": "Intellectual impairment, negative symptoms, and medication history were assessed in chronic schizophrenic patients with and without abnormal involuntary movements (tardive dyskinesia). Patients with involuntary movements had received neither longer nor more intensive treatment with neuroleptics or anticholinergics. However, the presence or absence of involuntary movements was prominently associated with the presence or absence of intellectual impairment/negative symptoms; these features are characteristic of the defect state/type II syndrome of schizophrenia, in which structural abnormalities of the brain may be over-represented. The role of subtle organic changes in conferring vulnerability to the emergence of such involuntary movements should be re-evaluated.",

      "abstract": "More than 20 studies of schizophrenia have found a three-factor model of symptom complexes or syndromes consisting of hallucinations/delusions, disorganization of thought and behavior, and negative symptoms. Several lines of evidence suggest that these syndromes relate to neurobiological differences. We examined the relationship of these three syndromes to neurological signs.The relationships among the subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale and hallucinations/delusions, disorganization, and the deficit syndrome were examined in 83 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients with the deficit syndrome have enduring, idiopathic (or primary) negative symptoms.Each of the three syndromes had a distinctive pattern of relationships to neurological signs. Disorganization was significantly related to the total score on the Neurological Evaluation Scale, to sensory integration, and to the sequencing of complex motor acts. The deficit syndrome was significantly related to sensory integration only. Neither hallucinations/delusions nor a continuous measure of negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (that measured both primary and secondary negative symptoms, as well as enduring and transient symptoms) was related to any of the Neurological Evaluation Scale subscales or total score. Drug treatment was not related to neurological impairment.The results further support the neurobiological significance of the three clinical syndromes of schizophrenia. Ratings on a scale measuring negative symptoms appear to be less sensitive to neurobiological correlates than is the categorization of the presence or absence of the deficit syndrome.",

      "abstract": "The so-called neurological paraneoplastic syndromes (NPNS) are a group of diseases of the central nervous system of unknown etiology which are seen almost exclusively in patients with cancer. We review the main NPNS paying particular attention to those with ophthalmological and otological features.Certain neuro-ophthalmological findings may constitute, at least partly, some paraneoplastic syndromes. There are alterations of vision in paraneoplastic retinopathy and in optic neuritis of paraneoplastic origin. The latter, unlike the retinopathy, usually coexists with involvement of other structures of the nervous system. Oculomotor function is affected in the opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. Diplopia and/or ophthalmoplegia may be a predominant or initial symptom, in patients with paraneoplastic neurological degeneration or brainstem encephalitis. In the Lambert-Eaton syndrome and in paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, may have blurred vision and alterations of the pupil. Cases of paraneoplastic uveitis have also been described. Paraneoplastic otological involvement is less frequent. Patients with sensorineural deafness in the context of a paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis have been reported. In the NPNS vertigo is caused by cerebellar or brainstem lesions and not by lesions of peripheral organs. When nystagmus occurs in a NPNS it may be of various types and is due to involvement of structures in the brain stem or cerebellum.The diagnosis of NPNS in patients with no known cancer is important because it may lead to the detection of an occult cancer which is localized or scarcely extended, and therefore is still potentially treatable. Oto-neuro-ophthalmological manifestations may be the first or only symptom of presentation of a paraneoplastic neurological clinical picture.",

      "title": "Poor insight in psychosis and meta-representation models",
      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

Autopsy, which was performed in 2 of the cases, revealed Lewy bodies in various nervous tissues including autonomic nervous systems in both cases. 7 cases of probable DLBD and 8 cases of possible DLBD, which lacked fluctuating cognition and/or visual hallucinations, demonstrated neither of repeated falls, syncope, nor transient loss of consciousness. Episodes of these supportive features, which seem to be associated with autonomic dysfunctions and/or fluctuating cognition, should be important in the differential diagnosis of DLBD.",

Its symptoms are not specific and often the patients are mistaken as Parkinson s disease patients, or even Alzheimer s ones.Initial features in progressive supranuclear paralysis are typically a gait disorder with frequent falls, behavioral disorder and often dysarthria. The gaze disorder, showing voluntary conjugate gase paralysis is characteristic, but it can appear late in the course of disease. Other motor signs are axial rigidity, bradykinesia, stiffness, and rarely chorea, ataxia, muscle weakness or myoclonus. Pseudobulbar paralysis is the more remarkable clinical finding. These motor symptoms are accompanied by cognitive disturbances, the typical ones of subcortical dementia, with mind slowness, apathy, depression, and, more often that in other primary dementias, psychotic features and relatively early behavioral disorders. A useful feature to distinguish the mental changes of progressive supranuclear paralysis with other primary subcortical dementias is a more remarkable impairment in visuospatial function, because of the need of a good gaze function to accomplish it. Progressive supranuclear paralysis patients work better in verbal tests that in visuospatial test. We try to describe clinical data and evolutive profile of this entity, whose cognitive disturbances as described by Albert in 1974 strongly stabilized the concept of subcortical dementia.",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

      "title": "The clinical characteristics of dementia with Lewy bodies and a consideration of prodromal diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common type of degenerative dementia following Alzheimer’s disease (AD). DLB is clinically and pathologically related to Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD dementia, and the three disorders can be viewed as existing on a spectrum of Lewy body disease. In recent years there has been a concerted effort to establish the phenotypes of AD and PD in the prodromal phase (before the respective syndromes of cognitive and motor impairment are expressed). Evidence for the prodromal presentation of DLB is also emerging. This paper briefly reviews what is known about the clinical presentation of prodromal DLB before discussing the pathology of Lewy body disease and how this relates to potential biomarkers of prodromal DLB. The presenting features of DLB can be broadly placed in three categories: cognitive impairment (particularly nonamnestic cognitive impairments), behavioural/psychiatric phenomena (for example, hallucinations, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD)) and physical symptoms (for example, parkinsonism, decreased sense of smell, autonomic dysfunction). Some noncognitive symptoms such as constipation, RBD, hyposmia and postural dizziness can predate the onset of memory impairment by several years in DLB. Pathological studies of Lewy body disease have found that the earliest sites of involvement are the olfactory bulb, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve, the peripheral autonomic nervous system, including the enteric nervous system, and the brainstem. Some of the most promising early markers for DLB include the presence of RBD, autonomic dysfunction or hyposmia, 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine cardiac scintigraphy, measures of substantia nigra pathology and skin biopsy for α-synuclein in peripheral autonomic nerves. In the absence of disease-modifying therapies, the diagnosis of prodromal DLB is of limited use in the clinic. That said, knowledge of the prodromal development of DLB could help clinicians identify cases of DLB where the diagnosis is uncertain. Prodromal diagnosis is of great importance in research, where identifying Lewy body disease at an earlier stage may allow researchers to investigate the initial phases of dementia pathophysiology, develop treatments designed to interrupt the development of the dementia syndrome and accurately identify the patients most likely to benefit from these treatments.",

This risk exists in a wide range of collectively very common sleep disorders which need to be considered in explaining insomnia, excessive sleepiness or disturbed episodes of behaviour associated with sleep (parasomnias). Examples given include circadian sleep–wake cycle disorders (such as the delayed sleep phase syndrome), obstructive sleep apnoea, narcolepsy, Kleine–Levin syndrome, sleep paralysis and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder.

The frequency of arousals from slow-wave sleep with delta or mixed-frequency activity has a high sensitivity but relatively low specificity for the diagnosis of arousal parasomnias.Disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals) are characterized by incomplete awakenings from slow-wave sleep, limited recall of imagery, and partial or complete amnesia. They occur most frequently in childhood. Management includes correction of precipitating factors, attention to safety, behavioral techniques, and medications. Sleep-related eating disorder is a variant of arousal disorders and may be associated with the use of short-acting hypnotics and restless legs syndrome. Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations can occur with visual loss, dementia with Lewy bodies, use of β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and anxiety. Exploding head syndrome occurs at wake-sleep transition or on waking during the night, is usually benign, and requires treatment only if significant sleep disruption occurs.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a disease itself but mostly a clinical sign of an underlying disease. Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation. Agrypnia excitata is the term that aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Neurometabolic diseases are complex group of rare neurogenetic disorders, which are difficult to diagnose. Patients may have toxic metabolite accumulation, inadequate energy supply, or neurotransmitter deficiency, resulting in a variety of clinical manifestations and severity with enzyme activity or transporter function defects. Multiple organ involvement is frequently seen, among which neurological symptoms and signs are one of the most encountered problems. Ocular motor problems deserve special attention for it occurs in some inborn error of metabolism. Furthermore, some are early signs or characteristic findings of certain diseases, such as the gaze palsy in Niemann-Pick disease type C and Gaucher disease or oculogyric crisis in neurotransmitter diseases. Early recognition and intervention are important for better prognosis in treatable neurometabolic disorders. In addition, ways to evaluate and describe eye movement problems also help to demonstrate the severity or clinical progression for those diagnosed with certain neurometabolic diseases. However, the complexity of eye movement and ocular motor control renders our clinical observation, recording and even anatomic localization of abnormal eye movements. Clinicians are more likely to detect early signs and unravel problems by gaining awareness of abnormal eye movement. This study amied to approach neurometabolic diseases in children via eye motor manifestations.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is characterized by a variety of cognitive dysfunctions. Information-processing dysfunctions differ between clinical subtypes such that nonparanoid schizophrenia patients attend less than paranoid schizophrenia patients to connotative or contextual aspects of stimuli. The positive and negative symptom dimensions are also associated with distinct cognitive deficits. In general, positive symptoms are related to auditory-processing deficits and negative symptoms to visual/motor dysfunctions. The interaction of frontal and septohippocampal brain systems, and failures of information-processing automaticity and self-monitoring, have been proposed as the bases of positive symptoms. Negative symptoms are thought to arise from abnormalities in the complex interactions of frontal and striatal systems. Recent theoretical analyses have recommended a focus on the cognitive and neuropsychological analysis of specific symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) instead of on the more heterogeneous symptom clusters or dimensions. Studies of specific symptoms indicate that patients with hallucinations have deficits in discriminating the source of information. Delusions have been related to abnormal inference processes as well as abnormal perceptual experiences. Studies should now examine the links between information-processing abnormalities and symptoms over time, as the latter change, within the framework of explicit, disconfirmable theoretical models.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

Multiple system atrophy is a complex syndrome, in which patients exhibit a variety of signs and symptoms, including parkinsonism, ataxia and autonomic dysfunction. It can be difficult to separate MSA from the other parkinsonian syndromes but if ocular signs and symptoms are present, they may aid differential diagnosis. Typical ocular features of MSA include blepharospasm, excessive square-wave jerks, mild to moderate hypometria of saccades, impaired vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR), nystagmus and impaired event-related evoked potentials. Less typical features include slowing of saccadic eye movements, the presence of vertical gaze palsy, visual hallucinations and an impaired electroretinogram (ERG). Aspects of primary vision such as visual acuity, colour vision or visual fields are usually unaffected. Management of the disease to deal with problems of walking, movement, daily tasks and speech problems is important in MSA. Optometrists can work in collaboration with the patient and health-care providers to identify and manage the patient's visual deficits. A more specific role for the optometrist is to correct vision to prevent falls and to monitor the anterior eye to prevent dry eye and control blepharospasm.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Diseases of the basal ganglia are common in the elderly. Although motor disturbances are usually the presenting symptom, neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequent and have important clinical consequences. This paper reviews recent studies of hallucinations, depression and dementia in Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Recent findings Dementia eventually develops in the majority of Parkinson's disease patients, and is associated with a twofold increase in mortality. Studies comparing clinical and pathological features of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies suggest that Parkinson's disease patients with dementia are indistinguishable from patients diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies, except for the sequence of symptom onset, suggesting a similar biological abnormality in the two syndromes. Visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease are associated with impaired object recognition, recognition memory and reality monitoring, and with rapid-eye-movement sleep disturbances. One trial showed an improvement of cognition in Parkinson's disease with dementia on donepezil, and open-label studies suggested that cholinergic drugs may also improve hallucinations. A negative study with sertraline supported other research, indicating that serotonergic disturbances may not be the key aetiological factor of depression in Parkinson's disease. Studies of neuropsychiatric features in patients with atypical parkinsonian disorders suggest that these common symptoms may provide diagnostic information. Summary Emerging evidence demonstrates a high prevalence and important clinical consequences of neuropsychiatric symptoms in elderly patients with basal ganglia disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease. Such findings provide clues to the underlying pathophysiology and potential treatment of these features. Large-scale clinical trials are warranted for the treatment of dementia and depression in Parkinson's disease.",

The Stroop effect is our tendency to experience difficulty naming a physical color when it is used to spell the name of a different color. It is a neuropsychological test extensively used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute, well-known as the Stroop Effect. The childhood disorder is an any illness, impairment, or abnormal condition that affects primarily infants and children. Some of the childhood disorders like Mild Mental Retardation, Learning Disorders, Motor Skills Disorders, Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorders, Eating disorders of infancy or early childhood, Tic disorders. Visual perceptual discrimination is the brainÂ’s ability to accurately perceive information in a complex, fluid and confusing situation and, even more importantly, to accurately differentiate amongst confusable types of information and ability to identify detail seeing Items like differences in shape, color and orientation. Objectives: The main purpose of this study is to assess the level of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders. To evaluate the level of visual perceptual discrimination before and after administration of Stroop task performance among various childhood disorders. To associate the level of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables. Materials and Methods: The research approach used in the study was Quantitative in nature. Pre Â–Experimental One group Pre- test Post test design was used. Purposive Sampling technique was used to select the samples. A total of 30 ChildrenÂ’s with various childhood disorders were selected for this study. Visual Perceptual Discrimination checklist was used to assess the Visual Perceptual Discrimination Problems among children with childhood disorder and administering stroop task performance using Flashcard was used for intervention and Post test was conducted by using same tool in same manner. Results and Conclusion: The result showed that majority of the childhood disorders at selected home 26(86.7%) had low and 4(13.3%) had moderate level of visual perceptual discrimination during Pre test. The Calculated pairedÂ‘tÂ’ value was t= -8.55 and was found to be statistically significant at -P=&lt;0.001 level. After Intervention majority of childhood disorders at selected home 16(53.3%) had low and 14(46.7%) had moderate level of visual perceptual discrimination. There was area of residence and type of childhood disorders had shown statistically significant association between post testlevel of visual perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables. The other demographic variable had not shown statistically significant association between the post-test level of visual Perceptual discrimination among various childhood disorders with their selected demographic variables .The researcher concluded that by administering Stroop task performance shows that the intervention helps in improving the level of visual perceptual discrimination in good range and found to be one of the helpful interventions in improving the level of visual perceptual discrimination among children with various childhood disorders.

      "abstract": "Although a universally accepted definition is lacking, mild traumatic brain injury and concussion are classified by transient loss of consciousness, amnesia, altered mental status, a Glasgow Coma Score of 13 to 15, and focal neurologic deficits following an acute closed head injury. Most patients recover quickly, with a predictable clinical course of recovery within the first one to two weeks following traumatic brain injury. Persistent physical, cognitive, or behavioral postconcussive symptoms may be noted in 5 to 20 percent of persons who have mild traumatic brain injury. Physical symptoms include headaches, dizziness, and nausea, and changes in coordination, balance, appetite, sleep, vision, and hearing. Cognitive and behavioral symptoms include fatigue, anxiety, depression, and irritability, and problems with memory, concentration and decision making. Women, older adults, less educated persons, and those with a previous mental health diagnosis are more likely to have persistent symptoms. The diagnostic workup for subacute to chronic mild traumatic brain injury focuses on the history and physical examination, with continuing observation for the development of red flags such as the progression of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms, seizure, progressive vomiting, and altered mental status. Early patient and family education should include information on diagnosis and prognosis, symptoms, and further injury prevention. Symptom-specific treatment, gradual return to activity, and multidisciplinary coordination of care lead to the best outcomes. Psychiatric and medical comorbidities, psychosocial issues, and legal or compensatory incentives should be explored in patients resistant to treatment.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

      "title": "A Case Series of Unilateral Peripheral Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background and Aims Peripheral neuropathy may present with a variety of phenotypes depending on the pattern of weakness and sensory loss, the neurophysiological characteristics (axonal or demyelinating) and additional features such as involvement of the autonomic nervous system or the cranial nerves. The most common phenotype is a symmetrical length‐dependent sensory and motor neuropathy. Other phenotypes include non‐length‐dependent forms such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) or a sensory neuronopathy or ganglionopathy. Asymmetric forms of neuropathy are mostly represented by mononeuritis multiplex and Lewis‐Sumner syndrome or focal CIDP. Unilateral weakness or sensory loss respecting the midline is mainly due to pathology in the central nervous system and is unusual in peripheral neuropathy. Methods We evaluated the clinical and genetic features of three unrelated individuals with a peripheral neuropathy affecting one side of the body. Results We describe three unrelated patients (two female and one male) with a slowly progressive peripheral neuropathy restricted to one side of the body. Each case is marked by onset in early childhood with the absence of a family history or a structural lesion of the central nervous system. Neurophysiology demonstrated an axonal type of neuropathy in two cases and conduction slowing supportive of a demyelinating neuropathy type in one. Genetic testing was performed in the three cases, specifically looking for variants in genes associated with Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMT) but none were identified in DNA extracted from blood. Interpretation A unilateral, slowly progressive peripheral neuropathy is a rare phenomenon, and we propose the cause of this unusual phenotype to be due to a mosaic or chimeric form of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMT).",

      "abstract": "It is a commonly held misperception that practitioners of sleep medicine are highly dependent on sophisticated investigative techniques to diagnose and treat sleep-disordered patients. The inability to focus or maintain concentration is the most disabling aspect of conditions causing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), described as 'brain fog' or even masquerading as dementia. The commonest causes of mild and severe EDS are probably insufficient sleep and poor quality overnight sleep, respectively. Sleep onset or sleep maintainance insomnia can reflect an idiopathic or primary phenomenon but is more often secondary to a variety of disorders, including other primary sleep disorders. In patients with underlying neuropathies, radiculopathies or demyelinating disease, restless legs syndrome (RLS) may be secondary to the primary diagnosis and should not be overlooked. The nocturnal disturbances are usually of more concern to the bed partner who may incur injuries from violent dream enactment.",

      "title": "Diabetes mellitus and the brain : special emphasis on cognitive function : review",
      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem. Cognitive deficits are common with DM which range from subclinical or subtle to severe deficits such as dementia. Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia are causes of cognitive impairment with DM. In patients with DM, not only severe hypoglycaemia but also recurrent mild or moderate hypoglyacemia have deleterious effect on the brain. Recurrent mild/moderate hypoglycaemia is associated with intellectual decline, reduced attention, impaired mental abilities and memory deficits. Hypoglycaemia may result in abnormalities of neuronal plasticity, synaptic weakening and scattered neuronal death in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic hyperglycaemia in type 1 and type 2 DM is associated with low IQ (verbal, performance and total) and abnormalities in testing for different domains of cognitive function such as verbal relations, comprehension, visual reasoning, pattern analysis, quantitation, memory, learning, mental control, psychomotor efficiency, mental and motor processing speed and executive function. The suggested mechanisms incriminated in the pathogenesis of hyperglycaemia-related cognitive dysfunction include, macro- and microvascular disease or vasculopathy, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, stress response, direct toxic effect of chronic hyperglycaemia on the brain, advanced glycation end-products, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Hyperglycaemia causes oxidative stress, amyloidosis, angiopathy, abnormal lipid peroxidation, accumulation of β-amyloid and tau phosphorylation, neuro-inflammation, mitochondrial pathology, apoptosis and neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus. Depression has been identified as a risk for accelerated cognitive decline with DM. The knowledge that diagnosis at an early age, frequency of hypoglycaemia, poor glycaemic control and presence of risk factors negatively affect cognitive functions in DM will have important implications for treatment and research purposes.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State",
      "abstract": "Consciousness is a multifaceted concept that has two dimensions: arousal, or wakefulness (i.e., level of consciousness), and awareness (i.e., content of consciousness) (Laureys et al., 2004).An accurate and reliable assessment of the arousal and awareness of consciousness in patients with severe brain damage is of greatest importance for the differential diagnosis of low levels consciousness patients and for outcome evaluation.Following coma, some patients permanently lose all brainstem function (brain death), some progress to \"wakeful unawareness\" (vegetative state -VS), whereas others recover typically and progress through different stages before fully or partly recovering consciousness (minimally conscious state -MCS).Patients in VS can open their eyes and exhibit basic orienting responses, but show no conscious, purposeful activity.Reflex and other movements are seen, mediated by brainstem, spinal cord, and brainstem-diencephalic arousal systems (Laureys et al., 2004).VS can occur after patients emerge from an acute catastrophic brain insult causing coma, or can also be seen in degenerative or congenital nervous system disorders.The two common findings are necrosis of the cerebral cortex, thalamus and brainstem (usually after anoxic injury) and diffuse axonal injury (usually after trauma), although other pathological findings can be seen in degenerative and other disorders (Laureys, 2008).The MCS patients do not meet diagnostic criteria for coma or VS because they demonstrate some inconsistent but clear evidence of consciousness (Laureys et al., 2008;Giacino et al., 2002).In the MCS, there is variable impaired function of the cerebral cortex, diencephalons and upper brainstem.This allows occasional conscious behaviours to occur, unlike in VS or coma.Patients may enter the MCS as they emerge from coma or VS, or they can become minimally conscious as a result of acute injury or chronic degenerative diseases.Recent studies suggest a number of potential clinical and rehabilitative applications of magnetic resonance (MR) techniques.Although bedside clinical examination remains the criterion standard for establishing diagnosis, MR may provide an adjunctive diagnostic role when behavioural findings are very limited or ambiguous.The future of diagnostic and prognostic assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) envisions a battery of neurobehavioral and neuroimaging techniques (such as structural and functional MR imaging (MRI and www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging -Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience 182 fMRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), fiber tracking, positron emission tomography (PET)) that serve as complementary clinical tools that may help differentiate the effects of underarousal, sensory impairment, motor dysfunction, and cognitive disturbance in the search for potential causes of behavioural unresponsiveness. Magnetic Resonance and Magnetization Transfer ImagingThe morphological MRI acquisitions usually include non-contrast-enhanced sagittal T1, axial diffusion, axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial T2-SE, coronal T2 sequences and a 3D T1-weighted volume acquisition.FLAIR and T2-SE sequences permit to detect brain edema, contusion, hematoma, herniation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus.T2 sequences are useful in detecting hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injuries (DAI).The total number of lesions detected by FLAIR and T2 are shown to be inversely correlated with Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of traumatic coma patients; while the 3D T1 sequence provides an opportunity to evaluate the brain atrophy during the follow up of these patients.A lot of studies performed on traumatic coma patients with conventional MRI showed that lesions of the pons, midbrain, and basal ganglia were predictive of poor outcome especially when they are bilateral.Despite their encouraging results, these studies fail to explain why some patients in VS or with long-term marked cognitive impairments have no or minimal lesions on conventional MRI examination.This raises the question of the lack of specificity and insufficient sensitivity of conventional MR sequences which fail to reveal lesions such as ischemic axonal injuries.Therefore, it is clear that morphological and conventional MRI alone cannot be considered as a reliable tool to assess consciousness disorders severity or to predict their evolution and outcome (Tshibanda et al., 2009).Several studies investigated patients in VS and in MCS using non-conventional, quantitative and volumetric MR techniques, useful to provide information about the anatomical patterns, the prognosis and the outcome of these patients.Ammermann et al. (2007) have used volumetric analysis of MRI to determine the pattern of lesions in 12 patients with a severe neurological impairment after acute ischemic injury.At the time of scanning, the patients were either in VS or in an early remising state, that is MCS.Lesions were classified as having been present in the gray and/or white matter in four different brain regions (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital).An additional separate evaluation was performed for the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem.The total clinical follow-up period of all patients from the time of the causative event lasted for at least 5 months.The clinical outcomes were reported according to the Rancho Los Amigos Cognitive Scale (RLACS) as a universal guide to assess a patient's level of functioning.The final RLACS levels were correlated to the MRI lesion size with a Spearman correlation.All patients demonstrated extensive white matter lesions, with the largest lesions observed in the frontal and occipital lobe.A preferential involvement of the white matter located in the periventricular area and in the subcortical regions below the motor and internal temporal cortices was found, in addition to the classifically described lesions of the striatum, motor and occipital cortices.Lesion magnitude showed an association with the severity of the outcome as quantitatively assessed by RLACS.With respect to gray matter lesions, the vulnerability pattern observed included frontal and occipital and in some cases parietal cortical areas, moreover in most cases the thalamus.Additionally, almost all of patients showed lesions of the hippocampus or lesions to the basal ganglia.An association between the extent of the MRI defined lesions located within the white matter and the clinical www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State 183 outcomes of the patients was found.All patients in the most unfavorable class III clinical outcome group (i.e.persistent VS) exhibited white matter lesions exceeding 2/3 of the volume of at least one lobe, most frequently the occipital lobe.Moreover, Juengling et al. ( 2005) investigated 5 patients in persistent VS due to prolonged cerebral hypoxia of non-traumatic origin, using combined Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) of 3D MRI and FDG-PET analysis.In the analysis of the regional distribution of gray matter atrophy, VBM revealed multiple areas of significantly decreased gray matter density at p<.001, corrected for multiple comparisons.Those were localized in multiple cortical areas, in particular including inferior parietal lobe, superior and medial frontal lobe, paracentral lobule, superior and medial temporal lobe, the cingulum, and the fusiform gyrus.Thalamic changes were limited to small voxel clusters in dorso-medial areas.These structural atrophic changes were compared with the local distribution of functional loss as assessed by regional hypometabolism in the FDG-PET group analysis.At the threshold pb0.001 (corrected for multiple comparisons), PET showed a widespread pattern of hypometabolic areas.In particular, the parietal and frontotemporal cortices, the cuneus/precuneus, the cingulum, the frontal medial and precentral gyrus, and the transverse temporal gyrus were involved, additionally the bilateral thalamus (mainly dorsomedial subnucleus).All changes were, similar to the VBM results, nearly symmetrical.Improved understanding of this complex lesion pattern gained by in vivo group analyses like here might help to provide deeper insights into the general pathoanatomy of patients in the persistent VS.Using high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and a novel approach to shape analysis applied SIENAX software, Fernandez-Espejo et al. ( 2010) investigated thalamic global and regional changes in a sample of patients in a VS or an MCS.They found that total thalamic volume was significantly lower in patients than in healthy volunteers.Shape analysis revealed significant bilateral regional atrophy in the dorso-medial body in patients compared to controls; this atrophy was more widespread in VS than in MCS patients.Lower thalamic volume was significantly correlated with worsening of Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores.Shape analysis suggested that the dorso-medial nucleus and the internal medullar lamina were the main regions responsible for this correlation.These findings suggest that MCS and VS patients present different patterns of regional thalamic abnormalities.In particular, VS patients showed a more widespread pattern of atrophy than controls, producing differences in global thalamic volume.MCS patients did not show volumetric differences compared to controls, and regionally they showed a less pronounced inward collapse in both the dorsal and ventral areas, with the anterior-ventral body significantly spared.Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that thalamic damage is less common in MCS than in VS patients (Jennett et al., 2001).Another quantitative RM technique is the Magnetization Transfer Imaging (MTI).The MTI relies on the principle that protons bound in structures exhibit T1 relaxation coupling with protons in the aqueous phase.When an off-resonance saturation pulse is applied, it selectively saturates those protons that are bound in macromolecules.These protons subsequently exchange longitudinal magnetization with free water protons, leading to a reduction in the detected signal intensity (Sinson et al., 2001).The MTI may provide a quantitative index of the structural integrity of tissue and might be useful to study the outcome of patients with low levels of consciousness.However, further studies, on larger groups of patients, need to be performed to confirm the usefulness of quantitative MRI in the assessment of the eventual neurological prognosis and outcome of these challenging patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

Furthermore, in some forms of complex partial epilepsy, motor problems and behavior disorders can be observed, specially in adolescents with temporary lobe epilepsy. Other forms of epilepsy, such as the atypical benign partial epilepsy or the Landau-Kleffner syndrome, can present a certain degree of cognitive deterioration in the evolution, although they can recover later lost functions, totally or partially. The evolution of some refractory epilepsy, as patients are submitted to a multiple treatments, can make us suspect a degenerative disease.

      "abstract": "Neurological assessment of critically ill patients requires physical examination although coexisting cognitive impairment, sedative or paralytic medication, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular weakness, injuries or surgery involving extracranial tissues may limit sensitivity and specificity of findings. Notwithstanding these constraints, neurological signs and syndromes are valuable indicators of severity of illness and prognosis. Common neurologic syndromes in ICU patients include disturbances in the level of arousal and in cognition, delirium, seizures, generalized weakness, and focal neurological deficits. Whenever possible, neurological examination should include an assessment of mental status, attention, cranial nerves, motor and sensory findings. If there is persisting diagnostic uncertainty additional testing should be sought. Computed tomography of the head should be obtained whenever there is a new onset of seizures, focal neurologic deficits, alteration of mental status or loss of consciousness which are not immediately reversible or explainable. Magnetic resonance imaging has greater sensitivity for demyelinating and inflammatory diseases, hyperacute ischemic stroke, microhemorrhagic lesions, anoxic-ischemic damage, and disorders affecting the white matter and the brainstem. Electroencephalography is needed if seizures or status epilepticus are suspected as a cause or consequence of acute brain dysfunction. Somatosensory evoked potentials, best studied in patients with anoxic brain injury may help with prognostication following cardiac arrest. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocities should be obtained when neuromuscular weakness is severe or cannot be assessed clinically.",

This paper reviews recent findings regarding the ocular manifestations in multiple sclerosis. Recent findings Manifestations of multiple sclerosis in the eye include both the afferent and efferent visual pathways. Optic neuritis, the most common ocular manifestation of multiple sclerosis, may be the initial clinical disease manifestation. Recent long-term follow-up data show that most patients with demyelinating optic neuritis have an excellent prognosis for recovery of central visual acuity. Evidence is emerging, however, for significant and broad reduction in both contrast sensitivity and color perception in multiple sclerosis patients despite near-normal visual acuities. Ocular motor deficits in multiple sclerosis include internuclear ophthalmoplegia and nystagmus, resulting in diplopia, oscillopsia, blurred visual, loss of stereopsis, and reading fatigue. Multiple sclerosis also may be associated with ocular inflammatory diseases, in particular pars planitis and retinal periphlebitis. Summary Ocular findings may be initial manifestations of multiple sclerosis and may predict additional demyelinating events. Recognizing these syndromes and signs will help clinicians to properly evaluate the patient, formulate an appropriate differential diagnosis, be able to discuss the prognosis with the patient, and help develop an effective therapeutic plan.",

      "title": "MECR-Related Neurologic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics MECR-related neurologic disorder is characterized by a progressive childhood-onset movement disorder and optic atrophy; intellect is often – but not always – preserved. The movement disorder typically presents between ages one and 6.5 years and is mainly dystonia that can be accompanied by chorea and/or ataxia. Over time some affected individuals require assistive devices for mobility. Speech fluency and intelligibility are progressively impaired due to dysarthria. Optic atrophy typically develops between ages four and 12 years and manifests as reduced visual acuity, which can include functional blindness (also known as legal blindness) in adulthood. Because only 13 affected individuals are known to the authors, and because nearly half of them were diagnosed retrospectively as adults, the natural history of disease progression and other aspects of the phenotype have not yet been completely defined. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MECR-related neurologic disorder is established in a proband with a childhood-onset movement disorder and biallelic (compound heterozygous or homozygous) pathogenic variants in MECR identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Visual aids for decreased visual acuity due to optic atrophy; occupational therapy and physical therapy to maintain range of movement and special aids (e.g., braces, walkers, wheelchairs) to maintain/improve mobility; speech therapy for dysarthria and augmentative communication if needed. Medications that may relieve dystonia include anticholinergic agents, baclofen, and benzodiazepines. Surveillance: The following yearly examinations are warranted: ophthalmologic (need for additional visual aids), neurologic (need for medications to relieve dystonia), speech therapy (need for augmentative communication), cognitive evaluation, and feeding evaluation (assess risk of aspiration). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Stress and febrile illness as much as possible as these are presumed to exacerbate disease progression. Discuss anesthetic risks with a patient's medical team prior to surgical procedures. Genetic counseling MECR-related neurologic disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the MECR pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

      "title": "A Review of Scales to Evaluate Sleep Disturbances in Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "Patients with movement disorders have a high prevalence of sleep disturbances that can be classified as 1) nocturnal sleep symptoms, such as insomnia, nocturia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), periodic limb movements (PLM), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and REM sleep behaviour disorder; and 2) diurnal problems that include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and sleep attacks. The objective of this review is to provide a practical overview of the most relevant scales that assess these disturbances in order to guide the choice of the most useful instrument/s depending on the line of research or clinical focus. For each scale, the reader will find a brief description of practicalities and psychometric properties, use in movement disorder cohorts and analysed strengths and limitations. To assess insomnia, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a generic scale, and three disease-specific scales: the Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), the PDSS-2, and Scales for outcomes in PD-Sleep-Nocturnal Sleep subscale are discussed. To evaluate nocturia there are no specific tools, but some extensively validated generic urinary symptom scales (the Overall Bladder Questionnaire and the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score) and some PD specific scales that include a nocturia item are available. To measure RLS severity, there are currently four domain specific generic scales: The International Restless Legs Scale, the Johns Hopkins Restless Legs Severity Scale, the RLS-6 measure, a Paediatric RLS Severity Scale, the Augmentation Severity Rating Scale (a scale to evaluate augmentation under treatment) and several instruments that assess impact on quality of sleep and health related quality of life. To evaluate the presence of PLM, no clinical scales have been developed to date. As far as OSA, commonly used instruments such as the Sleep Apnea Scale of the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire, the STOP-Bang questionnaire and the Berlin Questionnaire are reviewed. Three scales have been extensively used to assess EDS: the generic Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and the PD specific Scales for outcomes in PD-Sleep-Daytime sleepiness subscale. To date, only the Inappropriate Sleep Composite Score (ISCS) specifically evaluates propensity to sleep attacks.",

Animals may be pareidolically recognized in neuroimages according to the presence of specific diseases. By associating a given radiological aspect with an animal, doctors improve their diagnostic skills and reinforce mnemonic strategies in radiology practice. The most important pareidolical perceptions of animals in neuroimaging are the hummingbird sign in progressive supranuclear palsy, the panda sign in Wilson's disease, the panda sign in sarcoidosis, the butterfly sign in glioblastomas, the butterfly sign in progressive scoliosis and horizontal gaze palsy, the elephant sign in Alzheimer's disease and the eye-of-the-tiger sign in pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegenerative disease.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a sleep disturbance that commonly occurs in Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Retrospective examination of DLB course has shown that RBD and cognitive decline may precede the onset of parkinsonism and visual hallucinations. Therefore, some patients with DLB may initially present with dementia and RBD, but would not meet current formal criteria for probable DLB at that time. The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with dementia and RBD, who do not have parkinsonism or visual hallucinations, have cognitive profiles that can be distinguished from autopsy-confirmed definite AD, but not from clinically probable DLB. If so, this would support the hypothesis that the presence of RBD and dementia, as the only presenting symptoms, reflects the early manifestation of DLB. Results show that early dementia in probable DLB and dementia with RBD are neuropsychologically indistinguishable. Both groups differ from definite AD of a similar early stage with significantly worse visual perceptual organization, sequencing and letter fluency but significantly better confrontation naming and verbal memory. In addition, follow-up data from a subset of patients with dementia and RBD reveal the subsequent development of parkinsonism or hallucinations 1 to 6 years later. Results indicate that the presentation of dementia and RBD is suggestive of underlying Lewy body disease and not Alzheimer's disease. This provides further evidence in support of including RBD as one of the core diagnostic features of DLB. ( JINS , 2002, 8 , 907–914.)",

However, higher levels of deep sleep and/or lower levels of light sleep have been reported in several all-night polysomnography studies in CFS patients. This distribution of Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (NREMS) contrasts with what would be expected if sleep was interrupted by microawakenings, such as in sleep apneas or periodic limb movements, where more light sleep and less deep sleep are commonly observed. This \"paradoxical\" distribution of NREMS could represent a characteristic feature of chronic fatigue and deserved to be investigated.Methods: A retrospective comparison of the NREMS distribution was performed between 28 \"pure\" Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients (without primary sleep or psychiatric disorders), 27 Apneic-Hypopneic patients and 27 Healthy Controls.Results: Data showed CFS patients to have a higher stage 4/stage 2 or stage 4/light sleep ratios than the other two conditions.Conclusion: This sleep pattern is closer to what is observed in cases of infections than to what is seen after sleep fragmentation by primary sleep or in psychiatric disorders. Such a particular sleep pattern could provide insights into the pathophysiology of fatigue.",

The locked-in syndrome is characterised by preservation of consciousness with dissociation between automatic and volitional control of lower cranial nerve and limb function. Minimally conscious state is characterised by inconsistent but reproducible responses above the level of spontaneous or reflex behaviour, which indicates some degree of interaction with surroundings. Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome is characterised by complete absence of behavioural evidence for self or environmental awareness.

PD with dementia (PDD) is defined as onset of dementia more than 1 year after the onset of parkinsonism. If dementia precedes or occurs less than 1 year after the onset of parkinsonism, a diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is made. There is essentially no difference in the pathology of PDD and DLB at autopsy, indicating that Braak's hypothesis, which is extracted from PD/PDD and excluding DLB, may be bias. REM-related behavioral disorder (RBD) or depression, the main locus of which is the brain stem, could precede or occur after the onset of PD or DLB, indicating a descending and ascending path of Lewy body (LB) pathology. A disturbance in olfaction usually precedes the onset of PD. Recent data indicate that severe olfactory dysfunction in PD is an indication of a high probability of mental decline. These clinical observations and our pathological reports support the presence of an olfactory-amygdala extension path of LB pathology in addition to Braak's hypothesis. Our pathological studies of consecutive autopsy cases showed that the involvement of autonomic ganglia was more frequent than that of the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that initial the stage of LB pathology in Braak's hypothesis should be modified.",

Sleep/wake disorders in autoimmune encephalitis vary and include severe sleeplessness, hypersomnia, central and/or obstructive sleep apnea, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, indeterminate sleep/wake states, and loss of circadian sleep/wake rhythms. N-methyl- d aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDAR) is often associated with insomnia, then hypersomnia and sleep-related central hypoventilation. Profound sleeplessness and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are seen in patients with voltage-gated potassium channel-complex antibodies. Fragmented sleep and hypersomnia are common in paraneoplastic syndromes associated with anti-MA protein encephalitis; rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in those with antibodies against leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein (LGI1) or contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2) antibodies. Antibodies against a cell adhesion protein IGLON5 may result in obstructive sleep apnea, inspiratory stridor, disorganized nonrapid eye movement sleep, and excessive movements and parasomnias fragmenting nonrapid and rapid eye movement sleep. Recognizing a particular sleep/wake disorder is often a presenting or prominent feature in certain autoimmune encephalitis permit for earlier diagnosis.

A neuropsychologic battery designed to investigate these hypotheses was administered to 33 rigorously diagnosed autistic individuals with IQ scores greater than 80, and 33 individually matched normal controls. Stepwise discriminant function was used to define the profile of neuropsychologic functioning across domains. The neuropsychologic profile in these autistic individuals was defined by impairments in skilled motor, complex memory, complex language, and reasoning domains, and by intact or superior performance in the attention, simple memory, simple language, and visual-spatial domains. This profile is not consistent with mental retardation or with a general deficit syndrome, but rather with a selective impairment in complex information processing that does not involve visual-spatial processing. This profile is not consistent with a single primary deficit, but with a multiple primary deficit model in which the deficit pattern within and across domains is reflective of the complexity of the information processing demands. This neuropsychologic profile is furthermore consistent with the neurophysiologic characterization of autism as a late information processing disorder with sparing of early information processing.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is an episodic, potentially life-long, disabling disorder that can be difficult to diagnose. Need to improve recognition, reduce sub-optimal care and improve long-term outcomes. There is variation in management of care across healthcare settings. Characteristics of a Manic Episode: A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood. During the period of mood disturbance, at least three of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable) and have been persistent to a significant degree.1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 2. Decreased need for sleep. 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 5. Distractability, i.e. attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli. 6. Increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation. 7. Excessive involvement in pleasurable activities which have a high potential for painful consequences, e.g. unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments. Mood disturbance sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in occupational functioning or in usual social activities or relations with others, or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others. At no time during the disturbance have there been delusions or hallucinations for as long as two weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms. Not superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophrenic form disorder, or delusional disorder or psychotic disorder. The disturbance is not due to the physiologic effects of a substance or general medical disorder.",

      "title": "Neurophysiology of the “Celiac Brain”: Disentangling Gut-Brain Connections",
      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) can be considered a complex multi-organ disorder with highly variable extra-intestinal, including neurological, involvement. Cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, headache, cognitive impairment, and neuropsychiatric diseases are complications frequently reported. These manifestations may be present at the onset of the typical disease or become clinically evident during its course. However, CD subjects with subclinical neurological involvement have also been described, as well as patients with clear central and/or peripheral nervous system and intestinal histopathological disease features in the absence of typical CD manifestations. Based on these considerations, a sensitive and specific diagnostic method that is able to detect early disease process, progression, and complications is desirable. In this context, neurophysiological techniques play a crucial role in the non-invasive assessment of central nervous system excitability and conductivity. Moreover, some of these tools are known for their valuable role in early diagnosis and follow-up of several neurological diseases or systemic disorders such as CD with nervous system involvement, even at the subclinical level. This review provides an up-to-date summary of the neurophysiological basis of CD using electroencephalography, multimodal evoked potentials, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The evidence examined here seems to converge on an overall profile of \"hyperexcitable celiac brain\", which partially recovers after institution of a gluten-free diet. The main translational correlate is that in case of subclinical neurological involvement or overt unexplained symptoms, neurophysiology could contribute to the diagnosis, assessment, and monitoring of a potentially underlying CD.",

Sleep may be disturbed by the aging process, age-related medical conditions or psychiatric conditions. There are two common sleep disorders in this population: obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and restless legs syndrome. Obesity or anatomic changes with aging affecting the upper airway may cause obstructive sleep apneas, which are associated with the development of cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric disorders. Symptoms of restless legs are also prevalent in the elderly, resulting in sleep-onset insomnia or frequent nocturnal awakenings. Since sleep pathology can negatively impact cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric functions, assessment and treatment of the underlying sleep disorders may positively impact a patient's health and quality of life.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

The essential pathologic feature is the Lewy body, a neuronal inclusion containing α-synuclein, found in brainstem nuclei and the neocortex. Clinical features include early fluctuations in attention, hallucinations, and parkinsonism, with progression to a combined cortical and subcortical dementia. To distinguish it from Parkinson disease dementia, a time course of one year from cognitive changes to motor feature onset has been established. There is more severe impairment of verbal fluency, executive function, and visuospatial abilities in DLB patients. Both rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and neuroleptic sensitivity are notable in this patient group. Treatment is aimed at symptom management. Cholinesterase inhibitors can be beneficial for behavioral and cognitive issues, whereas dopaminergic agents may help motor symptoms. Survival is equivalent to AD when measured from symptom onset, though diagnosis in DLB may be delayed.",

      "title": "1451 Long-Standing Hallucinations, a Rare Presentation of Lewy Body Dementia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonian features. While visual hallucinations are common in LBD, their early and prolonged presentation without significant cognitive decline is rare. This case report describes a patient with a 13-year history of visual hallucinations preceding the diagnosis of LBD, highlighting the importance of recognizing atypical presentations of this condition. Report of case A 79-year-old female presented with a 13-year history of complex, well-formed visual hallucinations with preserved insight. The hallucinations occurred during sleep transitions and when her eyes were closed, consisting of scary animals and recreated daily events. She experienced 4-5 episodes per week without auditory components or delusions. The patient’s medical history included autoimmune hemolytic anemia, giant cell arteritis, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, insomnia, and anxiety. Neurological examination revealed axial and upper limb rigidity, more pronounced on the right side, mild postural and action tremor in both upper extremities, and gait abnormalities. Cognitive assessment showed mild impairment (MoCA 23/30) with deficits in visuospatial/executive function, naming, attention, and delayed recall. Diagnostic workup included normal visual examination, polysomnography ruling out REM sleep behavior disorder, and normal EEG.Brain MRI showed mild chronic microvascular ischemic disease and a left sphenoid meningioma. FDG-PET revealed hypometabolism in bilateral temporal, lateral occipital, mesial frontal lobes, and cerebellar hemispheres, aligning with findings in DLB and supporting the diagnosis. DaT scan showed normal uptake. Autonomic testing demonstrated moderate abnormal sweating in hands and feet, decreased Valsalva ratio, and labile blood pressure. UPSIT score indicated moderate microsmia. Conclusion This case highlights the importance of considering LBD in patients with long-standing visual hallucinations, even in the absence of significant cognitive decline or typical parkinsonian features. The prolonged prodromal period with predominantly psychiatric symptoms underscores the need for comprehensive evaluation and long-term follow-up in elderly patients presenting with visual hallucinations. The combination of visual hallucinations, mild cognitive impairment, subtle parkinsonian signs, autonomic dysfunction, and specific FDG-PET findings supports the diagnosis of LBD. This case emphasizes the heterogeneity of LBD presentations and the potential for extended periods of isolated psychiatric symptoms before the emergence of more classical features. Support (if any)",

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have soft signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

      "abstract": "The sleep patterns of two groups of children with autism, one with moderate to severe intellectual handicap, and one with mild handicap to normal IQ level, were compared with those of children without autism. Parents completed 14 day sleep diaries and questionnaires. ILesults suggested that at some stage during childhood, particularly under 8 years of age, the majority of children with autism will experience sleep problems. These problems are likely to be severe in many cases and will generally include one or more of. extreme sleep latencies; lengthy periods of night waking; shortened night sleep; and early morning waking. Such problems may have some specificity for autism as they appear to be rare in non-handicapped children and in children with mild degrees of intellectual handicap. It is likely that sleep problems in early childhood are related to the severe social difl:culties present in autism and the consequent inability of these children to use social cues to synchronise their sleep/wake cycle. Continued sleep dilticulties at older ages and with higher IQ may also be related to arousal and anxiety factors.",

This study describes another interesting psychiatric symptom, which seems to be characteristic of DLB, in many patients who visited the author's psychogeriatrics department for neurocognitive disorders or psychogeriatric diseases. Methods The clinical courses of seven representative cases of DLB, each of which included episodes of this interesting psychiatric symptom, are described to clarify the commonalities they shared. Results After examining the characteristic symptoms of these cases, a novel term was proposed for a new concept in psychiatric phenomenology, the “Yume‐Utsutsu” (dreamy or half‐asleep) phenomenon. “Yume‐Utsutsu” is a Japanese word that means a mental state in which dreams are indistinguishable from reality. This phenomenon is different from visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, rapid eye sleep movement behavior disorder, delirium, and epilepsy‐related automatism. Conclusions The “Yume‐Utsutsu” (dreamy or half‐asleep) phenomenon proposed as a novel psychiatric concept in this article is useful for diagnosing and clarifying the psychopathology of DLB.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT It is estimated that 45% of individuals with cognitive impairment experience sleep disturbances prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms. Assessing sleeping problems and enhancing sleep quality are critical first steps to reduce the risk of cognitive impairment. Objective: To review existing literature based on predefined eligibility criteria to understand the connection between sleep disturbance and Alzheimer's disease. Methods: A thorough and systematic evaluation of numerous studies was carried out to assess one or more of the following epidemiological factors: (1) sleep disorders, (2) cognitive impairment, and (3) risk estimates for cognitive impairment due to sleep. Results: Studies suggest that individuals who experience memory loss may encounter sleep disturbances before noticing other symptoms. Numerous sleep disorders, such as excessive and inadequate sleep duration, poor sleep quality, circadian rhythm abnormalities, insomnia, and obstructive sleep apnea were found to increase the risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Additionally, lower sleep quality and shorter sleep duration have been linked to higher cerebral-β-amyloid levels. Objective evidence for the development of cognitive impairment is provided by the architecture of sleep stages. Patients experiencing sleep problems may benefit from specific types of sleep medicine as a preventative measure against cognitive decline. Conclusion: Sleep disorders can have adverse effects on cognitive health. The duration and quality of sleep are fundamental factors for maintaining a healthy brain as we age. Proper sleep can aid prevent cognitive impairment, particularly Alzheimer's disease and dementia.",

      "abstract": "Central Nervous System Manifestations in Rheumatic Diseases Patients with multi-system rheumatic conditions may have a disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Central nervous system manifestations vary according to the location of the lesion and range from focal findings (e.g., stroke-like presentations), although serious neurological complications in rheumatic disease appear to be rare. The most prominent features of neurological involvement in rheumatic diseases include cerebral ischaemia and psychiatric symptoms. Little information is available on the prevalence of neurological disease in patients with a rheumatological diagnosis. Involvement of the CNS may be a striking early or presenting feature with a wide variety of manifestations. There is more clarity about the CNS syndromes attributable to systemic lupus erythematosus and new insights into the central mechanisms involved in the manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. Severe CNS involvement is associated with poor prognosis, and high mortality rate. We review the spectrum of neurological diseases in patients with a rheumatological diagnosis.",

      "title": "Dementia with Lewy bodies.",
      "abstract": "The presence of a high number of Lewy bodies--the morphological marker of Parkinson's disease--in the cerebral cortex of some cases of dementia has been frequently observed in association to Alzheimer type lesions (mainly senile plaques) and changes in the substantia nigra, that may be held responsible for the frequently associated symptoms of parkinsonism. The term \"dementia with Lewy body\" (DLB) has recently been suggested by a consensus conference and indicates that the pathogenetic mechanism of the dementia remains poorly understood. Marked fluctuations of alertness and of the cognitive performances, moderate parkinsonism and episodes of visual hallucinations may lead to suspect this diagnosis in cases of dementia. Unexplained falls, syncopes, delirium or alterations of consciousness may also be observed, and the patients may then be admitted in departments of internal medicine or geriatrics. The Lewy body is an intraneuronal spherical inclusion, present in Parkinson's disease. It is observed in the brainstem (substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, dorsal nucleus of the Xth nerve) and in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The cortical Lewy bodies have a different aspect, but retain their antigenic characteristics: they are, in particular, stained by the antiubiquitin antibodies. Recently, they were found to be also labeled by antisynuclein antibodies. A mutation of the synuclein gene was recently identified in cases of familial Parkinson's disease. Clinically as well as pathologically, DLB may thus be difficult to distinguish from Alzheimer's disease on the one hand, and from Parkinson's disease, on the other. That diagnosis, however, is associated with a poor prognosis and should lead to specific therapeutic measures.",

      "title": "Approach to neurometabolic diseases from a pediatric neurological point of view.",
      "abstract": "Objective Neurometabolic disorders are an important group of diseases that mostly are presented in newborns and infants. Neurological manifestations are the prominent signs and symptoms in this group of diseases. Seizures are a common sign and are often refractory to antiepileptic drugs in untreated neurometabolic patients. The onset of symptoms for neurometabolic disorders appears after an interval of normal or near normal growth and development.Additionally, affected children may fare well until a catabolic crisis occurs. Patients with neurometabolic disorders during metabolic decompensation have severe clinical presentation, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This symptom is often fatal but severe neurological insult and regression in neurodevelopmental milestones can result as a prominent sign in patients who survived. Acute symptoms should be immediately treated regardless of the cause. A number of patients with neurometabolic disorders respond favorably and, in some instances, dramatically respond to treatment. Early detection and early intervention is invaluable in some patients to prevent catabolism and normal or near normal neurodevelopmental milestones. This paper discusses neurometabolic disorders, approaches to this group of diseases (from the view of a pediatric neurologist), clinical and neurological manifestations, neuroimaging and electroencephalography findings, early detection, and early treatment.",

      "abstract": "Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are central features of many movement disorders, exacerbating motor and non-motor symptoms and impairing quality of life. Understanding these disturbances to sleep is clinically important and may further our understanding of the underlying movement disorder. This review evaluates the current anatomical and neurochemical understanding of normal sleep and the recognised primary sleep disorders. In addition, we undertook a systematic review of the evidence for disruption to sleep across multiple movement disorders. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder has emerged as the most reliable prodromal biomarker for the alpha synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, often preceding motor symptom onset by several years. Abnormal sleep has also been described for many other movement disorders, but further evidence is needed to determine whether this is a primary or secondary phenotypic component of the underlying condition. Medication used in the treatment of motor symptoms also affects sleep and can aggravate or cause certain sleep disorders. Within the context of movement disorders, there is also some suggestion of a shared underlying mechanism for motor and sleep pathophysiology, with evidence implicating thalamic and brainstem structures and monoaminergic neurotransmission. This review highlights the need for an understanding of normal and abnormal sleep within the movement disorder clinic, an ability to screen for specific causes of poor sleep and to treat sleep disturbance to improve quality of life. Key sleep disorders also act as important biomarkers and have implications in diagnosis, prognosis and the development of future therapies.",

      "abstract": "Lewy body dementia and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease are recognized on the basis of certain diagnostic criteria. However, common symptoms such as: dementia, extrapyramidal syndrome, psychotic disorders may cause difficulty to make the correct diagnosis especially in the early stage of the disease. Each of these diseases may have atypical onset. The further course and the appearance of other symptoms indicate a proper diagnosis. Electroencephalogram and examination of 14-3-3 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid are helpful in the differential diagnosis. We present a case of a 66-year-old patient initially suspected of Lewy body dementia. On admission, psychomotor retardation, dysarthria, upper extremities dysmetria, extrapyramidal tension in the upper limbs, lower extremities ataxia, slow gait and unstable Romberg test were present. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 24/30. On neuropsychological assessment early stage of dementia was diagnosed. Anxiety-depressive symptoms were observed with periodic visual-auditory components. After less than 3 weeks there was a deterioration of neurological state. Dysarthria and lower limbs ataxia were increased, ataxia of the trunk appeared and psychomotor retardation got worse. There was significant progression of cognitive impairment, therefore complete neuropsychological examination was impossible to perform. MMSE score was 12/30 (12 points less than three months earlier). The course of the disease and additional tests results confirmed the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.",

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

The main difference is the temporal sequence of symptoms; extrapyramidal symptoms precede dementia in PDD whereas they coincide with or follow dementia in DLB. The cognitive profile is characterized by particularly severe deficits in executive, visuospatial functions and attention. Prominent memory impairments may be absent in the early stages but usually appear as the disease progresses. Visual hallucinations and delusions are the most common psychiatric symptoms and are seen in most patients. The main biochemical deficit associated with these diseases is impairment in cholinergic markers; deficits in other neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin are also found. Placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials with cholinesterase inhibitors rivastigmine and donepezil have shown modest but significant clinical benefits in PDD and to some extent in DLB.",

Vertigo can be thought of as a subjective disturbance of the integration of different sensory inputs. The history and subjective characterisation of vertigo often provide enough information for initial differential diagnosis and recommendation for a specific evaluation. The evaluation includes simple tests of posture and gait, tests of ocular motility, and examination of nystagmus. Instability and nystagmus towards a specific direction point to a vestibular disorder, especially if the nystagmus is suppressed by optical fixation. The most common causes of a vestibular disorder are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a sudden vestibular loss (or vestibular neuritis), and Ménière's disease. These three diseases are discussed briefly.",

      "abstract": "Joubert syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia, hypotonia, developmental delay, abnormal respiratory patterns, and abnormal eye movements. The biochemical and genetic basis of Joubert syndrome is unknown and a specific chromosomal locus for this disorder has not been identified. Review of this disorder and related syndromes suggests that (1) hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis in Joubert syndrome is frequently associated with a complex brain stem malformation represented as the \"molar tooth sign\" on magnetic resonance imaging, (2) the \"molar tooth sign\" could be present in association with the Dandy-Walker malformation and occipital encephalocele, (3) cerebellar hypoplasia is present in conditions related to Joubert syndrome such as Arima syndrome; Senior-Loken syndrome; cerebellar vermian hypoplasia, oligophrenia, congenital ataxia, coloboma, and hepatic fibrosis syndrome; and juvenile nephronophthisis due to NPH1 mutations, and (4) the brainstem-vermis malformation spectrum is probably caused by at least two and probably several genetic loci. We have ascertained previously a cohort of 50 patients with a putative diagnosis of Joubert syndrome in order to evaluate the presence of associated malformations, and to initiate studies leading to the identification of genes causing Joubert and related syndromes. Among the associated malformations found in patients ascertained as having Joubert syndrome, 8% of patients had polydactyly, 4% had ocular colobomas, 2% had renal cysts, and 2% had soft-tissue tumors of the tongue. The WNT1 gene has been tested as a candidate gene for Joubert syndrome based on its expression in the developing cerebellum and an associated mutation in the swaying mouse. A search for mutations in WNT1 in a series of patients with Joubert syndrome did not detect mutations at this locus. This analysis suggested that mutations in WNT1 might not have a significant role in Joubert syndrome, and other functional candidate genes related to development of the cerebellum need to be examined. A genome-wide linkage analysis carried out in 10 Joubert syndrome pedigrees did not identify a specific chromosomal locus for this disorder. This observation, along with those from clinical studies, provides further evidence that Joubert and related syndromes are genetically heterogeneous. ( J Child Neurol 1999;14:660-666).",

      "title": "Differentiating Prodromal Dementia with Lewy Bodies from Prodromal Alzheimer’s Disease: A Pragmatic Review for Clinicians",
      "abstract": "This pragmatic review synthesises the current understanding of prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies (pDLB) and prodromal Alzheimer's disease (pAD), including clinical presentations, neuropsychological profiles, neuropsychiatric symptoms, biomarkers, and indications for disease management. The core clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)—parkinsonism, complex visual hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations, and REM sleep behaviour disorder are common prodromal symptoms. Supportive clinical features of pDLB include severe neuroleptic sensitivity, as well as autonomic and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The neuropsychological profile in mild cognitive impairment attributable to Lewy body pathology (MCI-LB) tends to include impairment in visuospatial skills and executive functioning, distinguishing it from MCI due to AD, which typically presents with impairment in memory. pDLB may present with cognitive impairment, psychiatric symptoms, and/or recurrent episodes of delirium, indicating that it is not necessarily synonymous with MCI-LB. Imaging, fluid and other biomarkers may play a crucial role in differentiating pDLB from pAD. The current MCI-LB criteria recognise low dopamine transporter uptake using positron emission tomography or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), loss of REM atonia on polysomnography, and sympathetic cardiac denervation using meta-iodobenzylguanidine SPECT as indicative biomarkers with slowing of dominant frequency on EEG among others as supportive biomarkers. This review also highlights the emergence of fluid and skin-based biomarkers. There is little research evidence for the treatment of pDLB, but pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for DLB may be discussed with patients. Non-pharmacological interventions such as diet, exercise, and cognitive stimulation may provide benefit, while evaluation and management of contributing factors like medications and sleep disturbances are vital. There is a need to expand research across diverse patient populations to address existing disparities in clinical trial participation. In conclusion, an early and accurate diagnosis of pDLB or pAD presents an opportunity for tailored interventions, improved healthcare outcomes, and enhanced quality of life for patients and care partners.",

      "abstract": "Introduccion y desarrollo. Los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y las epilepsias comparten etiologias y patologias comunes. La gravedad del deterioro y la variedad de sintomas asociados a los trastornos del neurodesarrollo o a sindromes epilepticos especificos reflejan disfunciones focales o globales, estructurales o funcionales de las redes neuronales. La compleja relacion entre los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y la epilepsia es de menor importancia que los factores comunes que incluyen la genetica, la cognicion, la funcion motora y del lenguaje. Las encefalopatias epilepticas estan asociadas a una regresion o una ralentizacion del funcionamiento cognitivo, del lenguaje o de la conducta, y la hipotesis de trabajo aceptada es que esta es una consecuencia directa de las crisis o de la actividad epileptiforme interictal, y no de la enfermedad asociada. Los datos que apoyan la idea de que las crisis recurrentes o la actividad electrica anomala pueden provocar alteraciones especificas cognitivas, del lenguaje o de la conducta, incluso en las encefalopatias epilepticas aceptadas, todavia son objeto de debate. Los datos procedentes de los estudios en animales y la experiencia clinica de las encefalopatias epilepticas de la juventud dan a entender que hay ventanas temporales del desarrollo que son cruciales para el tipo de sindrome epileptico y para el desenlace conductual y cognitivo. Conclusion. El tratamiento de los ninos en los que coexiste un trastorno del neurodesarrollo con la epilepsia es un problema dificil que requiere un planteamiento multidisciplinario que aborde tanto la epilepsia como el problema especifico cognitivo o conductual y que se adapte a las necesidades de cada nino.",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is characterized by dream-enacting behaviour and impaired motor inhibition during rapid eye movement sleep. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is commonly associated with neurodegenerative disorders, but also reported in narcolepsy with cataplexy. Most narcolepsy with cataplexy patients lack the sleep–wake, and rapid eye movement sleep, motor-regulating hypocretin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. In contrast, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and hypocretin deficiency are rare in narcolepsy without cataplexy. We hypothesized that rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder coexists with cataplexy in narcolepsy due to hypocretin deficiency. In our study, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder was diagnosed by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (2nd edition) criteria in 63 narcolepsy patients with or without cataplexy. Main outcome measures were: rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder symptoms; short and long muscle activations per hour rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep; and periodic and non-periodic limb movements per hour rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep. Outcome variables were analysed in relation to cataplexy and hypocretin deficiency with uni- and multivariate logistic/linear regression models, controlling for possible rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder biasing factors (age, gender, disease duration, previous anti-cataplexy medication). Only hypocretin deficiency independently predicted rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder symptoms (relative risk = 3.69, P = 0.03), long muscle activations per hour rapid eye movement sleep (ln-coefficient = 0.81, P < 0.01), and short muscle activations per hour rapid eye movement sleep (ln-coefficient = 1.01, P < 0.01). Likewise, periodic limb movements per hour rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep were only associated with hypocretin deficiency (P < 0.01). A significant association between hypocretin deficiency and cataplexy was confirmed (P < 0.01). In a sub-analysis, hypocretin deficiency suggested the association of periodic limb movements and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder outcomes (symptoms, non-periodic short and long muscle activity) in rapid eye movement sleep. Our results support the hypothesis that hypocretin deficiency is independently associated with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder in narcolepsy. Thus, hypocretin deficiency is linked to the two major disturbances of rapid eye movement sleep motor regulation in narcolepsy: rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and cataplexy. Hypocretin deficiency is also significantly associated with periodic limb movements in rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep, and provides a possible pathophysiological link between rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and periodic limb movements in narcolepsy. The study supports the hypothesis that an impaired hypocretin system causes a general instability of motor regulation during wakefulness, rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep in human narcolepsy.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

      "abstract": "Purpose To identify etiologies and developmental comorbidity in children with congenital or very early blindness. Methods Children with congenital or early blindness in Sweden during a 20 year period were identified through registers. Major causes for the blindness and developmental disturbance were collected from patient records. Results Four causes of blindness amounted to 65% of all etiologies: retinopathy of prematurity, optic nerve hypoplasia, Leber congenital amaurosis, and optic nerve atrophy, in falling order of frequency. Nearly three out of four children had at least one additional impairment besides blindness; the most common being intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. More than half of the population had more than one additional impairment. Conclusions Blindness in itself entails considerable implications for a child's development and learning. When blindness is combined with other developmental disorders, there is a significant need for support and adaptation. It is important to understand the developmental effects of both the blindness and other coexisting disabilities in order to correctly interpret the behavior and needs of the children.",

      "title": "Mania Associated with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition in the brain. A 29-year-old housewife with secondary mania related to multiple sclerosis is described. The case highlights the importance of considering organic causes in treating patients with mania, especially when there are unexplained neurological findings and cognitive dysfunction. The case also illustrates the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging for investigating organic causes of secondary mania and psychosis. Key words: Bipolar disorder, Case report, Diagnosis, Magnetic resonance imaging, Multiple sclerosis Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode according to DSM-IV requires a distinct period of persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting at least 4 days, with at least 3 associated symptoms, such as inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition. Very often, the florid psychopathology can obscure subtle neurological/physical signs and symptoms, and make the diagnosis of the underlying organic conditions difficult. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a particularly devastating disease of the central nervous system (CNS); a patient's presenting symptoms and the temporal evolution of the clinical findings may suggest the correct diagnosis. In relapsing-remitting MS--the type present in 80% of patients--symptoms and signs typically evolve over a period of several days, stabilise, and then often improve, spontaneously or with treatment, within weeks. Relapsing-remitting MS has a peak age of onset of 20 to 40 years and has a female predominance of approximately 2:1. This type of MS typically starts with sensory disturbances, unilateral optic neuritis, diplopia, limb weakness, clumsiness, gait apraxia, and neurogenic bladder and bowel symptoms. Twenty percent of affected patients have primary progressive MS, while others may develop persistent neurological signs after relapse and the disease may progress between relapses (secondary progressive MS). Prominent cortical signs (aphasia, apraxia, recurrent seizures, visual field loss, and early dementia) and extrapyramidal phenomena (chorea and rigidity) only rarely dominate the clinical picture. Eventually, cognitive impairment, depression, emotional lability, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, progressive quadriparesis, and other CNS manifestations become troublesome. The diagnosis is based on established clinical, and when necessary, laboratory criteria. The most widely used diagnostic criteria are Poser's criteria. (1) Very recently, a new criterion developed by McDonald has been found to enable earlier diagnosis in a group of patients with one demyelinating syndrome. (2) It may become widely used in the near future. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), findings of multifocal lesions of various ages, especially those involving the periventricular white matter, brain stem, cerebellum, and the spinal cord white matter, support the clinical impression. The presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI indicates current sites of presumed inflammatory demyelination (active lesions). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis often shows increased intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins of restricted specificity, oligoclonal bands may be present, or the synthesis of immunogobulin G (IgG) may be increased. Physiological evidence of subclinical dysfunction of optic nerves and spinal cord (changes in visual evoked responses and somatosensory evoked potentials) may further support the diagnosis. A case of a 29-year-old married woman with secondary hypomanic features associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) is presented, along with a review of the subject. …",

Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of BCL11A-ID is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in BCL11A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is primarily supportive and dictated by symptoms. Standard antiepileptic medication for seizure disorder; standard treatment for abnormal vision and/or strabismus, sleep disturbance, scoliosis, joint laxity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), constipation, and developmental issues. Surveillance: Assessment of growth parameters, feeding difficulties, GERD, constipation, scoliosis, developmental progress, and behavior at each visit. Monitor seizures as clinically indicated. Assessment of vision and eye alignment as needed. Genetic counseling BCL11A-ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, most affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo BCL11A pathogenic variant.

Cognitive enhancers can improve intellectual function and have been approved for Alzheimer’s dementia, dementia of Parkinson’s disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Cognitive enhancers are being developed for other cognitive disorders. There are many advantages for development of symptomatic cognitive enhancers compared to disease-modifying agents. Cognitive enhancers typically modulate transmitter systems. Cross-disease phenotypes such as executive function impairment may represent a development strategy for cognitive enhancing agents. Life cycle management strategies for cognitive enhancers include expanding indications to disorders with related pathophysiology or to different stages of disease severity and development of alternate formulations. Cognitive enhancers can restore essential cognitive capability and are a critical element of optimal care of patients with neurologic and psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

Five underwent detailed evaluation because of an hallucination, 4 for visual loss, and 3 for both. Hallucinations were either unformed (for example, bright lights, straight lines) or highly formed (for example, faces), in which case they were invariably recognized by the patient as inappropriate. In no instance did they occur in association with delirium, confusion, or use of hallucinogenic drugs. Patients with loss of vision had scotomas, homonymous field defects, and cortical blindness. These features indicate disease in the posterior cerebral artery circulation, a localization often supported by ancillary neurologic findings, for example, vocal cord paralysis, diminished gag reflex. Thus, various visual dysfunctions may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus due to cerebral vasculitis. At times they may be the most prominent and disabling feature of the disorder.",

In cerebellar ataxia, the cerebellum and/or the pathways connecting the cerebellum with other parts of the nervous system undergo progressive, premature neuronal death and atrophy. The result is a heterogeneous spectrum of motor abnormalities that manifests as an abnormal broad-based gait, incoordination, tremor, dysarthria, and motor and autonomic dysfunction. Some studies have found that urinary dysfunction in patients with genetically defined causes of spinocerebellar ataxia was very rare. Urodynamic abnormality, either an overactive, underactive detrusor, or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, was identified in 87% of patients, and 61% of them had Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome-related neurologic problems. Neurocutaneous syndromes encompass a number of hereditary conditions involving nervous system, eyeball, retina, and skin. They present in childhood and slowly progress through adolescence. Incontinence is the most reported lower urinary tract symptoms in epilepsy, followed by urgency, frequency, retention, and hesitancy.",

      "abstract": "Background: Leigh disease[1], also termed as Sub Acute Necrotising Encephalopathy (SNP) is a rare, inheritable, progressive neurodegenerative disorder with characteristic pathological features usually presenting in infancy or early childhood. It was first reported in 1951 by Denis Leigh[2], a British neuro pathologist, in a 7 month old infant that progressed rapidly and resulted in death over a 6 week period. Clinically, Leigh disease is characterized by psychomotor delay or regression, muscular hypotonia, brainstem signs (especially strabismus, nystagmus and swallowing difficulties) & ataxia. In late stages pyramidal signs & respiratory insufficiency occurs. In most cases, dysfunction of the respiratory chain enzymes is responsible for the disease. There are several known genetically determined causes of Leigh disease: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, complex I or II deficiency, complex IV (COX) deficiency, complex V (ATPase) deficiency, and deficiency of coenzyme Q10[1]. These defects may occur sporadically or be inherited by autosomal recessive transmission, as in the case of COX deficiency; by X-linked transmission, as in the case of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α deficiency; or by maternal transmission, as in complex V (ATPase 6 nt 8993 mutation) deficiency. About 30% of cases are due to mutations in mtDNA[1]. Despite its considerable clinical, genetic and biochemistry heterogeneity, the basic neuro pathological features in children affected are almost identical; which are focal, bilateral, and symmetric necrotic lesions associated with demyelination, vascular proliferation and gliosis in the brainstem, diencephalon, basal ganglia, and cerebellum[1]. It is possible to come to a diagnosis of SNE on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, mode of inheritance, metabolic abnormalities, and neuro imaging findings[4]. We report a rare case which presented clinically as a neurodegenerative disorder and diagnosed as Leigh disease on MRI.",

Physiological changes are minimal during moderate sleep loss, but mood changes are clearly noticeable. The most likely sleep problems for aircrew members are those associated with disruption of sleep- wakefulness cycles and partial sleep loss. Consistent performance decrement is difficult to find, but marked increase in fatigue is a common problem. Sleep loss, both total and partial, tends to potentiate the circadian influence on performance and interact with other stressors to enhance the stress-induced physiological responses. Deprivation of sleep stage REM or sleep stage 4 produces no behavioral changes supportive of earlier beliefs that these two stages, especially stage REM, were necessary for effective waking behavior.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia and spasticity with dorsal column dysfunction (decreased position and vibration sense) in most individuals. The neurologic dysfunction involves the legs more than the arms. The tendon reflexes are retained. Deterioration of motor skills usually starts in childhood or adolescence, but occasionally not until adulthood. Dysarthria develops over time. Occasional findings include epilepsy; learning problems; cognitive decline; and reduced consciousness, neurologic deterioration, and fever following minor head trauma. Individuals with neonatal or early-infantile onset have a severe disease course often associated with early death. Those with childhood onset have slow progression with wheelchair dependence in the teens or twenties. Adult onset is associated with slow progression and mild impairment. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of LBSL can be established in a proband with characteristic abnormalities observed on brain and spinal cord MRI using MRI-based criteria. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in DARS2 identified by molecular genetic testing. If molecular results are inconclusive, a functional assay to identify reduced MtAspRS enzyme activity in lymphoblasts can confirm the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive therapy includes: physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function and prevent contractures and scoliosis; and antiepileptic drugs, speech therapy, special education, and social work support as needed. Surveillance: Assess for new neurologic manifestations at each visit; monitor those with seizures as needed; consider brain MRI every few years to monitor progression; monitor developmental progress and educational needs at each visit throughout childhood; assess for family support needs at each visit. Genetic counseling LBSL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a DARS2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the DARS2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

A combination of sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction culminates in loss of joint proprioception and loss of sensation in the joint.2 The loss of pain perception and altered biomechanics ultimately result in joint dissolution. This disorder most commonly affects the weight-bearing joints of the lower limb and, to a lesser extent, the upper extremities and the spine. The neuropathic joint is predisposed to arthrosis, alignment deformities, fractures, and infections.1–3 The location and extent of changes depend on whether the neuropathy is central or peripheral and the degree of loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic function. Various neuropathic conditions have a predilection for specific joints.

      "title": "Sleep Disorders: Disorders of Arousal?",
      "abstract": "In summary, the classical sleep disorders of nocturnal enuresis, somnambulism, the nightmare, and the sleep terror occur preferentially during arousal from slow-wave sleep and are virtually never associated with the rapid-eye-movement dreaming state. Original data are reported here which indicate that physiological differences from normal subjects, of a type predisposing the individual to a particular attack pattern, are present throughout the night. The episode, at least in the case of enuresis, appears to be simply a reinforcement of these differences to a clinically overt level. A number of features are common to all four sleep disorders. These had been shown previously to be attributable to the arousal itself. New data obtained by means of evoked potential techniques suggest that these common symptoms of the confusional period that follows non-REM sleep are related to alterations of cerebral reactivity, at least of the visual system. The symptoms which distinguish the individual attack types (that is, micturition, prolonged confusional fugues, overt terror) appear to be based upon physiological changes present throughout sleep which are markedly accentuated during arousal from slow-wave sleep. These changes may in some way be related to diurnal psychic conflicts. But, to date, it has proved impossible to demonstrate potentially causal psychological activity, dreaming or other forms of mental activity, or even a psychological void in sleep just preceding the attacks. The presence of all-night or even daytime predisposing physiological changes and the difficulty in obtaining any solid evidence of a preceding psychological cause explain, no doubt, why the results of efforts to cure the disorders at the moment of their occurrence (for example, by conditioning procedures in nocturnal enuresis) have been far from satisfactory. I stress the points that the attacks are best considered disorders of arousal and that the slow-wave sleep arousal episode which sets the stage for these attacks is a normal cyclic event. Indeed it is the most intense recurrent arousal that an individual regularly experiences. The most fruitful possibilities for future research would appear to be more detailed studies of those physiological changes that predispose individuals to certain types of attacks when they undergo intense arousal or stress; the reversal of these changes by psychological or pharmacological means; and more refined investigations of the physiological and psychological characteristics of the process of cyclic arousal from non-REM sleep.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the appearance of protein aggregates in neuronal cell bodies composed predominantly of alpha-synuclein, known as Lewy bodies. PD is now recognized as a multisystem disorder characterized by severe motor impairment and various non-motor symptoms. Cognitive decline is one of the most common and worrisome non-motor symptoms. Moderate cognitive impairment (CI), diagnosed already in the early stages of PD, usually leads to deep dementia. The main types of CI observed in PD include executive dysfunction, attention, and memory disfunction, visuospatial decline, and verbal deficits. According to the literature, the following mechanisms play a significant role in the development of cognitive dysfunctions in PD: (1) changes in the conformational structure of synaptic proteins; (2) disruption of synaptic transmission; (3) neuroinflammation (pathological activation of neuroglia); (4) mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress; (5) metabolic conditions; (6) functional remodeling of the neural networks. The listed molecular and synaptic changes in the brain can lead to the death of dopamine-synthesizing cells of the substantia nigra and dysfunction of other mediator systems, as well as partial cellular atrophy in the neocortex and subcortical nuclei. As a result, the functioning of neural networks involved in the transmission of information related to the regulation of motor activity and cognitive functions is disrupted. Elucidation of the causes of changes occurring in PD and the search for methods to eliminate them will help create new approaches in the treatment of this disease. The aim of the review is to analyze the pathological processes in the brain that underlie the onset of cognitive impairment in PD. The review analyzes the data obtained both from studies on patients with PD and animal (rodents and primates) models of this disease used for the evaluation of the mechanisms underlying etiology and the development of PD in humans.",

Since Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome is considered an Alzheimer-like disease in dogs, it was stipulated to document concurrent behavioral and neurological signs in agi ng dogs. Two hundred and forty eight dogs of different age and breeds were included to study neurological disorders. It was found that w ith increase in age, the neuromuscular disorders show progressive increase in severity. Ageing represents a complex biological process characterized by a progressive modification of tissues and cells with a gradual loss of adaptive capacity. Older dogs are susceptible to many of the diseases that affect humans viz. arthritis, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and a canine version of Alzheimer's disease. Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CDS) is a condition that appears to be a geriatric onset of gradual behavioral changes in dogs, which are not entirely attributable to other general medical conditions. Clinical signs include cognitive dysfunction, personality change, anxiety, confusion and altered special orientation. Large breeds show these signs of aging earlier than small breeds. Some giant breeds show these signs at 5 or 6 years of age, while some of the smaller breeds show few signs of aging by 10 years of age. There is no blood test or scan to diagnose canine cognitive dysfunction. The cause of canine cognitive dysfunction is unknown, but physical evidence found only in autopsies reveals degenerative brain lesions.

Clinical characteristics Leukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",

      "title": "RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP QUALITY, BODY PERCEPTION AND MOTOR AND SENSORY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is an autoimmune neurological disease, where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of the central nervous system, causing inflammation that impairs the transmission of nerve impulses. It is characterized by episodes of flare-ups with exacerbation of symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness in the lower and upper limbs, tremors and balance, difficulty walking, loss of vision, among others, followed by remissions with partial or complete recovery, which can last for months or years, during which the progression of the disease is minimal or absent. Insomnia or poor sleep quality can occur indirectly as a consequence of RRMS. That is, a secondary symptom that is caused by the presence of the specific symptoms of the disease and pseudo-outbreaks. Body Perception (PC) can be defined in two ways, such as Body Image (CI) and Body Schema (CE). HF is related to the psychic, emotional, cognitive, sociocultural, evolutionary, genetic and neuroscientific aspects, in relation to the expectation of the image of their body. The CS is the perspective that enables, through kinesthetic and proprioceptive mechanisms, the recognition of the anatomical body and the relationship it establishes with the environment and with the objects around it. In view of these definitions, the opportunity arose to relate sleep quality with body perception and symptomatological conditions. Thus, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between sleep quality and body perception, by the aspect of body schema and the symptomatological conditions of multiple sclerosis. Participants were 18 people, aged between 21 and 67 years, who were evaluated for sleep quality using the Pittsburgh questionnaire, body perception using the Askevold test, and symptoms through a structured interview. The results indicated that all participants with adequate sleep were classified as hyperschematic, while 67% of those who had inadequate sleep were classified as hyposchematic. In addition, individuals with inadequate sleep showed a balanced distribution between motor and sensory symptoms, while those with adequate sleep predominantly reported sensory symptoms. Fatigue was a relevant symptom in 67% of individuals with inadequate sleep. These findings suggest that sleep quality may be associated with body perception and symptom manifestation in RRMS, highlighting the importance of sleep-enhancing interventions for the management of this condition.",

      "title": "Cognition and Brain Function in Schizotypy: A Selective Review",
      "abstract": "Schizotypy refers to a set of personality traits thought to reflect the subclinical expression of the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia. Here, we review the cognitive and brain functional profile associated with high questionnaire scores in schizotypy. We discuss empirical evidence from the domains of perception, attention, memory, imagery and representation, language, and motor control. Perceptual deficits occur early and across various modalities. While the neural mechanisms underlying visual impairments may be linked to magnocellular dysfunction, further effects may be seen downstream in higher cognitive functions. Cognitive deficits are observed in inhibitory control, selective and sustained attention, incidental learning, and memory. In concordance with the cognitive nature of many of the aberrations of schizotypy, higher levels of schizotypy are associated with enhanced vividness and better performance on tasks of mental rotation. Language deficits seem most pronounced in higher-level processes. Finally, higher levels of schizotypy are associated with reduced performance on oculomotor tasks, resembling the impairments seen in schizophrenia. Some of these deficits are accompanied by reduced brain activation, akin to the pattern of hypoactivations in schizophrenia spectrum individuals. We conclude that schizotypy is a construct with apparent phenomenological overlap with schizophrenia and stable interindividual differences that covary with performance on a wide range of perceptual, cognitive, and motor tasks known to be impaired in schizophrenia. The importance of these findings lies not only in providing a fine-grained neurocognitive characterization of a personality constellation known to be associated with real-life impairments, but also in generating hypotheses concerning the aetiology of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "A specific cognitive status epilepticus (e.g. aphasic status epilepticus) can occur occasionally, but the commoner and best known of purely or mainly cognitive manifestations are those subsumed under the term nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). This corresponds to a prolonged alteration of the mental state with continuous or sub-continuous generalized spikes or spike-wave discharges on the EEG. The prototype is absence status (petit mal status, spike-wave stupor, minor epileptic status),13,14 where there is clouding of awareness but, presumably, no specific cognitive deficit. Apathy, drowsiness, slowness, inattention, perplexity, strange affect, amnesia, slow speech are the most obvious abnormal behaviors. It is not clear to what degree higher-level mental functions are truly preserved and what new memories can be formed during these episodes: detailed studies are rare.15These NCSE can be phases in primary generalized epilepsies, but may be manifestations of complex partial status epilepticus of temporal or frontal origin.15 In temporal partial status epilepticus, only limited purposeful organized activity and responses to outside stimuli are possible and there is usually a total amnesia for the period. The epileptic nature is recognized by the presence, often subtle, of automatic motor behavior and vegetative phenomena.16,17 A special form of frequent refractory nonconvulsive partial status epilepticus, associated with ring chromosome 20, is probably of frontal origin and, because it is so frequent, should allow exploration of the affected and preserved behaviors and memories during seizures.18,19",

      "title": "Two Cases of Narcolepsy Patient Portraying a Tendency of a Dull Learning Ability and Mistaken as an Idle Student",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sleepiness is associated with many different conditions and, as a neglected topic, it can be the cause of serious psychologica l and social disadvantages. In the aspect of learning, additional pro blems may arise from poor progress in school caused by the effe ct of sleepiness on concentration, memory, and other cognitive functi ons. Narcolepsy is by no means the most common cause of excessive sleepiness. Nonetheless, it is not a rarity, especial ly in young people. The non-specific nature of early features o f narcolepsy, combined with very limited awareness that the condition can start in various ways, leads to many misinterpretations. Misinterpretation of narcolepsy symptoms is not confined to the medical profession. Teachers may well be critical of a student with narcolepsy because of their perception of narcolepsy symptoms a s laziness, poor motivation, or difficult behavior and dull lea rning ability. Inappropriate reactions by parents, teachers, and peer s, based on misinterpretation of narcolepsy symptoms or the pat ient’s reactions to them, make a difficult situation worse. Especially in Korea, where schooling is focused on college entrance exami-nations, the problem is very serious and intensified by inappro priate or delayed diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, psychiatr ists should be aware that narcolepsy in young adolescents is not rar e and that they need to be familiar with its clinical features in both its classic and less obvious forms. Narcolepsy should be suspec ted if a adolescent’s excessive sleepiness can not be explained in other ways. Therefore, we report on two patients who portray the tendency o f dull learning ability and are mistaken as idle students. We diagnosed narcolepsy through polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing. We treated the students with methylphenidate and pemolin. The students showed improvement in learning a bility and were able to adapt better to school.",

      "abstract": "Aims: Describe a case report highlighting the evaluation and interpretation of cognitive deficits in patients with suspected dementia. Case description An elderly aged 64 years, with well-controlled hypertension and diabetes and no history of memory complaints, developed cognitive decline of rapid onset (three months). She was evaluated in a private practice and treated with an anticholinesterase inhibitor, without having been performed a cognitive screening and evaluation by neuroimaging. During comprehensive geriatric assessment we found significant impairment of attention and concentration, and verbal and motor perserveration. We suspected of frontal-subcortical impairment, associated with rapid cognitive decline, suggesting a frontal/fronto parietal traumatic or neoplastic injury. Neuroimaging and subsequent biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. Conclusions: Cognitive impairment of rapid onset and abnormal responses of specific functions can corroborate or increase the level of suspicion for unusual etiologies of dementia. Proper screening or neuropsychological testing, as part of a comprehensive geriatric assessment, can increase the likelihood and accuracy in identifying differential diagnoses.",

      "title": "Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Initial symptoms of multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) can develop from infancy through early childhood, and presentation is widely variable. Some individuals display the multisystemic features characteristic of mucopolysaccharidosis disorders (e.g., developmental regression, organomegaly, skeletal deformities) while other individuals present primarily with neurologic regression (associated with leukodystrophy). Based on age of onset, rate of progression, and disease severity, several different clinical subtypes of MSD have been described: Neonatal MSD is the most severe with presentation in the prenatal period or at birth with rapid progression and death occurring within the first two years of life. Infantile MSD is the most common variant and may be characterized as attenuated (slower clinical course with cognitive disability and neurodegeneration identified in the 2nd year of life) or severe (loss of the majority of developmental milestones by age 5 years). Juvenile MSD is the rarest subtype with later onset of symptoms and subacute clinical presentation. Many of the features found in MSD are progressive, including neurologic deterioration, heart disease, hearing loss, and airway compromise. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of multiple sulfatase deficiency is established in a proband with low activity levels in at least two sulfatase enzymes and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in SUMF1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Progressive hydrocephalus, seizures, spasticity, spine instability or stenosis, eye anomalies, cardiovascular disease, hearing loss, poor growth, dental anomalies, developmental delays, and respiratory issues are managed in the standard fashion. Obstructive sleep apnea may be treated with adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy, although affected individuals have a higher surgical complication rate; ventilator support (CPAP, BiPAP) can also be considered. Precautions are needed during anesthesia to address airway maintenance, as progressive upper airway obstruction and cervical spine instability are common. Poor bone health may require supplementation with vitamin D and encouragement of weight-bearing exercises. Alternative routes for nutrition (tube feeding) are frequently necessary. Surveillance: Monitoring of head circumference at each visit; serial brain/spine imaging, as needed based on symptoms; cervical spine imaging prior to any procedure that requires neck extension. At least annual vitamin D level, eye examination with intraocular pressure measurement, EKG, echocardiogram, and audiology evaluation. Abdominal ultrasound, sleep study and pulmonary function tests, neuropsychiatric testing, and assessment of blood and urine acid-base balance as clinically indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Neck hyperextension (including hyperextension used for intubation) because of the risk of spinal cord compression; foods that are a choking hazard. Genetic Counseling Multiple sulfatase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% change of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible using molecular genetic techniques if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

      "title": "Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Manifesting as Sign Language in a Patient with Dementia with Lewy Bodies",
      "abstract": "We present a patient who had a diagnosis of probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) according to consensus guidelines.1 Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) was part of his clinical spectrum. Unrelated to his neurodegenerative process, our patient had severe hearing impairment and was a native signer in American Sign Language (ASL)—his main source of linguistic communication. As part of his dream-enactment behavior, he would fluently sign rather than verbalize in spoken language. This manifestation of RBD has not been previously reported and allows for discussion of the similar neural systems that underlie both spoken and signed language. We present the case of a 71-year-old, right-handed man who had childhood-onset, severe hearing impairment with a more recent history, since age 67, of progressive parkinsonism. Motor manifestations included bilateral rigidity, bradykinesia, and rest tremors. Early in the disease course, he developed dementia and psychosis with well-formed “Lilliputian” visual hallucinations, which were treated with neuroleptic medications. His psychosis has progressed to include delusions (including Capgras delusion, insisting his wife was an imposter, and that the Movement Disorders fellow was Pablo Escobar) and aggressive outbursts, necessitating ongoing treatment with neuroleptic medications. His prior neuroleptic treatments had included risperidone and quetiapine, both of which significantly worsened his motor symptoms. Quetiapine was withdrawn and pimavanserin was initiated with recurrence of his aggressive behavior, which was then quelled with olanzapine. Rivastigmine was added to further control visual hallucinations. His response to carbidopa-levodopa has not been robust. During sleep, he displayed dream-enactment behavior, including punching and kicking (occasionally inflicting minor injuries on his bed partner). In addition, he would fluently sign in ASL. The situation in his dreamscape could be deduced by his signing. DLB1 is a synucleinopathy and is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia. Aside from the core features that define this condition, there are supportive features, such as RBD, which increase diagnostic sensitivity. RBD was reported in 96% of patients with DLB in a polysomnographic (PSG) study.2 On PSG, which is needed to definitively diagnose the condition, RBD manifests as increased electromyographic tone with dream-enactment behavior during REM sleep.3 In a given patient, parkinsonism may limit mobility during wakefulness, but the movements associated with RBD can be faster, stronger, and smoother; and speech may be more comprehensible.4 It has been suggested that the movement generated by the motor cortex can bypass the abnormal extrapyramidal system to continue as the corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts.4 Without PSG for definitive diagnosis, other parasomnias and nocturnal events must be included in the differential diagnosis of RBD. Parasomnias of slow-wave sleep, such as confusional arousals or night terrors, should be considered.3 RBD and non-REM parasomnias can be clinically differentiated. Patients with non-REM parasomnias tend to be amnestic to the event and are difficult to arouse from sleep during the behavior.5 In RBD, the patient may recall a vivid dream and is more easily awoken, which resolves the behavior.5 The possibility that the patient is actually awake and responding to hallucinations should be considered. However, according to the patient and his bed partner's recollection, our patient is asleep while signing, and he can recall the vivid dream associated with the actions. Given the clinical history and that RBD is quite prevalent in DLB, the described behavior is most likely a manifestation of RBD. Fluent signing of ASL has not been reported as a manifestation of RBD. Sign languages, like spoken languages, have linguistic structure, established vocabularies, and grammatical principles. We have evidence for a similar neural substrate underlying the expression and comprehension of both signed and spoken language. For example, a similar deleterious effect on expressive or receptive language (spoken or gestured) can be expected from an insult to the dominant hemisphere of the brain. Furthermore, functional imaging studies show left hemispheric perisylvian cortex activation—in Broca's area for expression and Wernicke's area for comprehension of signed language.6 We also know that nonlanguage hand gestures, as opposed to language hand gestures (emblems), have different neural substrates. This is supported by functional imaging studies showing that signers engage left-lateralized language centers when viewing sign language, whereas nonsigners (who would interpret sign language as nonspecific gestures) only activate areas attuned to perceiving movement7 (such as the premotor cortex and inferior parietal lobule).8 Sign language is equivalent to spoken language (and different from nonspecific hand gestures) in terms of central processing (with the exception of the need for auditory cortex to perceive spoken language). Thus, in a patient with RBD who is native in ASL, it is reasonable to expect that hand signing would replace the expected abnormal vocalizations. Our patient represents a classic case of DLB. As a native in ASL, he provides a unique manifestation of RBD. In addition, this case further supports the concept of similar neural substrates involved in both signed and spoken language. 1.

      "title": "Central ocular motor disorders, including gaze palsy and nystagmus",
      "abstract": "An impairment of eye movements, or nystagmus, is seen in many diseases of the central nervous system, in particular those affecting the brainstem and cerebellum, as well as in those of the vestibular system. The key to diagnosis is a systematic clinical examination of the different types of eye movements, including: eye position, range of eye movements, smooth pursuit, saccades, gaze-holding function and optokinetic nystagmus, as well as testing for the different types of nystagmus (e.g., central fixation nystagmus or peripheral vestibular nystagmus). Depending on the time course of the signs and symptoms, eye movements often indicate a specific underlying cause (e.g., stroke or neurodegenerative or metabolic disorders). A detailed knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of eye movements enables the physician to localize the disturbance to a specific area in the brainstem (midbrain, pons or medulla) or cerebellum (in particular the flocculus). For example, isolated dysfunction of vertical eye movements is due to a midbrain lesion affecting the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle, with impaired vertical saccades only, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal or the posterior commissure; common causes with an acute onset are an infarction or bleeding in the upper midbrain or in patients with chronic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C). Isolated dysfunction of horizontal saccades is due to a pontine lesion affecting the paramedian pontine reticular formation due, for instance, to brainstem bleeding, glioma or Gaucher disease type 3; an impairment of horizontal and vertical saccades is found in later stages of PSP, NP-C and Gaucher disease type 3. Gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN) in all directions indicates a cerebellar dysfunction and can have multiple causes such as drugs, in particular antiepileptics, chronic alcohol abuse, neurodegenerative cerebellar disorders or cerebellar ataxias; purely vertical GEN is due to a midbrain lesion, while purely horizontal GEN is due to a pontomedullary lesion. The pathognomonic clinical sign of internuclear ophthalmoplegia is an impaired adduction while testing horizontal saccades on the side of the lesion in the ipsilateral medial longitudinal fascicule. The most common pathological types of central nystagmus are downbeat nystagmus (DBN) and upbeat nystagmus (UBN). DBN is generally due to cerebellar dysfunction affecting the flocculus bilaterally (e.g., due to a neurodegenerative disease). Treatment options exist for a few disorders: miglustat for NP-C and aminopyridines for DBN and UBN. It is therefore particularly important to identify treatable cases with these conditions.",

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

      "abstract": "The classical syndrome of delirium has an abrupt onset. In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) may be the initial manifestation of synucleinopathies (Parkinson disease [PD], multiple system atrophy [MSA], or dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB]).We used the Mayo medical records linkage system to identify cases presenting from 2002 to 2006 meeting the criteria of idiopathic RBD at onset, plus at least 15 years between RBD and development of other neurodegenerative symptoms. All patients underwent evaluations by specialists in sleep medicine to confirm RBD, and behavioral neurology or movement disorders to confirm the subsequent neurodegenerative syndrome.Clinical criteria were met by 27 patients who experienced isolated RBD for at least 15 years before evolving into PD, PD dementia (PDD), DLB, or MSA. The interval between RBD and subsequent neurologic syndrome ranged up to 50 years, with the median interval 25 years. At initial presentation, primary motor symptoms occurred in 13 patients: 9 with PD, 3 with PD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 1 with PDD. Primary cognitive symptoms occurred in 13 patients: 10 with probable DLB and 3 with MCI. One patient presented with primary autonomic symptoms, diagnosed as MSA. At most recent follow-up, 63% of patients progressed to develop dementia (PDD or DLB). Concomitant autonomic dysfunction was confirmed in 74% of all patients.These cases illustrate that the alpha-synuclein pathogenic process may start decades before the first symptoms of PD, DLB, or MSA. A long-duration preclinical phase has important implications for epidemiologic studies and future interventions designed to slow or halt the neurodegenerative process.",

Delayed development is denned as a substantial retardation as compared to the standard indicators in any of the basic spheres: motor, communicative, cognitive, adaptive-behavioral, and socioemotional ones. Global developmental delay is characterized by a significant lag in two or more spheres. The use of current diagnostic techniques, such as the Bayley or Griffiths scales, can provide an objective quantitative assessment of both an infant's overall development and indicators in individual spheres. At the preliminary examination stage, it is expedient to carry out a Denver developmental screening test that may be directly used in a doctor's consulting room. The causes of global developmental delay/intellectual disability in infants may be perinatal central nervous system (CNS) lesions; brain malformations; intrauterine infections; intrauterine intoxications; early-onset psychoneurological diseases (neuroinfections, CNS injuries, epilepsies, autism spectrum disorders, etc.); congenital hypothyroidism; genetic diseases. Among all genetic causes of global developmental delay/intellectual disability, there are chromosomal anomalies (25-30%), monogenic diseases (metabolic diseases, neuroectodermal syndromes, diseases with predominant grey and white matter involvement). The diagnostic possibilities of current genetic methods are considered.",

      "abstract": "Because there are no direct biological markers for the substances implicated in indoor air exposure, it is impossible to directly measure if an individual or group of individuals has been exposed to a potentially neurotoxic substance in the workplace. Behavioral changes may be the earliest and only manifestation of central nervous system (CNS) effects and are often too subtle to be revealed by routine physical or neurological examination. Neuropsychological techniques are sensitive to subtle behavioral/cognitive changes that can result from exposure to neurotoxins. These techniques consist of oral and written tests that are administered by a trained examiner on a one-to-one basis. In general, a wide variety of cognitive domains are evaluated. The typical battery generally includes assessing orientation, attention, intelligence, language, visual memory, verbal memory, perception, visuoconstruction, simple motor speed, psychomotor speed, and mood. As with most assessment techniques, the neuropsychological methods have limitations. One major drawback is the availability of appropriate norms that are used to compare the results of a specific individual. Because these tasks are greatly affected by age, intelligence, and in some instances sex, the availability of appropriate norms is mandatory to determine if the CNS has been effected. Although neuropsychological tests are sensitive to the presence of CNS involvement, they are not specific. Patterns of performance seen with specific instances of neurotoxic exposure may also be seen with a number of other diseases of the CNS such as dementia, cerebrovascular disease, hydrocephalus, or normal aging. In addition, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and/or depression are often manifested as cognitive difficulties that will mimic the cognitive dysfunction seen with toxicity of the CNS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We identified neurocognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a patient diagnosed with CBD. Participant was a 70-year-old female patient, single; she presented progressive memory loss of an immediate verbal nature. Initially, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy body dementia, finding that she had no characteristic signs and symptoms of these pathologies. The patient presented conciliation insomnia, gait disturbances, and severe neurocognitive deficit, especially in executive functions, immediate verbal memory, and visuospatial functioning. It was found that the patient presented neurocognitive alterations of the executive type (frontal lobe) such as decision making, planning, inhibition and operative memory, correlated with a severe alteration in her basic, instrumental and advanced activities of daily life, with a high risk factor for developing dementia. It is necessary to diagnose in an assertive and timely manner in order to generate functional neurorehabilitation plans in people diagnosed with CBD, with the main objective of positively impacting quality of life, at the individual, family, and social level.",

      "abstract": "Functional loss of vision or visual fields can present some of the most difficult diagnostic challenges, but even more difficult to diagnose are patients who have, in addition to functional visual loss, an organic disease. No matter how functional the symptoms appear, the clinician has to go that extra step to find any true pathology. This is why different field techniques may be more appropriate than the more sophisticated techniques. A tangent screen, for instance, may be better to control the patient’s response than a Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer. Remember the functional patients get sick, too. Patients with functional field loss can be placed into one of three general groups: neurasthenics, hysterics, or malingerers. The neurasthenic patient usually has many complaints, not limited to the visual system or to one set of visual symptoms such as field loss. The complaints, as well as the degree of field or visual defect, frequently vary from one examination to another, as well as during an examination as fatigue increases. The spiral field is often found in neurasthenic patients. The patient with hysteria, on the other hand, usually has a single ocular complaint. This chapter discusses the hysterical loss of acuity or fields. The usual field defect is a severe tubular type of contraction. The spiral field is sometimes seen in these patients. The malingerer may be the most difficult patient with functional loss, particularly if he has previously been examined by another physician and has acquired more experience with field testing than he had when first examined. The spiral field is not limited to functional loss; it can also be seen as a fatigue phenomenon in sick patients when the field testing is unduly prolonged. Its essential feature is that the field becomes progressively smaller as a specific isopter is tested for a second and third time with the same size of test object. shows all the points that were tested with a 3-mm white test object.",

This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births. More than 95% of infants with neonatal stroke survive to adulthood, and many have some form of motor or cognitive disability.",

Based on some new hypothesis, the methods to rule out other possibly treatable diseases are also used for detecting neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is categorized as an incurable, degenerative neurological disorder. The AD patients display a loss of resting-state functional connectivity in lower alpha and beta bands even when a measure insensitive to volume-conduction effects, such as phase lag index, is used. Exploratory analysis showed that quantitative electroencephalogram measures could predict a dementia with Lewy bodies versus an AD diagnosis with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Some neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, affect the basal ganglia and lead to movement difficulties.",

Although there is growing evidence that neuropsychiatric symptoms may precede the prodromal stages of dementia, these manifestations have received less attention than traditional clinical hallmarks such as cognitive and functional deterioration. Depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, agitation, sleep disorders, among other symptoms, have been hypothesized to represent a prodromal stage of dementia or, at least, they increase the risk for conversion from minor neurocognitive disorder to major neurocognitive disorder. Longitudinal investigations have provided increased evidence of progression to dementia in individuals with minor neurocognitive disorder when neuropsychiatric symptoms also were present.Although neuropsychiatric symptoms are strongly associated with a higher risk of cognitive and functional deterioration, frequently the clinician does not acknowledge these conditions as increasing the risk of dementia. When the clinician accurately diagnoses neuropsychiatric symptoms in the prodromal stage of dementia, he could early establish appropriate treatment and, may be, delay the beginning of clinical and functional deterioration.",

      "abstract": "Recent evidence from cognitive science and neuroscience indicates that brain-damaged patients and normal subjects can exhibit nonconscious or implicit knowledge of stimuli that they fail to recollect consciously or perceive explicitly. Dissociations between implicit and explicit knowledge, which have been observed across a variety of domains, tasks, and materials, raise fundamental questions about the nature of perception, memory, and consciousness. This article provides a selective review of relevant evidence and considers such phenomena as priming and implicit memory in amnesic patients and normal subjects, perception without awareness and \"blindsight\" in patients with damage to visual cortex, and nonconscious recognition of familiar faces in patients with facial-recognition deficits (prosopagnosia). A variety of theoretical approaches to implicit/explicit dissociations are considered. One view is that all of the various dissociations can be attributed to disruption or disconnection of a common mechanism underlying conscious experience; an alternative possibility is that each dissociation requires a separate explanation in terms of domain-specific processes and systems. More generally, it is concluded that rather than reflecting the operation of affectively charged unconscious processes of the kind invoked by psychodynamic or Freudian theorists, dissociations between implicit and explicit knowledge are a natural consequence of the ordinary computations of the brain.",

      "abstract": "Diseases with movement disorders may be difficult to diagnose, both at the onset, when motor symptoms are mild and not sufficiently specific (e.g., difficulty in manipulating objects), or at end stage when distinctive motor signs are diluted in a severe and polymorphous clinical picture (eg, gait disorder with postural instability and cognitive decline in aged patients). Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

In addition, there may be psychophysical changes, disturbances of complex visual functions such as visuospatial orientation and facial recognition, and chronic visual hallucinations. Some of the treatments associated with PD may have adverse ocular reactions. If visual problems are present, they can have an important effect on overall motor function, and quality of life of patients can be improved by accurate diagnosis and correction of such defects. Moreover, visual testing is useful in separating PD from other movement disorders with visual symptoms, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).

Even if the symptoms presenting in the patients are not able to discriminate between the underlying aetiologies, it is possible that associated neurocognitive deficits do. Depression is a disorder of mood, cognition, and behaviour with associated disturbance of brain structure and function. Psychomotor retardation reflects ventral striatum-cortico-thalamic network dysfunction and is associated with severe depression. There is decreased hippocampal volume and disturbed memory and learning in depression. Amygdala–anterior cingulate networks normally responsible for emotion regulation are disturbed in depression. Cognitive distortions seen in depression have associated abnormalities in prefrontal regions. Neurocognitive characteristics can distinguish between unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders.",

Cognition, vertical eye movement, blinking, and hearing are classically preserved in patients suffering from the condition. The diagnosis of the locked-in syndrome is often challenging due to its similarity with conditions such as akinetic mutism and coma. It may take weeks to diagnose, and family members at the bedside are usually the first to notice the decreased motor functions of the patient.Locked-in syndrome has three main types. The classical form is defined by total immobility, with the preservation of the ability to perform vertical eye movements, blink, and maintain a normal level of consciousness. The incomplete form is defined as the classical form with small additional motor functions. The total immobility form is defined as a complete body paralysis, and loss of eye movement with the preservation of cortical function examined via EEG. In the classical and incomplete forms, consciousness is often evaluated by blink-response or eye movement-response to questions. An EEG may be used in patients in the complete form to assess brain activity, sleep-wake cycles, and attention. In the acute setting, CT or MRI of the brain helps characterize the causative agent to establish a treatment earlier. Physical examinations analyzing motor function, sensation, and reflexes are often reassessed to rule out other potential conditions and estimate the rate of recovery in patients. Due to the rare nature of this condition, recovery and management have been a topic of debate. Still, an increasing amount of literature has demonstrated efficacy in traditional supportive management and rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Understanding Visual Disorders through Correlation of Clinical and Radiologic Findings",
      "abstract": "Patients presenting with visual disturbances often require a neuroimaging approach. The spectrum of visual disturbances includes three main categories: vision impairment, ocular motility dysfunction, and abnormal pupillary response. Decreased vision is usually due to an eye abnormality. However, it can also be related to other disorders affecting the visual pathway, from the retina to the occipital lobe. Ocular motility dysfunction may follow disorders of the cranial nerves responsible for eye movements (ie, oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves); may be due to any abnormality that directly affects the extraocular muscles, such as tumor or inflammation; or may result from any orbital disease that can alter the anatomy or function of these muscles, leading to diplopia and strabismus. Given that pupillary response depends on the normal function of the sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, an abnormality affecting these neuronal systems manifests, respectively, as pupillary miosis or mydriasis, with other related symptoms. In some cases, neuroimaging studies must complement the clinical ophthalmologic examination to better assess the anatomic and pathologic conditions that could explain the symptoms. US has a major role in the assessment of diseases of the eye and anterior orbit. CT is usually the first-line imaging modality because of its attainability, especially in trauma settings. MRI offers further information for inflammatory and tumoral cases. ©RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.",

      "title": "THE NONMOTOR PROBLEMS OF PARKINSONʼS DISEASE",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Although the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) dominate the clinical picture, the nonmotor complaints are often more disabling for the Parkinson patient. REVIEW SUMMARY Behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive changes occur commonly and are frequent causes for concern. Depression affects up to half of Parkinson patients and can worsen their motor function. Drug-induced psychoses can range from benign visual hallucinations to paranoid delusions. Dementia, classically described as subcortical, usually occurs in the elderly PD patient and is often clinically distinct from the cortical dementia of Alzheimer's disease although pathological descriptions overlap. A parkinsonian personality has been noted by psychoanalysts and movement disorder experts characterized as rigid and compulsive yet cautious and apprehensive with a subordinate behavior. Sleep disturbances associated with PD include insomnia, sleep fragmentation, daytime somnolence, vivid dreams, rapid eye movement behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome. Sensory symptoms, including pain, may occur, as do symptoms of autonomic dysfunction including postural syncope. Problems with bladder and bowel control and sexual dysfunction are common and often distressing to both the patients and their partners. Fatigue, akathisia, seborrheic dermatitis, and scoliosis are conditions intrinsic to or aggravated by PD. Most of these problems are amenable to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. CONCLUSION Helping patients with PD cope with these difficulties is just as important as manipulating therapy to provide control of their motor symptoms. (THE NEUROLOGIST 6:18-27, 2000)",

Estas se definen como un grupo de padecimientos de origen en muchos casos desconocido y que tienen como atributo común el curso progresivo de los síntomas derivados del daño estructural y funcional de diferentes zonas del sistema nervioso. La Demencia o Trastorno Cognitivo, ocurre cuando el cerebro se afecta por una enfermedad o afección específica que causa deterioro cognitivo. La secuencia en el espectro de la demencia puede terminar en la forma más grave de la enfermedad. El deterioro cognitivo en muchos casos transita desde el leve, referido a una disminución de la función cognitiva mayor de lo esperado por la edad y al nivel de educación del individuo, pero sin interferir con sus actividades cotidianas. El diagnóstico temprano de la enfermedad y la asunción de tratamientos y sobre todo estilos de vida saludables, puede evitar o enlentecer el tránsito hacia la gravedad de la enfermedad y por ende mejorar la calidad de vida. Con el objetivo de contribuir a este propósito se diseñó una herramienta de software denominada Neuromap que permite obtener patrones de conectividad a partir de señales de EEG y realizar una prueba de profundidad de la demencia. De esta forma se enriquecen los instrumentos con que cuentan en la actualidad los especialistas de las ciencias médicas para obtener un mejor y más eficaz diagnóstico.

      "title": "Delirium in Elderly People: A Review",
      "abstract": "The present review aims to highlight this intricate syndrome, regarding diagnosis, pathophysiology, etiology, prevention and management in elderly people. The diagnosis of delirium is based on clinical observations, cognitive assessment, detailed family history, physical and neurological examination. Clinically, delirium occurs in hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed forms, based on psychomotor behaviour. As an acute confusional state, it is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms, fluctuating course and an altered level of consciousness, global disturbance of cognition or perceptual abnormalities and evidence of a physical cause. In spite of pathophysiological mechanisms of delirium remaining unclear, current evidence suggests that disruption of neurotransmission, inflammation or acute stress responses might all contribute to the development of this ailment. It usually occurs as a result of a complex interaction of multiple risk factors, such as cognitive impairment/dementia, current hip fracture and presence of severe illness. Despite all of the above, delirium is frequently under-recognized and often misdiagnosed by health professionals. In particular, this happens due to its fluctuating nature, its overlap with dementia and the scarcity of routine formal cognitive assessment in general hospitals. It is also associated with multiple adverse outcomes that have been well documented, such as increased hospital stay, function/cognitive decline, institutionalization and mortality. In this context, early identification of delirium will be essential. Timely and optimal management of people with delirium, should be performed with identification of possible underlying causes, dealing with a suitable care environment and improving education of health professionals. All these can be important factors, which contribute to a decrease in adverse outcomes associated with delirium.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Aspects of Brain Injury in Childhood: A Review",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Children suffering with brain injury or epilepsy run an appreciably increased risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. The reasons for this are not clear, however. There have been few relevant follow‐up or treatment studies and it is still not known whether the associated presence of brain injury or epilepsy influences the natural history or treatability of a given type of psychiatric disorder. Abnormalities of gestational length, complications of delivery or infection of the nervous system do not appear to increase the risk of psychiatric disorder unless followed by manifest signs of brain injury. Children with structural damage and fits, and children with temporal lobe epilepsy seem to be those who are most likely to develop a behaviour disturbance. Brain‐damaged children may suffer from any type of psychiatric condition. There is no particular disorder that occurs with disproportionate frequency in the neuro‐epileptic population, and by implication there do not seem to be any specific behavioural syndromes which are themselves pathognomonic of central nervous system damage or dysfunction. RÉSUMÉ Aspects psychiatriques des lésions cérébrales dans l'enfance Les enfants souffrant d'une lésion cérébrale ou d'une épilepsie ont un risque nettement accru de présenter un trouble psychiatrique. Les raisons n'en sont cependant pas très claires. Peu d'études longitudinales ou thérapeutiques ont été entreprises et il n'est toujours pas établi que la présence associée d'un traumatisme cérébral ou d'une épilepsie marque l'histoire naturelle ou la curabilité d'un type donné de trouble psychiatrique. Les anomalies du temps de gestation, les complications de l'accouchement ou les infections du système nerveux ne semblent pas accroitre le risque de troubles psychiatriques s'il n'y a pas eu de signes manifestes de lésion cérébrale. Les enfants présentant des troubles structurés ou des crises et les enfants avec épilepsie du lobe temporal sont ceux qui ont le plus de chances de développer un trouble du comportement. Une lésion cérébrale chez l'enfant peut évoluer vers n'importe quel type de condition psychiatrique. II n'y a pas de désordres particuliers survenant avec une fréquence disproportionnée dans une population neuroépileptique; par voie de conséquences, il ne semble y avoir aucun syndrome comportemental spécifique qui soit pathognomonique d'un dommage ou d'une dysfonction du système nerveux central. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Psychiatrische Aspekte der Hirnverletzungen im Kindesalter Kinder, die an einer Hirnverletzung oder einer Epilepsie leiden, haben ein bedeutend höheres Risiko eine psychische Störung zu entwickeln. Die Gründe dafür sind jedoch nicht ganz klar. Es sind nur wenig relevante Langzeit‐ oder Behandlungsstudien gemacht worden und es ist noch nicht bekannt, ob eine Hirnverletzung oder Epilepsie den normalen Verlauf einer bestimmten psychischen Erkrankung, oder die Ansprechbarkeit auf die Therapie beeinflussen. Abnorme Gestationsperioden, Komplikationen bei der Geburt oder Infektionen des Nervensystems scheinen das Risiko für die Entstehung einer psychischen Erkrankung nicht zu erhöhen, es sei denn es treten danach deutliche Zeichen eines Hirnschadens auf. Kinder mit Fehlbildungen, Krämpfen und Temporallappenepilepsie entwickeln offenbar am ehesten Verhaltensstörungen. Hirngeschädigte Kinder können jegliche Art eines psychiatrischen Zustandbildes bieten. Es gibt keine spezielle Erkrankung, die mit übermäßiger Häufigkeit bei dem neuro‐epilepti‐schen Krankengut vorkommt und damit scheint es keine spezifischen Verhaltenssyndrome zu geben, die selbst pathognomonisch für eine Schädigung oder Dysfunktion des Zentralnervensystems sind. RESUMEN Aspectos psiquiàtricos de la lesión cerebral en la infancia Los niños que sufren de lesión cerebral o de epilepsia corren un riesgo apreciablemente aumentado de padecer una alteración psiquiátrica. Sin embargo las razones de ello no están claras. Se han realizado pocos estudios seriados o estudios de tratamiento y todavía no se sabe si la presencia asociada de una lesión cerebral o de epilepsia influencia la evolución o la posibilidad de tratamiento de un determinado tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. Las anomalías en la duración gestacional, complicaciones del parto o infección del sistema nervioso, no parece que aumenten el riesgo de una alteración psiquiátrica, salvo que vayan seguidos de signos manifiestos de lesión cerebral. Los niños con alteración estructural y convulsiones y niños con epilepsia del lóbulo temporal parece que son los que tienen más tendencia a desarrollar una alteración en el comportamiento. Los niños con lesión cerebral pueden sufrir cualquier tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. No hay ninguna alteración en particular que aparezca en la población neuro‐epiléptica con una frecuencia desproporcionada y por implicación no parece que haya ningún síndrome especifico del comportamiento que sea por sí mismo patogmónico de una lesión o disfunción del sistema nervioso central.",

      "title": "The clinical assessment of the patient with early dementia",
      "abstract": "ementia is a clinical state characterised by a loss of function in at least two cognitive domains.When making a diagnosis of dementia, features to look for include memory impairment and at least one of the following: aphasia, apraxia, agnosia and/or disturbances in executive functioning.To be significant the impairments should be severe enough to cause problems with social and occupational functioning and the decline must have occurred from a previously higher level.It is important to exclude delirium when considering such a diagnosis.When approaching the patient with a possible dementia, taking a careful history is paramount.Clues to the nature and aetiology of the disorder are often found following careful consultation with the patient and carer.A focused cognitive and physical examination is useful and the presence of specific features may aid in diagnosis.Certain investigations are mandatory and additional tests are recommended if the history and examination indicate particular aetiologies.It is useful when assessing a patient with cognitive impairment in the clinic to consider the following straightforward questions: c Is the patient demented?c If so, does the loss of function conform to a characteristic pattern?c Does the pattern of dementia conform to a particular pattern?c What is the likely disease process responsible for the dementia?An understanding of cognitive function and its anatomical correlates is necessary in order to ascertain which brain areas are affected.This, in turn, aids diagnosis.A discussion of the localisation of all cognitive processes is beyond the scope of this review.It is, however, particularly important to have an understanding of memory and its subdivisions, which is necessary to aid in differential diagnosis.We shall then illustrate how the history and examination, including bedside cognitive testing, are used in diagnosis. TYPES OF MEMORY cWhen considering any memory disorder it is important to have an understanding of the main ''types'' of memory; otherwise erroneous use of the term ''short term memory'' may cause confusion. 1Memory can be thought of in terms of working memory, episodic memory (anterograde and retrograde), semantic memory, remote memory, and implicit memory (table 1).Classically, early Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes defects in anterograde episodic memory (for example, the ability to remember an address after five minutes or longer). 2 The relevance of this is that aspects of memory are subserved by different structures.Certain disease processes have a tendency to start focally and progress in a typical anatomical pattern.They have, therefore, a largely predictable neuropsychological signature.For example, initially AD pathology tends to be perihippocampal, then spreads to temporo-parietal association cortex and latterly involves frontal lobes.This is mirrored by the initial cognitive deficit of anterograde episodic memory, progressing to attentional, semantic memory and visuo-perceptual impairment, with personality change occurring as a later feature. TAKING A HISTORY AND THE EXAMINATION OF THE MEMORY IMPAIRED PATIENTIt is vital to obtain a corroborating history from a relative or close friend in addition to the patient's account if they can provide one.The need to physically examine the patient, looking for signs pointing to a particular cause, is discussed below. History takingIt is useful to interview the patient and the accompanying person separately.The absence of a concerned relative or friend at the appointment may lessen the likelihood of dementia in a patient complaining of memory problems.Interviewing the patient separately enables the cooperation and language skills to be assessed without them being masked by interruptions or assistance from a third party.It also allows an assessment into the degree of insight of the affected individual.Conversation with the patient may be as important as any formal cognitive assessment.The presence of word finding difficulties, paraphasic errors, and inappropriate behaviour is helpful in v15",

Intrauterine growth restriction or low birth weight and feeding difficulties are common. Congenital brain, eye, heart, kidney, genital, and/or skeletal system anomalies have also been reported. About half of affected individuals have neurologic manifestations, including hypotonia and gait abnormalities. Behavioral issues can include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, autism or autistic behavior, and schizoaffective disorder. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of Gabriele-de Vries syndrome is established in a proband by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant involving YY1 or a heterozygous deletion of 14q32.2 involving only YY1. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay / intellectual disability, craniofacial anomalies (Pierre Robin sequence, cleft palate, craniosynostosis, abnormalities of the lacrimal duct), feeding difficulties, gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, seizures, behavioral manifestations, strabismus, refractive error, congenital heart defects, renal anomalies, cryptorchidism, and skeletal anomalies are treated per standard practice. Surveillance: Of clinical manifestations as clinically indicated. Genetic counseling Gabriele-de Vries syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. All probands reported to date with Gabriele-de Vries syndrome whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as a result of a de novo YY1 pathogenic variant or deletion. Risk to future pregnancies is presumed to be low as the proband most likely has a de novo YY1 pathogenic variant or deletion; however, given the theoretic possibility of parental germline mosaicism, recurrence risk to sibs is estimated at 1%, and thus prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing may be considered.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by movement dysfunction due to selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Non-motor symptoms of PD (e.g., sensory dysfunction, sleep disturbance, constipation, neuropsychiatric symptoms) precede motor symptoms, appear at all stages, and impact the quality of life, but they frequently go unrecognized and remain untreated. Even when identified, traditional dopamine replacement therapies have little effect. We discuss here the pathology of two PD-associated non-motor symptoms: olfactory dysfunction and depression. Olfactory dysfunction is one of the earliest non-motor symptoms in PD and predates the onset of motor symptoms. It is accompanied by early deposition of Lewy pathology and neurotransmitter alterations. Because of the correlation between olfactory dysfunction and an increased risk of progression to PD, olfactory testing can potentially be a specific diagnostic marker of PD in the prodromal stage. Depression is a prevalent PD-associated symptom and is often associated with reduced quality of life. Although the pathophysiology of depression in PD is unclear, studies suggest a causal relationship with abnormal neurotransmission and abnormal adult neurogenesis. Here, we summarize recent progress in the pathology of the non-motor symptoms of PD, aiming to provide better guidance for its effective management.",

A typical executive task can be defined as the capacity to maintain one’s attention on the current task, that is, responding only to the correct but not to distractive stimuli. Impairments of executive functions, or executive dysfunctions, have a growing impact on everyday life and academic achievement and are usually an early feature, and one of the core features, in brain injury and memory and behavioral disorders. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that memory therapeutics cannot achieve their clinical benefits in cognition if executive dysfunction is not effectively and simultaneously treated. Improvement of executive functions might be achieved through targeting some signaling pathways in the brain, including the brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathways. These agents may be useful either as stand-alone interventions for patients with executive dysfunction and/or psychiatric and memory disorders or as essential adjuncts to drugs that target the underlying pathology in various brain injury and memory and behavioral disorders.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical, electrophysiological, and autonomic features of a patient with acute autonomic and sensory neuropathy (AASN). BACKGROUND: AASN is a rare disorder that has been only anecdotally reported. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: 11-year-old male presenting with progressive imbalance and severe autonomic and sensory disorders after an upper respiratory tract infection. Autonomic disturbances included vomiting, diarrhea, anhidrosis, dry mouth, dry eyes, orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension. Sensory disturbances included decreased perception of all sensory modalities in limbs and trigeminal area and severe sensory ataxia. Symptoms progressed for a few days and later stabilized. Neurological examination revealed very reduced or absent deep tendon, corneal, and gag reflexes with preserved muscle strength. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. A paraneoplastic panel was negative. Nerve conduction studies showed extremely reduced or absent sensory nerve action potentials in all nerves and absent blink reflex responses with preserved motor action potentials. No signs of peripheral nerve demyelination were found. EMG showed normal motor unit action potentials and full interference recruitment in all muscles, however, some fibrilation potentials were recorded in the right gastrocnemius muscle. Cardiovascular autonomic evaluation during tilt test evidenced decreased heart rate variability, orthostatic hypotension without compensatory tachycardia and very low levels of plasma norepinephrine. Spinal MRI showed extensive T2 hyperintensity of the dorsal aspect of the cervical spinal cord and bilateral focal enhancement of the trigeminal nerves. Several months after onset, significant autonomic and sensory deficits persisted. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of acute autonomic and sensory deficits with preserved muscle strength confirmed the diagnosis of AASN. Despite possibly having an underlying immune-mediated mechanism, AASN cases are rarely diagnosed. A literature search for case or series studies returned 28 articles only. Milder forms of AASN could remain under-diagnosed.",

Symptoms include facial weakness, bulbar disturbances (dysphonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and sialorrhea), and lower motor neuron signs (weakness, atrophy, fasciculation, and cramps) in the limbs. A hallmark of FOSMN is the diminished or absent corneal reflex, indicating trigeminal nerve involvement and leading to potential complications like neurotrophic keratitis (NK), which can cause corneal ulceration and blindness. The etiology of FOSMN remains uncertain, with theories proposing autoimmune or neurodegenerative origins. Diagnosis is challenging due to the overlap with other ocular surface disorders, necessitating careful examination and differential diagnosis. Management focuses on symptomatic relief, including eye protection to prevent corneal complications. Awareness and early detection of ocular symptoms in FOSMN are crucial for preventing severe outcomes like NK and blindness.",

As a consequence there is a sharp inhibition of conditioned and, in part, of unconditioned reflexes. Moreover, active cortical inhibition suffers particularly, and external inhibition is more pronounced. Upon \"return\" from this state of \"inhibition\" to the customary, real age or condition, one observes steady inhibition and, in some cases, positive induction. This confirms the presence of cortical inhibition in an arbitrarily induced condition of age or fatigue. If the subject regards himself as being of a younger age or in a more vigorous situation than usual, this will induce a certain increase in the reflexes.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders.It is characterized by emotional, cognitive, and physical symptoms which can also cause severe disability and disease burden. The current study found that patients with MDD have cognitive impairment in both acute and remission phases, which seriously affect the prognosis of patients. The impairment of visual cognitive function greatly affects the social function of MDD patients and the current researches showed that visual cognitive impairment of MDD patients is closely related to the functional connection in the brain, which can be reflected by different degrees of neuroimaging changes in the frontal, occipital, temporal, and parietal regions.The change of visual cognitive function in patients with MDD is mainly influenced by the frontal lobe and the occipital lobe, which may be related to the large number of visual cortex in the anatomy of the two brain regions. The activation of the frontal lobe may be positively related to the patient's visual cognitive impairment; the reduction of the occipital lobe activity may have an impact on the visual process and may be the starting factor for cognitive impairment. The active enhancement of the parietal region plays an important role in the visual short-term memory. In addition, the temporo-parietal junction is also found to be involved in the processing of visual and working memory, and the activation of temporal lobe and parietal lobe can be observed.This review summarizes recent researches at home and abroad and reveals the visual perception of MDD patients in different ways in each different brain regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey words: \r\nMajor depressive disorder; Visual cognitive; Brain imaging",

      "abstract": "The Landau-Kleffner syndrome or the syndrome of acquired epileptic aphasia was first described in 1957. The disorder is characterized by gradual or rapid loss of language in a previously normal child. Acquired epileptic aphasia (AEA) typically develops in healthy children who acutely or progressively lose receptive and expressive language ability coincident with the appearance of paroxysmal electroencephalographs (EEG) changes. In most cases described in detail, a clearly normal period of motor and language development occurs before acquired epileptic aphasia symptoms appear. Because this syndrome appears during such a critical period of language acquisition in a child’s life, speech production may be affected just as severely as language comprehension. The onset of LKS is typically between 18 months and 13 years. The prevalence of clinical seizures in acquired epileptic aphasia (LKS) is 70-85%. The syndrome can be difficult to diagnose and may be misdiagnosed as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, hearing impairment, learning disability, auditory/ verbal processing disorder, attention deficit disorder, intellectual disability, childhood schizophrenia, or emotional/behavioural problems. An EEG (electroencephalogram) test is imperative to a diagnosis.",

      "title": "Causes and epidemiology of agitation, confusion, and delirium in the ICU",
      "abstract": "Abstract Confusion is a non-specific, non-diagnostic term to describe a patient with disorientation, impaired memory, or abnormal thought process. Agitation describes an increased level of psychomotor activity, and anxious or aggressive behaviour. Many agitated patients may also be delirious, yet they only represent a minority of all delirious patients. ICU delirium is an acute cognitive disorder of both consciousness and content of thought. The hallmark of ICU delirium is a fluctuating mental status, inattention, and an altered level of consciousness. Delirium is the end product of a sequence of insults and injury that lead to a common measurable manifestation of end-organ brain injury. It does not have a single aetiology, but often has multiple different and potentially interacting aetiologies. Both non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors play important roles in the development of delirium. Importantly, the new onset of delirium should prompt the physician to investigate the underlying cause. Cognitive impairment and age are among the most important non-modifiable risk factors, whereas administration of benzodiazepines is the greatest. The alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine shows promise as a sedative reducing the risk for delirium when compared with benzodiazepines.",

      "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as excessive daytime sleepiness, 'sleep attacks', insomnia, restless legs syndrome and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, are common and provide a challenge to treatment. These sleep symptoms are also described in patients suffering from the sleep/wake disorder, narcolepsy. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) narcolepsy criteria uses a number of markers for diagnosis, of which lack or deficiency of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 levels is a key marker. Hypocretin neurons prominently located in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical nucleus have been proposed to interact with mechanisms involving sleep and arousal. Low hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF have been shown to correlate with hypothalamic hypocretin cell loss in narcolepsy and other forms of hypersomnia; therefore, it has been proposed that degenerative damage to hypocretin neurons (such as in PD) may be detected by low CSF hypocretin-1 concentrations, and may also explain the sleep symptoms experienced by some PD patients. To date, there is mixed conflicting data describing hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF of patients with parkinsonism associated with sleep symptoms, with most studies showing no significant decrease when compared with controls. However, hypocretin-1 CSF deficiency has been shown in some studies to be more prominent in PD patients with sleep symptoms versus those without. Notably, the hypocretin system has been shown not to be selectively disrupted, with one study showing melanin concentrating hormone cell loss in the same patients with hypocretin loss. It is likely that hypocretin deficiency in PD patients occurs secondary to collateral damage caused by the neurodegenerative process involving the hypothalamus. Awareness of narcoleptic events in PD is important for driving related advice, in addition to the possible use of dopamine D3 receptor active agonists.",

      "title": "Degeneration of rapid eye movement sleep circuitry underlies rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder",
      "abstract": "During healthy rapid eye movement sleep, skeletal muscles are actively forced into a state of motor paralysis. However, in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder-a relatively common neurological disorder-this natural process is lost. A lack of motor paralysis (atonia) in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder allows individuals to actively move, which at times can be excessive and violent. At first glance this may sound harmless, but it is not because rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients frequently injure themselves or the person they sleep with. It is hypothesized that the degeneration or dysfunction of the brain stem circuits that control rapid eye movement sleep paralysis is an underlying cause of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. The link between brain stem degeneration and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder stems from the fact that rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder precedes, in the majority (∼80%) of cases, the development of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, which are known to initially cause degeneration in the caudal brain stem structures where rapid eye movement sleep circuits are located. Furthermore, basic science and clinical evidence demonstrate that lesions within the rapid eye movement sleep circuits can induce rapid eye movement sleep-specific motor deficits that are virtually identical to those observed in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. This review examines the evidence that rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is caused by synucleinopathic neurodegeneration of the core brain stem circuits that control healthy rapid eye movement sleep and concludes that rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is not a separate clinical entity from synucleinopathies but, rather, it is the earliest symptom of these disorders. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

Major diagnostic criteria and comparison with other severe and mild cases are discussed.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by dream enactment and complex motor behaviors during rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep atonia loss (rapid eye movement sleep without atonia) during polysomnography. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder may be idiopathic or symptomatic and in both settings is highly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegeneration, especially Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder frequently manifests years to decades prior to overt motor, cognitive, or autonomic impairments as the presenting manifestation of synucleinopathy, along with other subtler prodromal “soft” signs of hyposmia, constipation, and orthostatic hypotension. Between 35% and 91.9% of patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder at a sleep center later develop a defined neurodegenerative disease. Less is known about the long‐term prognosis of community‐dwelling younger patients, especially women, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder associated with antidepressant medications. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are frequently prone to sleep‐related injuries and should be treated to prevent injury with either melatonin 3‐12 mg or clonazepam 0.5‐2.0 mg to limit injury potential. Further evidence‐based studies about rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are greatly needed, both to enable accurate prognostic prediction of end synucleinopathy phenotypes for individual patients and to support the application of symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder as a prodromal synucleinopathy represents a defined time point at which neuroprotective therapies could potentially be applied for the prevention of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",

From the moment clinicians first see patients, they quite naturally notice many things about their motor behavior: body posture, degree of muscle tension, amount of fidgeting or pacing and facial expression. The muscles of the eye and face are innervated by cranial nerves that originate in the brain. Consequently, disturbances in facial or eye muscle functioning provide crucial clues about whether individua's difficulties originate in the nervous system outside the brain or within brain. Neurological soft signs are subtle, lifelong abnormalities in motor and sensory functioning that are likely caused by imperfect embryonic development or minor, early brain injury. “Automatic behavior” refers to rote movement behaviors that are carried out by individuals in an altered state of consciousness.

Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency.

The stereotyped symptomatology characteristic of most degenerative diseases results from neuronal death in specific pathways: pyramidal tract and motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, nigrostriatal dopamine system in Parkinson's disease, posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord in Friedreich's ataxia, etc. This suggests that these neurons are sensitive to pathological processes that are still unknown. Progression of the disease, whether linear or not, is slow, but it is more rapid than similar effects due to ageing. This indicates either that the environmental cause of degeneration (if it exists) is continuously present or that a vital process has been once and for all disrupted, perhaps at the level of the genome, causing insufficient production of essential proteins, or accumulation of eventually toxic metabolites. Symptoms generally appear during adulthood, i.e. after normal differentiation has taken place, and after a considerable number of neurons have already been damaged. The initiation of neuronal death precedes the appearance of the first symptoms.",

This case illustrates the fact that vision problems may also be the first manifestation of a neurodegenerative disorder.A 46-year-old male developed progressive, incapacitating vision problems. Multiple pairs of glasses with lenses of different strengths did not improve symptoms. No ophthalmological explanation of the problems could be found. Oculomotor apraxia and visual extinction were seen on neurological examination. Visuoperceptual impairment was the main finding on neuropsychological examination. Impairment was also identified in visuoconstruction, memory and praxis.Cognitive problems in several areas, interference with activities of daily living, and young age of onset complete the clinical picture of presenile dementia. Posterior cortical atrophy is a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by progressive, incapacitating visuospatial and visuoperceptual impairment.

      "title": "Neurodegeneration in Narcolepsy‐Associated Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder",
      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia associated with increased muscle tone during REM sleep.1 It strongly marks neurodegenerative synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.2 Many narcolepsy patients have RBD symptoms.3 It has been suggested that the pathophysiology of RBD in narcolepsy differs from idiopathic RBD, perhaps being related to the instability of sleep stages. Moreover, patients with narcolepsy show fewer degenerative disease signs.4 This would imply that narcolepsy–RBD should not be associated with neurodegenerative disease. Here we report a patient with narcolepsy who developed neurodegenerative synucleinopathy, albeit with characteristics that seemed to suggest 2 independent pathophysiologies. Our patient developed severe daytime somnolence in adolescence and was clinically diagnosed with narcolepsy. Approximately 10 years later, he developed progressive cataplexy, which caused the ending of his sports career. He also had classic hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations and episodes of sleep paralysis. Since marriage, his wife had noted sleep talking/thrashing during sleep, which was without consequent injury. Multiple sleep latency testing disclosed a mean sleep latency = 5.9 minutes (median = 2.4), with 2 sleep-onset REM periods. A polysomnogram (PSG) in 1965 demonstrated equivocal REM atonia loss, with tonic REM = 20% and phasic REM = 32% chin Electromyography (EMG).5 He had poor sleep efficiency (67%), with an apnea–hypopnea index = 30; for this he received a Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) without any benefit on his somnolence. Cataplexy improved considerably with paroxetine. All of these symptoms were stable for >30 years until the age of 67 when there was a dramatic change in the nature and severity of dream enactment. Dreams became threatening (new for him), and he would respond vigorously. The amplitude of movements increased dramatically with minor injury. He presented again to our center. The polysomnogram demonstrated 46% tonic REM and 58% phasic REM chin EMG. During REM sleep, he moved his arms, had myoclonic jerks, and spoke distinctly in apparent response to dreams (which was not observed on the previous polysomnogram). He underwent a complete evaluation for signs of neurodegenerative synucleinopathy (he was not formally included in our ongoing research cohort because of associated narcolepsy,5 but nevertheless underwent the same protocol). In 2010, Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 24/30 and Mini-Mental State Exam was 26/30, losing points for short-term recall and repetition. He had no cognitive changes at that time. Olfaction was severely decreased (0/12 on the brief University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test). Color vision was profoundly decreased (Farnsworth-Munsell (FM)-100 = 288). There was mild erectile dysfunction (new) with no orthostatic hypotension, urinary dysfunction, and constipation. Motor testing was within the normal range, with Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-II = 1, Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-III = 3, alternate tap test = 189 (normal >1757), Timed Up-and-Go = 6 seconds, and Purdue Pegboard = 12.5 pegs/30 seconds (normal >10.5). During the subsequent 9 years, he developed episodes of vivid hallucinations. His cognition then worsened and progressed through Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia (no clear fluctuations). He was ultimately diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies.6 He also developed episodes of likely non-rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnia (sleep walking and sleep talking with preserved interactivity with environment). Subtle bradykinesia in the hands was noted on the last evaluation. He has had good response to cholinesterase inhibition. Table 1. Narcolepsy is commonly associated with RBD symptoms and is generally considered to be unassociated with neurodegenerative risk. Here, our patient had clear narcolepsy with cataplexy and then an unequivocal change in dream enactment behavior at age 67. Here the systematic documentation of evolution toward neurodegenerative synucleinopathy might have suggested that narcolepsy-associated RBD should be considered a risk factor for neurodegenerative synucleinopathy. In support of this might be the findings of abnormal olfaction documented in idiopathic narcolepsy, a somewhat similar biological signature (ie, increased loss of REM atonia relative to controls) as well as the fact that dream enactment can co-occur with RBD in NREM sleep in both narcolepsy and neurodegenerative synucleinopathy.7 However, elements of the clinical course suggest that narcolepsy in this case should perhaps be better considered a separate problem. Most notable was the relatively discrete and clear change in dream enactment behavior occurring in advanced age, without neurodegenerative symptoms occurring beforehand. After this change, there occurred a classic neurodegenerative evolution indistinguishable from idiopathic RBD.8 This suggests the possibility of a coincidental double hit. Given the profound neurodegenerative implications of idiopathic RBD, what evaluations might be recommended in narcolepsy-associated RBD? To start, there are a series of well-established clinical markers for prodromal Parkinson's disease that can be assessed in an office setting9 (noting that olfaction testing may be less informative in this population). Recent studies have also suggested meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy (an early marker of peripheral cardiac sympathetic denervation), and an examination of skin biopsy for abnormal phosphorylated α-synuclein can help identify prodromal neurodegenerative synucleinopathy.10 In summary, our findings suggest that even if conversion to neurodegeneration is coincidental, and the likelihood of phenoconversion to neurodegeneration is low, evaluation for potential neurodegenerative signs should be considered if clinical features change markedly late in life.

      "title": "PLA2G6-Associated Neurodegeneration",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) comprises a continuum of three phenotypes with overlapping clinical and radiologic features: Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) Atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy (atypical NAD) PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism INAD usually begins between ages six months and three years with psychomotor regression or delay, hypotonia, and progressive spastic tetraparesis. Many affected children never learn to walk or lose the ability shortly after attaining it. Strabismus, nystagmus, and optic atrophy are common. Disease progression is rapid, resulting in severe spasticity, progressive cognitive decline, and visual impairment. Many affected children do not survive beyond their first decade. Atypical NAD shows more phenotypic variability than INAD. In general, onset is in early childhood but can be as late as the end of the second decade. The presenting signs may be gait instability, ataxia, or speech delay and autistic features, which are sometimes the only evidence of disease for a year or more. Strabismus, nystagmus, and optic atrophy are common. Neuropsychiatric disturbances including impulsivity, poor attention span, hyperactivity, and emotional lability are also common. The course is fairly stable during early childhood and resembles static encephalopathy but is followed by neurologic deterioration between ages seven and 12 years. PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism has a variable age of onset, but most individuals present in early adulthood with gait disturbance or neuropsychiatric changes. Affected individuals consistently develop dystonia and parkinsonism (which may be accompanied by rapid cognitive decline) in their late teens to early twenties. Dystonia is most common in the hands and feet but may be more generalized. The most common features of parkinsonism in these individuals are bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in PLA2G6 on molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of INAD or atypical NAD can be established in a proband with no identified PLA2G6 pathogenic variants by electron microscopic examination of nerve biopsies for dystrophic axons (axonal spheroids). Management Treatment of manifestations: Individuals with INAD and atypical NAD. Routine pharmacologic treatment of spasticity and seizures; trial of oral or intrathecal baclofen for dystonia associated with atypical INAD; treatment by a psychiatrist for those with later-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms; fiber supplements and/or stool softener treatment for constipation; control of secretions with transdermal scopolamine patch as needed; feeding modifications as needed to prevent aspiration pneumonia and achieve adequate nutrition. Individuals with PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism. Consider treatment with dopaminergic agents; treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms by a psychiatrist; evaluation by physical therapy for management of postural instability and gait difficulties; occupational therapy to assist with activities of daily living; feeding modifications as needed to prevent aspiration pneumonia and achieve adequate nutrition. Prevention of secondary complications: Early physical therapy and orthopedic management to prevent contractures as the disease progresses; body temperature monitors may be required for individuals with progressive autonomic involvement to identify dangerous fluctuations in core body temperature. Surveillance: Periodic assessment of vision and hearing of nonverbal children is indicated as needed to determine the level of sensory deficits. Genetic counseling PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.",

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS The eyes move to keep the fovea on the object of visual regard. To account for the movement of targets, the environment, or the self, different classes of eye movement are necessary to achieve visual stability. These movements involve the vergence, smooth pursuit, saccadic, vestibular, and optokinetic systems, as well as the ability to suppress the vestibuloocular reflex and other movements for steady fixation. When the equipoise of one or more of these systems is disrupted, nystagmus or saccadic intrusions may result. The astute clinician can distinguish between benign (eg, infantile or peripheral vestibular nystagmus) and dangerous (eg, stroke, Wernicke encephalopathy) etiologies with a high degree of confidence at the bedside, making expensive eye movement recording equipment unnecessary in the majority of cases. ESSENTIAL POINTS The recognition and interpretation of nystagmus and saccadic intrusions in the context of the history and a comprehensive ocular motor and neurologic examination is an essential skill in neurologic practice.",

      "abstract": "Because there are no direct biological markers for the substances implicated in indoor air exposure, it is impossible to directly measure if an individual or group of individuals has been exposed to a potentially neurotoxic substance in the workplace. Behavioral changes may be the earliest and only manifestation of central nervous system (CNS) effects and are often too subtle to be revealed by routine physical or neurological examination. Neuropsychological techniques are sensitive to subtle behavioral/cognitive changes that can result from exposure to neurotoxins. These techniques consist of oral and written tests that are administered by a trained examiner on a one-to-one basis. In general, a wide variety of cognitive domains are evaluated. The typical battery generally includes assessing orientation, attention, intelligence, language, visual memory, verbal memory, perception, visuoconstruction, simple motor speed, psychomotor speed, and mood. As with most assessment techniques, the neuropsychological methods have limitations. One major drawback is the availability of appropriate norms that are used to compare the results of a specific individual. Because these tasks are greatly affected by age, intelligence, and in some instances sex, the availability of appropriate norms is mandatory to determine if the CNS has been effected. Although neuropsychological tests are sensitive to the presence of CNS involvement, they are not specific. Patterns of performance seen with specific instances of neurotoxic exposure may also be seen with a number of other diseases of the CNS such as dementia, cerebrovascular disease, hydrocephalus, or normal aging. In addition, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and/or depression are often manifested as cognitive difficulties that will mimic the cognitive dysfunction seen with toxicity of the CNS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "The potential role of neuropathic mechanisms in dry eye syndromes",
      "abstract": "Dry eye syndromes can involve both nociceptive and neuropathic symptoms. Nociceptive symptoms are the normal physiological responses to noxious stimuli. Neuropathic symptoms are caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system and can be the result of hypersensitisation of peripheral or central corneal and conjunctival somatosensory nerves. For example, inflammation could induce neuroplastic peripheral sensitisation of the ocular surface or lid wiper and exacerbate nociceptive symptoms. Neuropathic symptoms may explain the incommensurate relation between signs and symptoms in some dry eye syndromes although absence of signs of a dry eye syndrome may also be a consequence of inappropriate methods used when examining for them. Involvement of neuropathic mechanisms may also help explain dry eye symptoms which occur in association with reduced corneal sensitivity. This review includes a discussion of the potential for ocular symptoms involving neuropathic mechanisms to contribute to psychosocial problems such as depression, stress, anxiety and sleep disorders as well as for these types of psychosocial problems to contribute to neuropathic mechanisms and dry eye syndromes. Failure to consider the possibility that neuropathic mechanisms can contribute to dry eye syndromes may reduce accuracy of diagnosis and the suitability of treatment provided. Dry eye symptoms in the absence of commensurate evidence of tear dysfunction, and unsatisfactory response to tear dysfunction therapies should prompt consideration of neuropathic mechanisms being involved. Symptoms which persist after local anaesthetic instillation are more likely to be neuropathic in origin. Reducing inflammation may help limit any associated neuroplastic hypersensitivity.",

This review describes the clinical characteristics of PD with emphasis on those features that differentiate the disease from other parkinsonian disorders.A MedLine search was performed to identify studies that assess the clinical characteristics of PD. Search terms included \"Parkinson's disease\", \"diagnosis\" and \"signs and symptoms\".Because there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of PD, the disease must be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of postural reflexes are generally considered the cardinal signs of PD. The presence and specific presentation of these features are used to differentiate PD from related parkinsonian disorders. Other clinical features include secondary motor symptoms (eg, hypomimia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhoea, micrographia, shuffling gait, festination, freezing, dystonia, glabellar reflexes), non-motor symptoms (eg, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep disorders and sensory abnormalities such as anosmia, paresthesias and pain). Absence of rest tremor, early occurrence of gait difficulty, postural instability, dementia, hallucinations, and the presence of dysautonomia, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and other atypical features, coupled with poor or no response to levodopa, suggest diagnoses other than PD.A thorough understanding of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of PD is essential to the proper diagnosis of the disease. Genetic mutations or variants, neuroimaging abnormalities and other tests are potential biomarkers that may improve diagnosis and allow the identification of persons at risk.",

      "abstract": "22q11.2 Deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a chromosomal microdeletion that affects approximately 40 to 50 genes and affects various organs and systems throughout the body. Detection is typically achieved by fluorescence in situ hybridization after diagnosis of one of the major features of the deletion or via chromosomal microarray or noninvasive prenatal testing. The physical phenotype can include congenital heart defects, palatal and pharyngeal anomalies, hypocalcemia/hypoparathyroidism, skeletal abnormalities, and cranial/brain anomalies, although prevalence rates of all these features are variable. Cognitive function is impaired to some degree in most individuals, with prevalence rates of greater than 90% for motor/speech delays and learning disabilities. Attention, executive function, working memory, visual-spatial abilities, motor skills, and social cognition/social skills are affected. The deletion is also associated with an increased risk for behavioral disorders and psychiatric illness. The early onset of psychiatric symptoms common to 22q11.2DS disrupts the development and quality of life of individuals with the syndrome and is also a potential risk factor for later development of a psychotic disorder. This review discusses prevalence, phenotypic features, and management of psychiatric disorders commonly diagnosed in children and adolescents with 22q11.2DS, including autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and schizophrenia/psychotic disorders. Guidelines for the clinical assessment and management of psychiatric disorders in youth with this syndrome are provided, as are treatment guidelines for the use of psychiatric medications.",

      "abstract": "The classification of benign partial epilepsies and related conditions includes (besides rolandic epilepsy) atypical benign partial epilepsy, bioelectrical status epilepticus (ESES) and a variety of other syndromes. The broad overlap of the clinical and bioelectrical symptomatology might reflect a pathogenetic background common to these epilepsies. In order to understand the great phenotypic variability, the clinical symptomatology in 56 sibships with focal sharp waves of genetic origin was analyzed. A genetic determination was assumed if, in addition to the index case, at least one sibling or offspring revealed typical focal sharp waves. The 56 index-cases and their 61 sib/offspring/parents showed a broad spectrum of epileptic and non-epileptic conditions ranging from mild selective performance deficits to severe complex mental retardation, from neonatal seizures, febrile convulsions, and simple rolandic epilepsy to severe epilepsies with minor seizures or ESES. The different conditions are not disease entities but sets of variably weighted symptoms of a complex pathogenetic background, in which a genetic disposition to focal anomalies of brain function is of decisive importance. As can be demonstrated by the data, this genetic liability coincides with other widespread genetic traits, expressed in certain EEG patterns, as well as with lesional pathogenetic factors. The biological background of the genetic focal anomaly is currently unknown. The marked age dependence of the symptoms justifies the assumption of an hereditary impairment of brain maturation.",

      "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment is a condition in which a person experiences a slight but noticeable decline in mental abilities compared with others of the same age. The minor decline in abilities is noticeable by the person experiencing them or by others who interact with the person, but the changes are not severe enough to interfere with normal daily life and activities. Some gradual mental decline is seen with normal aging. For example, the ability to learn new information may be reduced, mental processing slows, speed of performance slows, and ability to become distracted increases. However, these declines due to normal aging do not affect overall functioning or ability to perform activities of daily living.",

      "title": "Early Markers for Cerebral Palsy",
      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a term referring to a nonprogressive disease of the brain originating during the antenatal, neonatal, or early postnatal period when brain neuronal connections are still evolving. Secondary effects of spasticity on growth may, however, be progressive. There may be additional disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and behavior. Babies who are neurologically abnormal as newborns are at increased risk of neurologic abnormality in later months and years. Being born preterm (born &lt;37 weeks of gestation) or with a very low birth weight (weighing &lt;1500 g/&lt;32 weeks of gestation) or extreme low birth weight (&lt;1000 g/&lt;28 weeks of gestation) is associated with significant motor impairment. Which specific signs in the neonate are of greatest predictive power, what long-term disability these signs predict, and how well they predict it remain unclear? Physician’s major concern is to identify specific risk factors for severe impairment in early infancy so as to predict the developmental outcome of those children that may manifest later on with neurological deficit especially if they have perinatal insult. Parents on the other hand are also concerned about their growing infants, their development, and neurological outcome. Since cerebral palsy is a permanent disorder, early detection of signs of motor impairment is crucial to assist physicians to give close follow-up of those infants and to reassure parents whose children are normal. It has been shown that intervention may be most efficient when the plasticity of the brain is high, and an early detection of brain impairment is therefore crucial. An earlier follow-up and training program can have a positive effect of the motor development of the child with CP, in particular through prevention of limb contractions, and might make a difference in the child’s ability to handle everyday challenges. In addition, an early detection of CP gives the parents more time for adjustment and preparation. Since clinical manifestations of cerebral palsy do not emerge before a child is at least 6 months, the general movement (GM) is considered the most reliable early markers for monitoring of fetal and infant movement. Abnormal General movements and absence of the so-called fidgety movements at 3-5 months post-term carries a high risk of developing cerebral palsy. Beside a high specificity (82–99%) and sensitivity (95–100%), the assessment of the general movements (GMs) is quick, nonintrusive, and easy to acquire.",

      "abstract": "Insight into the normal function of the fetal brain as well as the prenatal detect of disorder, is enabled by general movement assessment. Spontaneously generated movements are movements of the fetus and the young infant, which are manifested by age-specific characteristics in two ages: writhing age and fidgety age. We distinguish normal repertoire and three types of abnormal general movements which are: poor, cramped-synchronized and chaotic general movements. Researches showed that predictive strength is the best at fidgety age, from 2 to 4 months of life, and that abnormality of movement in 95% of infants indicates cerebral palsy or other disorders. According to the type of movement can be predicted the type of later neurological outcomes of the child, and therefore, for example, abnormal general movements or the absence of general movements point to cerebral palsy, and mildly abnormal general movements, if not indicative for cerebral palsy, may be indicative for development of attention disorder and hyperactivity, minor neurological dysfunction or aggressive behavior. The main aim of this study was to describe the age-specific characteristics of the general movements in toddler at writhing age. Another aim was to examine the frequency and type of movement at fidgety age tracking the trajectory of the child without risk. The criterion for selecting the participant of this study was that the participant is a newborn from a regular pregnancy without any factors of risk. The participant is a male newborn, born in 41 week, 5 days after term from a regular pregnancy and without any factors of risk. The study used the observation as a method that is performed by analyzing video tapes recorded in certain weeks. For the purposes of research, three tables for tracking the child's movements were raised; 1) movement optimality score from detailed assessment of general movements at writhing age, 2) the occurrence and frequency of specific movements towards the central line at fidgety age, and 3) the individual trajectory of the child's development. The results of the study indicate that the infant showed a poor repertoire of general movements in writhing age, which over time changed and, through the fidgety age, proved to be a normal repertoire. According to researches, such a change is not infrequent in toddlers so this study is still showing us an insight into the typical development in toddler, as was the effort of this research.",

      "abstract": "Although the majority of epileptics who are well controlled on medication do not show significant evidence of psychopathology, a subset of epileptics have serious psychiatric disturbances. Risk factors for the development of psychopathology appear to include poorly-controlled seizures, a long duration of seizure disorder with onset in childhood, seizure focus in the temporal lobe, bilateral or multiple discharges on EEG, and structural lesions. All of these factors appear to put the patient at greater risk of brain dysfunction, possibly because of the disruption of limbic functions associated with behavior and personality. The onset of seizures in childhood is likely to affect the development of personality and social functioning adversely. Although not a focus of this article, premorbid personality, psychologic reactions to having epilepsy, and the social problems accompanying the disease are likely to contribute greatly to the development of psychopathology. The development of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy thus appears to be a complex, multifactorial process. No single factor, such as seizure type, EEG findings, lateralization, pathology, or demographic variables is likely to be explanatory. Recent research has focused on accounting for many of these factors, and future investigations should shed further light on why some epileptics develop psychiatric problems and how best to treat these disorders.",

Primary insomniacs have a good response to hypnotics, but feel out of control if they use them continuously. Two components are involved in maintaining the insomnia - a psychological anxiety and a physiological response to this anxiety, including raised muscle tone and respiratory rate. A behavioural regimen based on a cognitive-behavioural approach designed to improve sleep quality gradually over a period of 4 - 6 weeks is often helpful. A hypnotic can be prescribed for use every third night during this regimen - zolpidem and zopiclone are preferred. Referral to a sleep specialist may be necessary if this approach does not work.",

Idiopathic RBD occurs in the absence of any neurological disease or other possible cause, is male-predominant and its clinical course is generally chronic progressive. Secondary RBD may be related to neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. Recent long-term prospective studies have shown that 30% to 65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disorder with the rate of emergence depending on the length of the follow-up period. RBD may therefore be one of the earliest signs of and/or a long-term predictor for neurodegenerative disorders. Because RBD antecedes the development of these disorders by several years or decades, its recognition may enable the delay or prevention of neurodegenerative disorders through the early application of neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapies in the future.",

      "abstract": "Optic neuritis is a term used to refer to inflammation of the optic nerve. When it is associated with a swollen optic disc, it is called papillitis or anterior optic neuritis1. When the optic disc appears normal, the term retrobulbar optic neuritis or retrobulbar neuritis are used. In the absence of signs of multiple sclerosis or other systemic disease, the term optic neuritis refers to isolated, monosymptomatic, or idiopathic. It is likely that most cases of isolated acute optic neuritis are a forme fruste of multiple sclerosis. Patients in whom optic neuritis occurs as an isolated phenomenon have a higher risk of developing multiple sclerosis at a later date than the normal population. Optic neuritis is also a part of the demyelinating syndrome called neuromyelitis optica or “Devic’s disease”. \r\nOBJECTIVE \r\nThis is a prospective and retrospective study done to evaluate the factors influencing the visual outcome of optic neuritis. \r\nThe objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of risk factors and the treatment given on the visual outcome of optic neuritis. \r\nMETHODOLOGY (MATERIALS AND METHODS) \r\nSubject Selection: \r\nAll patients diagnosed as optic neuritis in RIO-GOH during May 2010 to May 2012 were included in the study. \r\nInclusion criteria: \r\nAll patients diagnosed as optic neuritis were studied. \r\nExclusion criteria: \r\nThe following patients were excluded from the study \r\n\t1) Patients with Anterior Ischemic optic neuropathy \r\n\t2) Patients with traumatic optic neuropathy \r\nConclusion:\r\n\tFemales were predominantly affected than males in the ratio of 3:1. \r\n\tMost common affected patients were in the age group of 30-50 yrs. Recurrent cases included 10% of the patients. Recurrence was more common in the same eye. No specific association with any etiological factor was noted. \r\n\tAlmost all patients had defective vision. Around 25% had complaints of defective colour vision, defective field of vision and 60% had ocular pain. \r\n\tBilateral cases were around 18%. They were more common in children. \r\n\tFever was more common in children and more commonly associated with bilateral optic neuritis. \r\n\tVisual acuity at the time of presentation was 6/60 – 6/36. In all the patients pupillary reaction was abnormal. Colour vision was abnormal in 75% of patients. Contrast sensitivity was abnormal in all patients. \r\n\tField defect was always noted in all patients most common was central scotoma. \r\n\tRetrobulbar neuritis was noted in 28% of patients. Other patients had optic neuritis. Most commonly disc oedema was noted. Rarely haemorrhage was noted. \r\n\tAfter ONTT almost all patients showed improvement in vision. This improvement of vision is statistically significant. \r\n\tColour vision recovery was noted in 46% after three months of follow up. \r\n\tFields showed persistent field defect after three months in the patients. \r\n\tInstitution of ONTT has definite role in speeding up of recovery.",

      "abstract": "At least three types of ictal atomic phenomena can be seen in partial seizures. Focal atomic seizures are partial seizures with ictal paresis or paralysis of one or more body parts preceding or independent of any convulsive activity. A diagnosis may be difficult without simultaneous EEG recording supplemented by video monitoring or polygraphy. Epileptic negative myoclonus manifests as brief lapses in tone in one or more muscle groups that interferes with motor coordination and postural control. Drop attacks can also occur in partial seizures, as have been well documented in patients with temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy. Different mechanisms may underlie these three phenomena. Focal atonic seizures probably result from relatively circumscribed seizure activity in one or more cortical areas that contribute to the elaboration and execution of motor functions. Whether this represents inactivation or interference in motor integration, or activation of inhibitory system, remains unresolved. The pathophysiology of epileptic negative myoclonus, like that of its positive counterpart, is probably to be found at a more local level, possibly from transiently enhanced local inhibition in the motor cortex. Drop attacks in partial seizures may be close in mechanism to that also seen in generalized seizures, possibly related to ictal activation of descending inhibitory pathways in the brainstem.",

      "abstract": "About one third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience hallucinations, mostly of a complex visual type, less often auditory or tactile. Minor hallucinatory phenomena, including sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions are frequent. Hallucinations primarily occur in a context of clear sensorium in patients with longstanding PD. They are more frequent in the evening or during the night. Insight in the hallucinatory nature of the phenomenon may be retained, partial, fluctuating, or abolished. An altered insight is common when cognitive impairment is present, and may be associated with delusions and (or) delusional misidentifications. Pharmacological factors such as dopaminergic treatment clearly trigger or increase the occurence of hallucinations in PD. However, in the recent years, emphasis has been made on disease-related factors including cognitive impairment, diurnal somnolence, visual disorders (either contrast and color discrimination impairment due to PD, or coincident ocular disorders), long duration of PD, late onset, severe axial impairment and autonomic dysfunction. The pathophysiology of hallucinations of PD is poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial. The first steps of the treatment consist in giving information and reassurance to the patient and his/her caregiver, re-evaluating the antiparkinsonian treatment and associated medications, and evaluating the patient for mood disorder, visual impairment, and cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors, when prescribed for associated cognitive impairment, may be beneficial on hallucinations. In the more severe forms, clozapine has been proved to be safe and effective.",

This disturbance may be the result of underlying organic disease of the brain, either fixed or progressive, or it may be an indication of a functional disturbance related to a circulatory or metabolic disorder. The first attack may be so mild that the child is unaffected but subsequent attacks may be prolonged, or result in status epilepicus, and produce a mild or severe degree of mental impairment. There is considerable evidence to indicate that anoxia associated with convulsions can cause brain damage and for this reason every child who has had a convulsion should be investigated and, with rare exception, placed on prophylactic daily anticonvulsant medication when no specific treatable condition is discovered. EVALUATION The first step in the study of a child who has a convulsion is to document its occurrence. Anxious parents are, as a rule, poor witnesses. Despite this, every effort should be made to obtain a description of the seizure, particularly premonitory symptoms, loss of consciousness, convulsive movements, duration of the attack, and the state of the patient following the attack. In infants breath-holding spells may simulate convulsive seizures. In breath-holding spells there is always a precipitating factor, usually a slight injury or some emotional disturbance which results in violent crying, ending suddenly in respiratory apnea. The cyanosis in such attacks appears before the loss of consciousness and convulsive movements.",

      "title": "Mild cognitive impairment",
      "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndrome that spans the area between normal ageing and dementia. It is classified into amnestic and non-amnestic types, both with two subtypes: single domain and multiple domains. Prevalence of MCI depends on criteria and population and can vary from 0.1 to 42% persons of older age. In contrast to dementia, cognitive deterioration is less severe and activities of daily living are preserved. Most impaired higher cognitive functions in MCI are memory, executive functions, language, visuospatial functions, attention etc. Also there are depression, apathy or psychomotor agitation, and signs of psychosis. Aetiology of MCI is multiple, mostly neurodegenerative, vascular, psychiatric, internistic, neurological, traumatic and iatrogenic. Persons with amnestic MCI are at a higher risk of converting to Alzheimer's disease, while those with a single non-memory domain are at risk of developing frontotemporal dementia. Some MCI patients also progress to other dementia types, vascular among others. In contrast, some patients have a stationary course, some improve, while others even normalize. Every suspicion of MCI warrants a detailed clinical exploration to discover underlying aetiology, laboratory analyses, neuroimaging methods and some cases require a detailed neuropsychological assessment. At the present time there is no efficacious therapy for cognitive decline in MCI or the one that could postpone conversion to dementia. The treatment of curable causes, application of preventive measures and risk factor control are reasonable measures in the absence of specific therapy.",

Dementia due to vascular diseases is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and 28 to 36 million people worldwide with dementia are undiagnosed1. Vascular Dementia is characterized by distinct aspects of impaired consciousness and such an impairment is indexed by declined performances at controlled cognitive tasks. It is related to reduced brain metabolic activity in a network of frontal, posterior associative, and limbic regions due to the occurrence of multiple mini/major strokes or other conditions that affect blood vessels and nerve fibres deep inside the brain. Diagnosis of Vascular dementia in its preliminary stages is a very complex task as it requires screening, Neuro-cognitive testing, and brain imaging evidence usually CT Scan or MRI. Sometimes cause of mild impairment cannot be diagnosed by brain Imaging. EEG based diagnostic approaches are promising tool in case of differentiating diverse types of dementia. Portable EEG with its high temporal resolution property is an economical solution for the many undiagnosed people with dementia in the low and middle income countries. This paper reviews EEG analysis approaches to diagnose vascular mild impairment and dementia as a future diagnostic tool in the healthcare sector.",

      "abstract": "1999).The LSD can be classified in sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, mucolipidoses, lipid storage disease, glycogen storage disease type II and lysosomal transport defects.Different LSD displayed different symptoms severity and different age onset and it depend on the organs affected and the residual enzyme activity.Generally, mutation leaving very low residual enzyme activity cause the most severe onset form of the pathologies; contrary higher residual enzyme activity delays disease onset (Kolter & Sandhoff, 1999).The disease course and severity are different in late-onset forms and can be variable even among affected siblings in the same family (Zhao & Grabowski, 2002).LSDs are often multisystemic disorders and many of these displayed a severe, progressive and untreatable neurological impairment.Almost all LSDs are related to devastating, progressive and untreatable effects on central nervous system (CNS).Neuronal loss occurs in the advanced stages of the diseases and is due to apoptosis or necrosis.The neurological symptoms are mental retardation, progressive neurodegeneration, dementia.Most LSDs show CNS involvment althought the undegraded material concentration is lower in the brain than in other organs.It seems that neurons are more vulnerable than other cellular type probably for a limited cell regeneration potential or for the absence of compensatory pathways (Bellettato & Scarpa, 2010).The Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are lysosomal storage diseases affecting the CNS, with progressive loss of vision, decreasing cognitive and motor skills, epileptic seizures and premature death, with dementia without visual loss prominent in the rarer adult forms (Kohan et al., 2011).GM1 type 3 Gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by βgalactosidase deficiency, patients were recently found to be affected by generalized dystonia associated to akinetic-rigid parkinsonism (Roze et al., 2005).The San Filippo Syndrome type B is a LSDs due to mutation in the gene encoding -N-acetylglucosaminidase with an accumulation of heparan sulfate.Affected children shown mental retardation, dementia, behavior problems.The analysis of mutant mice showed cytoplasmic inclusion of P-tau aggregates, characteristic of tauopathies, a group of age-related dementia that include Alzheimer disease (Ohmi et al., 2009).In some adult neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington' s disease the clical features are similar to those found in LSDs: accumulation of undegraded material, abnormal inflammatory response in the brain and changes in neurons morphology and functionality (Bellettato et al., 2010).In Parkinson's disease was found an involvement of cathepsin D, a lysosomal enzyme, in -synuclein degradation and formation of carboxy-terminally truncated -synuclein.Recent works suggest that impaired cathepsin D activity would result in incresed a-synuclein levels that cause its aggregation (Sevlever et al., 2008).In Huntington's disease N-terminal mutant huntingtin fragments form inclusions that lead to cell death.Some protease, like cathepsin D, B and L, help to degrade mutant huntingtin but increase N-terminal fragment formation and inclusions deposition inducing neuronal disruption (Kim et al., 2006). Gaucher's disease: An overviewGaucher's disease (GD) is an inherited autosomal recessive metabolic disorder, resulting from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (also called acid βglucosidase, GCase) (EC 3.2.1.45).GD was first described as a systemic disease by Philippe Gaucher in 1882, but only in 1965 this disorder was related to the deficiency of β-glucocerebrosidase (Patrick, 1965; Brady et al.",

      "title": "Ave Maria and Visions of Children: Atypical Charles Bonnet Syndrome or Two Coexisting Deafferentation Phenomena?",
      "abstract": "Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) refers to the experience of visual hallucinations in the context of visual impairment. The underlying pathology may be localized anywhere along the visual pathway from the eye itself to visual cortical centers. It is sometimes compared to phantom limb syndrome; both involve decreased sensory input, as in loss of a limb or declining vision, resulting in overactivity in areas of the brain controlling sensory perception. Definitive diagnostic criteria are still lacking and may vary by discipline. However, the following features are generally agreed upon: visual hallucinations, impaired vision, and intact cognition and insight. Psychiatric symptoms, cognitive decline, and hallucinations of other sensory modalities are often excluded, although this remains an area of debate. Certain non-classic cases of CBS have inspired the designation of atypical CBS, which encompasses a wide spectrum of sensory experiences and associated symptoms. Auditory hallucinations in the hearing-impaired, a well-described phenomenon thought to have a similar pathogenesis, share with CBS the important risk factor of increased age. In patients experiencing both types of hallucinations with deterioration in both sensory domains, the distinction between a CBS variant and two independent processes may not be straightforward. In addition to the ongoing diagnostic dilemma posed by multimodal hallucinations, these phenomena tend to be underreported by patients likely due to concern that they will be diagnosed with mental illness. Although many patients with this condition are indifferent to it, some suffer distress from their hallucinations and would benefit from recognition, reassurance, and in some cases correction of the underlying cause or pharmacologic treatment. Here we present the case of an elderly woman with a history of macular degeneration and chronic hearing loss who experienced complex auditory and visual hallucinations surrounding an episode of severe anxiety. We postulate that her anxiety acted as a precipitant to her hallucinatory experiences and may partially explain their abrupt onset in the absence of other clear pathologic processes. This case serves to reinforce CBS as a possible etiology of visual hallucinations in the elderly population, while also generating discussion of how to classify her particular set of symptoms.",

Primitive reflexes develop in the womb, are present at birth in the full-term neonate. Postural reflexes emerge after birth and take up to three and a half years to be fully developed. Collectively, abnormality in the profile of these two groups of reflexes provides indications of neurological dysfunction or neurological immaturity. Spinal reflexes function at the base of the hierarchical control system. A weak or absent Moro reflex is seen in cases of upper motor neuron lesions; an asymmetrical Moro reflex at birth may indicate a fractured clavicle or an Erb's palsy. The fear paralysis reflex is a highly alert but immobile state involving one or several following physical changes.",

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

Visual functions include high contrast visual acuity, low contrast visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, Vernier acuity, mesopic vision, stereopsis, motion perception, and vergence eye movements are all affected in PD patients, with FOG patients having more deficits in some of these functions. FOG patients also had larger impairments in non-dopaminergic mediated functions such as pupil light reflex and visual processing speed test, which suggests that FOG patients have greater impairment in two functions that involve cholinergic neurotransmitters. Whether these impairments are contributing to the FOG or just associated with FOG is uncertain.",

      "abstract": "The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of neurodegenerative diseases refers to an early clinical phase of the disease in which a change has been observed in an individual's cognition or behavior but the person is generally able to maintain independent functioning in daily activities with minimal aids or assistance. At an early stage of most neurodegenerative diseases, including the Frontotemporal Dementias, it can be very difficult to determine whether a person has symptoms of a progressive illness or is suffering from a condition less likely to progress, or even exhibiting symptoms consistent with normal aging. It is critical to identify individuals with MCI, since people with this clinical syndrome are at elevated risk of progressive cognitive decline. In the case of Primary Progressive Aphasia, a neurodegenerative disease in which speech and/or language abilities are gradually lost, a speech-language pathologist (SLP) may be one of the initial clinical providers in the MCI stage. The SLP is therefore critical in helping to determine whether a change in language abilities is a result of normal aging, a neurodegenerative process, or other etiologies.",

      "abstract": "Depressive disorders are commonly associated with sleep disturbances including insomnia, hypersomnia, and nightmares. Based on shared neurobiological mechanisms, a bidirectional link exists between sleep disturbances and depressive disorders. Presence of sleep disturbance is not only associated with increased depression severity but also portends a poorer prognosis with increased suicide risk in patients with depressive disorders. Polysomnographic findings such as reduced slow-wave sleep, decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency and increased REM density are associated with major depression. Comorbid primary sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and circadian rhythm disorders not only increase the risk but also complicate the treatment of major depression. It is imperative to comprehensively assess and treat sleep disturbances, either due to depression or due to co-existing primary sleep disorders, to optimize remission, prevent relapse, and reduce the risk of suicide in patients with depressive disorders. Medications, chronotherapies, and behavioral approaches alone or in combination may prove to be effective in treating sleep disturbances associated with depressive disorders; however, more research is warranted in this area to determine the optimal management strategies. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, a promising treatment for management of insomnia comorbid with major depression, needs wider implementation and more research to establish its efficacy in preventing suicide.",

      "title": "Non‐motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Although still considered a paradigmatic movement disorder, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with a broad spectrum of non‐motor symptoms. These include disorders of mood and affect with apathy, anhedonia and depression, cognitive dysfunction and hallucinosis, as well as complex behavioural disorders. Sensory dysfunction with hyposmia or pain is almost universal, as are disturbances of sleep–wake cycle regulation. Autonomic dysfunction including orthostatic hypotension, urogenital dysfunction and constipation is also present to some degree in a majority of patients. Whilst overall non‐motor symptoms become increasingly prevalent with advancing disease, many of them can also antedate the first occurrence of motor signs – most notably depression, hyposmia or rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). Although exact clinicopathological correlations for most of these non‐motor features are still poorly understood, the occurrence of constipation, RBD or hyposmia prior to the onset of clinically overt motor dysfunction would appear consistent with the ascending hypothesis of PD pathology proposed by Braak and colleagues. Screening these early non‐motor features might, therefore, be one approach towards early ‘preclinical’ diagnosis of PD. This review article provides an overview of the clinical spectrum of non‐motor symptoms in PD together with a brief review of treatment options.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics The 17q12 recurrent duplication is characterized by intellectual abilities ranging from normal to severe disability and other variable clinical manifestations. Speech delay is common, and most affected individuals have some degree of hypotonia and gross motor delay. Behavioral and psychiatric conditions reported in some affected individuals include autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and behavioral abnormalities (aggression and self-injury). Seizures are present in 75%. Additional common findings include microcephaly, ocular abnormalities, and endocrine abnormalities. Short stature and renal and cardiac abnormalities are also reported in some individuals. Penetrance is incomplete and clinical findings are variable. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by detection of the 1.4-megabase heterozygous recurrent duplication at chromosome 17q12 by chromosomal microarray testing or other genomic methods. Management Treatment of manifestations: Those with developmental delays, cognitive disability, and/or behavioral problems should be evaluated by a neurodevelopmental pediatrician or clinical psychologist/psychiatrist. Seizures should be managed by a neurologist using standard practice. Feeding therapy as needed. Individuals with vision, endocrine, cardiac, and/or renal abnormalities should be managed by the appropriate specialist. Surveillance: Regular assessment of psychomotor development is recommended for all children with the 17q12 recurrent duplication as well as psychological evaluation in both affected children and adults. Monitor for new-onset seizures, growth and nutritional assessment, and assessment of family needs at each visit. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment is warranted in at-risk relatives to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from close assessment/monitoring of developmental milestones in childhood or psychological assessment/intervention through adulthood. Genetic counseling The 17q12 recurrent duplication is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with approximately 10% of duplications occurring de novo and approximately 90% inherited from a parent who is often minimally affected or phenotypically normal. Prenatal testing for an at-risk pregnancy requires prior identification of the duplication in an affected family member. Interpretation of results from prenatal testing is challenging given the inherent difficulty in accurately predicting the phenotype.",

      "title": "Mitochondrial DNA-Associated Leigh Syndrome and NARP",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP (neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa) are part of a continuum of progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormalities of mitochondrial energy generation. Leigh syndrome (or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is characterized by onset of symptoms typically between ages three and 12 months, often following a viral infection. Decompensation (often with elevated lactate levels in blood and/or CSF) during an intercurrent illness is typically associated with psychomotor retardation or regression. Neurologic features include hypotonia, spasticity, movement disorders (including chorea), cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Extraneurologic manifestations may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. About 50% of affected individuals die by age three years, most often as a result of respiratory or cardiac failure. NARP is characterized by proximal neurogenic muscle weakness with sensory neuropathy, ataxia, and pigmentary retinopathy. Onset of symptoms, particularly ataxia and learning difficulties, is often in early childhood. Individuals with NARP can be relatively stable for many years, but may suffer episodic deterioration, often in association with viral illnesses. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome is established clinically in a proband with progressive neurologic disease with motor and intellectual developmental delay, signs and symptoms of brain stem and/or basal ganglia disease, raised lactate concentration in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid, and any one of the following: Characteristic features on brain imaging Typical neuropathologic changes Typical neuropathology in a similarly affected sib Identification of a pathogenic variant in one of the 14 mitochondrial genes known to be involved in mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome confirms the diagnosis. The diagnosis of NARP is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and identification of a heteroplasmic pathogenic variant in one of the three mitochondrial genes known to be involved in NARP. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive treatment includes use of sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate for acute exacerbations of acidosis and anti-seizure medication for seizures. Dystonia is treated with benzhexol, baclofen, tetrabenazine, and gabapentin alone or in combination, or by injections of botulinum toxin. Anticongestive therapy may be required for cardiomyopathy. Regular nutritional assessment of daily caloric intake and adequacy of diet and psychological support for the affected individual and family are essential. Surveillance: Neurologic, ophthalmologic, and cardiologic evaluations at regular intervals to monitor progression and appearance of new symptoms. Care is frequently coordinated by a biochemical geneticist in North America, and by a metabolic physician/pediatrician elsewhere in the world. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sodium valproate and barbiturates, anesthesia, and dichloroacetate. Genetic counseling Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP are transmitted by maternal inheritance. The father of a proband is not at risk of having the mtDNA pathogenic variant. The mother of a proband usually has the mtDNA pathogenic variant and may or may not have symptoms. In most cases, the mother has a much lower proportion of abnormal mtDNA than the proband and usually remains asymptomatic or develops only mild symptoms. Occasionally the mother has a substantial proportion of abnormal mtDNA and develops severe symptoms in adulthood. Offspring of males with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are not at risk; all offspring of females with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are at risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. The risk to offspring of a female proband of developing symptoms depends on the tissue distribution and proportion of abnormal mtDNA. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for couples at increased risk of having children with mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome or NARP are possible by analysis of mtDNA extracted from non-cultured fetal cells or from single blastomeres, respectively. However, long-term outcome cannot be reliably predicted on the basis of molecular genetic test results.",

Psychiatrists see such patients in liaison settings and clinics for those with psychotic and affective disorders. The pathophysiology remains obscure; physical investigations are usually performed to exclude pathology rather than elucidate dysfunction. However, modern neuroimaging has allowed the study of nervous system structure and function. Although there are few diagnostically specific findings, patterns of association have emerged: where action is impeded (certain forms of conversion disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome) frontal systems of the brain are often implicated; when subjective awareness of the body is disturbed (passivity phenomena and anorexia nervosa) temporo-parietal cortices appear to be dysfunctional. The caudate nuclei (components of the frontal executive circuit) are implicated in a variety of syndromes (including body dysmorphic disorder, somatisation and chronic fatigue). The brain may be viewed as a cognitive neurobiological entity, crucially oriented towards action (for survival). Psychiatric syndromes that have an impact on bodily awareness signal dysfunction within systems representing that body and its performance in time and space.",

We propose the following diagnostic criteria for PD, i.e., clinical criteria (resting tremor or at least two of the remaining cardinal features of PD), treatment criteria (good response to anti-parkinson drugs), image criteria (essentially normal cerebral MRI), and exclusion criteria (no history of encephalitis or exposure to parkinsonism-inducing substances or drugs).

Estimates on the prevalence of dementia in this disorder are quite variable, ranging from 15 to 25%. Advanced age, depression, severity of akinesia, and the presence of dopaminomimetic psychosis, are considered as risk factors in the development of cognitive deterioration within this patient population. Cognitive dysfunction may manifest as relatively circumscribed deficits or overt dementia. The finding of mild cognitive deficits is common in Parkinson's disease, such as reduced flexibility, psychomotor slowing, reduction in learning capacity and information retrieval, and disturbances in visuospatial tasks. The most prevalent cognitive disturbance is an impairment in visuospatial tasks, not necessarily related to the degree of motor disability. Dementia, when present early on in the course of the disease may suggest alternative diagnoses (Diffuse Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer's disease with extrapyramidal features, Fronto-temporal dementia, etc.), while in those cases in whom the dementing disorder develops at a later stage, it is assumed to be an integral part of the disease, albeit corresponding to variable pathogenetic mechanisms.",

Peripheral neuropathy is also a major cause of disability in uremic subjects. It is believed that aluminum contributes to the pathogenesis of dialysis dementia. Biochemically, brain calcium is elevated in patients with renal failure, probably because of actions of parathyroid hormone on the brain. The diagnosis of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, intellectual dysfunction, dialysis dementia, and uremic neuropathy can be made by the characteristic clinical pictures of these syndromes and the exclusion of other causes of nervous system dysfunction.",

I question whether encephalopathy or delirium is the best description.

The low median age of 43 years makes prior brain disease such as Alzheimer disease and stroke unlikely in most subjects. Figure 2 demonstrates great fluctuation in neuropsychological dysfunction.1 The second CAM cardinal feature is inattention. Twenty-one patients had impaired working memory. We can safely infer that almost all 21 had inattention; 10 patients with stupor or coma had inattention. Thus the first 2 cardinal features of delirium were fulfilled in an estimated 30 patients. CAM positivity requires disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness. Ten had altered level of consciousness and many of the 24 patients whose Mini-Mental State Examination fell below 28 or the 5 who developed agitation would likely have disorganized thinking. I estimate 50% of these patients had CAM-positive delirium. In 584 key articles on delirium, this is the first report of delirium in adults with hemolytic uremic syndrome.",

This disorder is characterized by early onset, the association of hyperactive and poorly coordinated behavior with marked inattention and lack of perseverance in performing tasks; and this behavior occurs in all situations and persists over time. This disorder is inappropriate for the child’s developmental age and maladaptive. Disorders of neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain with discrete neurological changes can lead to behavioral difficulties and other psychological problems. Most children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have comorbidities, often multiple comorbid conditions in the same person. Comorbidity was observed in both clinical and epidemiological samples. It is estimated that about two-thirds of children with this disorder have at least one other psychiatric disorder diagnosed. Symptoms persist and lead to significant difficulties in the daily functioning of the child, such as school success, social interactions, family and social functioning, etc. Recent studies indicate the presence of various neuroophthalmological disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD.

      "abstract": "Autonomic failure with orthostatic and postprandial hypotension, bowel and bladder disturbances, and sexual dysfunction are frequent, disabling features in patients with the three most prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorders: Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy (MSA), and the related neurodegenerative Lewy-body disorder characterized by isolated severe autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, PAF). All of these disorders have in common the presence of α-synuclein in the cytoplasmic precipitates found in neurons in Lewy body disorders or glia in MSA. Autonomic failure with disabling orthostatic hypotension is the clinical hallmark of PAF. It may also be the initial presentation of MSA, making diagnosis difficult. Within a few years, however, MSA patients develop movement disorders, which are differentiated from PD by the paucity of unilateral resting tremor, the lack of response to levodopa, and their rapidly progressive nature, resulting in disability and death in 7 to 8 years. Moderately effective treatment is available for autonomic symptoms, but management of movement disorders remains unsuccessful. Discoveries relevant to physiology and common pathological conditions were initially made in patients with autonomic failure. Meals induce profound hypotension in these patients. Conversely, commonly used nasal decongestants can produce substantial pressor effects. Even 500 mL of water can increase blood pressure by a previously unrecognized sympathetic reflex. Residual sympathetic tone is able to induce sustained supine hypertension in MSA, because it is resolved after ganglionic blockade. These phenomena were not previously recognized because of the buffering capacity of the baroreflex, but were unmasked in autonomic failure patients.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia in Late Life: Findings Challenge Traditional Concepts",
      "abstract": "Two notions about schizophrenia have persisted: (1) it is characterized by onset in adolescence or early adulthood, and (2) it has a progressively deteriorating course. Recent studies focusing on early-adulthood- and middle-age-onset schizophrenia challenge these views. Patients with early-onset schizophrenia and middle-age-onset schizophrenia (MAOS) are similar in terms of family history of schizophrenia, presence of minor physical anomalies, early childhood maladjustment, severity of positive symptoms, presence of gross structural abnormalities on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, overall pattern of neuropsychologic deficits, and qualitative response to neuroleptic medications. Differences include a higher proportion of women among MAOS patients, and the tendency for MAOS patients to have less severe negative symptoms, better neuropsychologic performance (particularly in learning and abstraction/cognitive flexibility), and possibly larger thalamic volume and to respond to lower doses of neuroleptic medications. While onset of schizophrenia-like symptoms in very late life may reflect an acquired condition that is not \"true schizophrenia,\" and that may be labeled \"very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis,\" findings suggest that true schizophrenia can arise after early adulthood. Middle-age-onset schizophrenia is predominantly neurodevelopmental, but it is also a distinct neurobiological subtype of schizophrenia. Our studies also demonstrate that neuropsychologic functioning remains stable in chronic schizophrenia outpatients, even when observed over several years and in the presence of significant fluctuations in the severity of clinical symptoms.",

      "title": "GRIN2A-Related Speech Disorders and Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics GRIN2A-related speech disorders and epilepsy are characterized by speech disorders in all affected individuals and a range of epilepsy syndromes present in about 90%. Severe speech disorders observed can include dysarthria and speech dyspraxia, and both receptive and expressive language delay/regression; more mildly affected individuals may display subtly impaired intelligibility of conversational speech. Epilepsy features include seizure onset usually between ages three and six years, focal epilepsy with language and/or global developmental regression, and electroencephalogram (EEG) showing continuous spike-and-wave discharges in sleep or very active centrotemporal discharges. Seizure types include seizures associated with aura of perioral paresthesia, focal or focal motor seizures (often evolving to generalized tonic-clonic), and atypical absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include: Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (ECSWS), childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS), atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (ACECTS), autosomal dominant rolandic epilepsy with speech dyspraxia (ADRESD), and infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a GRIN2A-related speech disorder and epilepsy is established in a proband by the identification of a GRIN2A heterozygous pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant speech/language deficits require therapy from a speech pathologist. Seizures should be treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Many different AEDs may be effective, and no one medication has been demonstrated to be effective specifically for these disorders. Prevention of secondary complications: Monitoring for possible adverse effects of AEDs. Surveillance: Developmental surveillance in all affected children; routine monitoring of speech and language by a speech pathologist should be considered for all children, particularly those diagnosed before reaching school age. Agents/circumstances to avoid: In individuals with ECSWS, phenytoin, barbiturates and carbamazepine should be avoided as they are rarely effective, may worsen the EEG, and have negative effects on neuropsychological outcomes. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt evaluation for speech disorders and/or seizures and institution of treatment. Genetic counseling GRIN2A-related speech disorders and epilepsy are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of GRIN2A-related speech disorders and epilepsy caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with a GRIN2A-related speech disorder and epilepsy has a 50% chance of inheriting the GRIN2A pathogenic variant. Once the GRIN2A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Individuals who complain of insomnia report repeated difficulty with either initially falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia) or remaining asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep. Their sleep is described as short and inadequate, light and easily disrupted, of poor quality, unrefreshing, unsatisfactory, or nonrestorative. Frequent extended periods of wakefulness or persistent early morning awakenings may be reported. In children, insomnia may present as bedtime resistance or lack of ability to sleep independently. This sleep disturbance is associated with impairment of daytime function. Most investigators define insomnia as a sleep latency of 30 minutes or more; wake time after sleep onset of 30 minutes or more; sleep efficiency of less than 85%; or total sleep time less than 6 to 6.5 hours, occurring at least 3 nights a week. Patients with insomnia often report greater subjective sleep disturbance compared to objective polysomnographic parameters. The discrepancy between subjective estimates and objective measures of sleep is believed to be due to persistent sensory processing during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which decreases the ability of patients with insomnia to distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Perception of sleep appears to be altered. Persons with insomnia may have a greater tendency to describe, when awakened from sleep, of being awake all along, compared with those without insomnia. In addition, they may overestimate the duration of their sleep latencies.",

Onset ranges from birth to adulthood. Individuals can present in childhood with motor delays and gait instability. Cognitive impairment ranging from mild intellectual disability to developmental delay has been reported, and several individuals have normal cognitive function. Individuals have also presented as young adults with gait difficulties caused by spastic ataxia or ataxia. In addition to gait ataxia, affected individuals had limb ataxia, dysarthria, and eye movement abnormalities (macro-saccadic oscillations, nystagmus, and saccadic pursuit). Additional features reported in some individuals include peripheral neuropathy and/or seizures. The disorder progresses to spastic ataxia or generalized dystonia, which can lead to loss of independent ambulation. Diagnosis The diagnosis of VPS13D movement disorder is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in VPS13D on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for seizures; spasticity treatments include baclofen, tizanidine, benzodiazepines, dantrolene sodium, gabapentin, botulinum toxin injections, and intrathecal baclofen; treatment options for dystonia include trihexyphenidyl, botulinum toxin injections, benzodiazepines, baclofen, and levodopa. A multidisciplinary team including occupational and physical therapists and a physiatrist is important; supportive developmental therapies should be provided as needed. Surveillance: Monitor for urinary urgency, contractures, and seizures; evaluate fall risk and gait stability; monitor developmental progress and educational needs. Genetic counseling VPS13D movement disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the VPS13D pathogenic variants in the family are known.",

It is an infrequent syndrome that predominantly affects to teenagers, and boys are four times more likely to be affected than girls. It is rare for patients over 30 years although some cases have been reported. Kleine-Levin syndrome is a recurrent hypersomnia characterized by episodes of hypersomnia lasting for 2 days to 4 weeks associated with symptoms of hyperphagia, hypersexuality and cognitive impairment. It can be accompanied by other abnormal behavior such as aggression, personality changes and irritability. Deficits are resolved between episodes. Case report It is presented the case report of a patient that suffers from recurrent episodes of hypersomnia associated with hyperphagia and abnormal behavior. Electroencephalography EEG demonstrates slowing of drowsiness and a decrease in REM sleep. The test of multiple sleep latency is abnormal and the rest of complementary test are normal. Diagnosis F51.1 Recurrent hypersomnia (Kleine-Levin syndrome) [307.44]. Discussion Kleine-Levin syndrome is an intriguing, severe and homogenous disease with no obvious cause or treatment. Treatment is generally supportive. It should be considered in any teenager presenting with recurrent episodes of hypersomnia concurrent with cognitive changes or disinhibition.

Delirium was missed to start with and instead of finding out the cause, knee-jerk responses with drugs were used to treat 'disruptive behaviour' on the ward. Delirium is often slow to resolve and can take several weeks to months. In fact, unresolved delirium predicts discharge to skilled nursing facilities. However, it is worth excluding reversible conditions like intercurrent infections, drugs or underlying dementia. The presence of previous mild cognitive impairment can support a diagnosis of dementia but remember that this is a very heterogenous group with differing outcomes. Furthermore, underlying cognitive impairment can predispose individuals to delirium. Behavioural therapy and rivastigmine improved the hallucinations and confusion but the cognitive impairment persisted. The fluctuating confusion, cognitive impairment, dysautonomia, visual hallucinations, acting out dreams, Parkinsonian features and antipsychotic sensitivity all fitted with Lewy body dementia.",

      "abstract": "Key-words Disease name and synonyms Definition Abstract The syndrome of continuous spike and waves discharges during slow sleep (CSWSS) is a rare form of age-related epilepsy. Onset occurs between ages 3 and 7 years, and rarely before 2 years. In the absence of brain lesions, CSWSS syndrome occurs in normally developing children. Partial or generalized seizures are rare and occur while the child is falling asleep. Cognitive functions are subsequently altered and behavioural disorders are often seen. The initial neuropsychological deficits affecting a specific cognitive function such as language, gesture or constructive abilities, attention span or behaviour control are often wrongly attributed to psychological problems. The best known cognitive deficit is aphasia. Acquired epileptic aphasia, the Landau and Kleffner syndrome, has been named after the authors who described it in 1957. EEG anomalies are always present. During wakefulness, EEG recordings show focal paroxysmal spike and wave discharges. During slow sleep, spikes and waves become generalized and continuous, occupying over 85% of sleep. There are no concomitant motor seizures, but cognitive impairments progress. With antiepileptic drugs, the EEG becomes normal and neuropsychological status improves with antiepileptic drugs. Epileptic seizures always disappear with adolescence but neuropsychological sequelae may persist. There is no specific treatment with durable effects on the seizures and neuropsychological disorders. Management of CSWSS syndrome requires teams specialized in pediatric epilepsy and neuropsychology.",

Researchers have identified distinct behavioral phenotypes among developmental disabilities expressed as language development, cognitive profiles, adaptive behavior, and self‐injury/aggression. In this article, we discuss evidence for the presence of polysomnographic phenotypes in developmental disabilities. Researchers using behavioral and/or electrophysiological measures have identified differences in sleep architecture among people with autism, Down syndrome, and fragile X syndrome. In general, the greater the level of mental retardation, the less time spent in rapid eye movement sleep. The presence of autism or Down syndrome is associated with fewer and briefer bouts of rapid eye movement sleep, and total sleep time. Autism is also associated with greater levels of undifferentiated sleep. These findings for autism and Down syndrome contrast with fragile X syndrome whose sleep architecture anomalies appear to be a function of mental retardation level.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is characterized by distinctive facial features (widely spaced eyes, broad eyebrows with a medial flare, low-hanging columella, prominent or pointed chin, open-mouth expression, and uplifted earlobes with a central depression), congenital heart defects with predilection for abnormalities of the pulmonary arteries and/or valves, Hirschsprung disease or chronic constipation, genitourinary anomalies (particularly hypospadias in males), and hypogenesis or agenesis of the corpus callosum. Most affected individuals have moderate-to-severe intellectual disability. Speech is typically limited to a few words or is absent, with relative preservation of receptive language skills. Growth restriction with microcephaly and seizure disorder are also common. Most affected people have a happy demeanor and a wide-based gait that can sometimes be confused with Angelman syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MWS is established in a proband with classic dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay / intellectual disability and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ZEB2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Care by the appropriate specialist for dental anomalies, seizures, ocular abnormalities, congenital heart defects, chronic constipation, Hirschsprung disease, genitourinary abnormalities, and pectus anomalies of the chest and/or foot/ankle anomalies; educational intervention and speech therapy beginning in infancy. Surveillance: Annual eye examination in childhood to monitor for strabismus and refractive errors; monitoring for otitis media; regular developmental assessments to plan/refine educational interventions; periodic reevaluation by a clinical geneticist. Genetic counseling MWS is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a pathogenic variant in ZEB2, a heterozygous deletion of 2q22.3 involving ZEB2, or (rarely) a chromosome rearrangement that disrupts ZEB2. Almost all individuals reported to date have been simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) resulting from a de novo genetic alteration; rarely, recurrence in a family has been reported when a parent has a low level of somatic or presumed germline mosaicism for a MWS-causing pathogenic variant. Individuals with MWS are not known to reproduce. Once the causative genetic alteration has been identified in the proband, prenatal testing may be offered to parents of a child with MWS because of the recurrence risk associated with the possibility of parental mosaicism or a balanced chromosome rearrangement.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy, a common neurologic problem encountered by family physicians, can be classified clinically by the anatomic pattern of presenting symptoms and, if indicated, by results of electrodiagnostic studies for axonal and demyelinating disease. The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in the general population ranges from 1% to 7%, with higher rates among those older than 50 years. Common identifiable causes include diabetes mellitus, nerve compression or injury, alcohol use, toxin exposure, hereditary diseases, and nutritional deficiencies. Peripheral neuropathy is idiopathic in 25% to 46% of cases. Diagnosis requires a comprehensive history, physical examination, and judicious laboratory testing. Early peripheral neuropathy may present as sensory alterations that are often progressive, including sensory loss, numbness, pain, or burning sensations in a stocking and glove distribution of the extremities. Later stages may involve proximal numbness, distal weakness, or atrophy. Physical examination should include a comprehensive neurologic and musculoskeletal evaluation. If the peripheral nervous system is identified as the likely source of the patient's symptoms, evaluation for potential underlying etiologies should initially focus on treatable causes. Initial laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count; a comprehensive metabolic profile; fasting blood glucose, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels; and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation. If the initial evaluation is inconclusive, referral to a neurologist for additional testing (e.g., electrodiagnostic studies, specific antibody assays, nerve biopsy) should be considered. Treatment of peripheral neuropathy focuses on managing the underlying etiology. Several classes of medications, including gabapentinoids and antidepressants, can help alleviate neuropathic pain.",

Cross-condition comparison of the nature and frequency of cognitive impairment is difficult as these conditions often coexist, and there exists no consensus as to the definition of cognitive impairment, nor the optimal number and type of neuropsychological tests required for evaluation. There is as yet no clear evidence for condition-specific profiles of cognitive impairment. Rather, a generalized profile consisting of subclinical levels of impairment in attention, processing speed, executive, and memory functions from bilateral frontal-subcortical ischemia fits across all conditions. This profile: occurs only in subgroups of patients; is inconsistently related to measures of illness severity; is unrelated to patient self-report or level of functional independence; is exacerbated by very high levels of emotional distress; and is reversible in some cases but can also progress to frank neurological disease (dementia) in others, especially the elderly, when multiple conditions coexist, and/or when medical condition severity progresses.",

      "title": "Dopamine, Alpha-Synuclein, and Mitochondrial Dysfunctions in Parkinsonian Eyes",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor dysfunctions including bradykinesia, tremor at rest and motor instability. These symptoms are associated with the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons originating in the substantia nigra pars compacta and projecting to the corpus striatum, and by accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions mainly consisting of aggregated alpha-synuclein, called Lewy bodies. PD is a complex, multifactorial disorder and its pathogenesis involves multiple pathways and mechanisms such as α-synuclein proteostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, axonal transport and neuroinflammation. Motor symptoms manifest when there is already an extensive dopamine denervation. There is therefore an urgent need for early biomarkers to apply disease-modifying therapeutic strategies. Visual defects and retinal abnormalities, including decreased visual acuity, abnormal spatial contrast sensitivity, color vision defects, or deficits in more complex visual tasks are present in the majority of PD patients. They are being considered for early diagnosis together with retinal imaging techniques are being considered as non-invasive biomarkers for PD. Dopaminergic cells can be found in the retina in a subpopulation of amacrine cells; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to visual deficits observed in PD patients are still largely unknown. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the retinal abnormalities observed in PD patients and animal models and of the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in parkinsonian eyes. We will review the role of α-synuclein aggregates in the retina pathology and/or in the onset of visual symptoms in PD suggesting that α-synuclein aggregates are harmful for the retina as well as for the brain. Moreover, we will summarize experimental evidence suggesting that the optic nerve pathology observed in PD resembles that seen in mitochondrial optic neuropathies highlighting the possible involvement of mitochondrial abnormalities in the development of PD visual defects. We finally propose that the eye may be considered as a complementary experimental model to identify possible novel disease' pathways or to test novel therapeutic approaches for PD.",

Unawareness of the meaning of these symptoms often mislead both the patient and his physician.To define and describe the types of visual illusions and hallucinations which can be commonly encountered in neuro-ophthalmological practice.Overview article.Hallucinations are a perception not based on sensory input, whereas illusions are a misinterpretation of a correct sensory input. Both phenomenon can be due to medication or drug, or to an altered mental status. Visual hallucinations can be formed (objects, people) or unformed (light, geometric figures). They can be generated either by a lesion on the antechiasmatic pathway, by a seizure phenomenon, by a migrainous phenomenon, or by a release phenomenon secondary to visual differentiation. Investigations will be directed towards a retinopathy, an optic neuropathy, a chiasmal or retrochiasmal lesion, or a bilateral antechiasmal lesion (Charles Bonnet syndrome). Visual illusions include meta-morphopsias, micro- macropsias, polyopia, palinopsia (visual perseveration), achromatopsia, Pulfrich phenomenon, or subjective vertical deviation. Illusions can be due to lesions of the retina, the optic nerve, the visual cortex (primary or associative), or the graviceptive pathways.As most patients do not spontaneously mention their symptoms, history taking is essential. The first step is to rule out medication or an altered mental status as the possible cause of these symptoms. Then, careful visual function examination should provide a good insight in the location of the lesion.",

      "title": "Delayed Neuronal Degeneration Results from Endogenous Glutamate Excess",
      "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes clinical neurological dysfunction that may be acute, fluctuating, or progressive.1,2 The molecular basis for neuronal injury has not been elucidated, although antineuronal antibodies have been identified in some patients. Immune-mediated injury to vessels or to coagulation cascades that cause inflammatory vasculopathies or embolic or hemorrhagic phenomena can produce ischemia and neuron death, as in stroke, seizures, and spinal cord and peripheral nervous system disease.3 Questions about the mechanism of chronic neurological disease in SLE, such as encephalopathy, and cognitive and behavioral disorders, arise when the autoantibody markers for active SLE fail to correlate with the neurological symptoms.1,4,5 (For an alternate opinion, see ref. 6.) Some will argue that this failure amounts to inadequate methodology either in detection of autoantibodies or in detection of a cytokine imbalance that mediates central nervous system injury independent of autoantibodies. Alternatively, chronic or progressive neurological symptoms in SLE may not depend on the activity of the systemic disease. For example, neurologic disease in SLE could depend on nonimmune-mediated factors like infection and toxic effects of medications. There is another possible mechanism that would account for the failure of chronic or progressive neurological disease to correlate with systemic disease. Recent experiments in several different animal models suggest that an initial insult to the brain may initiate a cascade of events that ultimately lead to distal progressive neuron loss. Based on these studies it is possible that an immune insult could initiate injury and become resolved, but the neuron injury could continue in an expanding cascade without the presence of serum markers of immunologic disease. Building on experimental evidence that had demonstrated that the increased excitatory effect of glutamate and calcium influx causes neuronal death, studies on different animal models suggest that after an initial injury, neurons distant from the region of the first injury may die as the excitatory and inhibitory tone changes on downstream glutamate neurons.7–15 One experimental model demonstrated that ischemic or neurotoxic damage to the striatum caused, days later, the degeneration of 50% of the GABA neurons in the substantia nigra,13–15 although the substantia nigra was not damaged by the initial striatal injury. Behavioral changes in the animals correlated with the development of delayed neuronal degeneration.16 One possible mechanism for the delayed degeneration of GABA neurons in the substantia nigra reticulata depended on glutamatergic overactivity. A brief review of the critical feature of the anatomy of the striatonigral system shows that the substantia nigra reticulata receives inhibitory afferents from the striatum (caudate-putamen and globus pallidus), and excitatory glutamatergic afferents from the subthalamic nucleus. In the next experiment, ablation of the subthalamic nucleus occurred prior to the striatal injury. The nigral GABA neurons were completely protected from the endogenous excitotoxicity.14 These results suggest a central role for alterations of glutamate activity in chronic progressive neurological disease and raise the question of whether SLE cytokines or antibodies may provoke similar delayed neuronal injury by altering glutamatergic activity. In this hypothesis SLE cytokines or antibodies might affect upstream neurons and initiate a cascade of events that would evolve over a longer time, and lead eventually to neuronal death through overexcitation; alternatively SLE cytokines or antibodies might acutely affect glutamate receptors. This hypothesis would be plausible if SLE determined brain injury-affected neurons with excitatory or inhibitory activity on glutamatergic neurons or if SLE cytokines or antibodies demonstrated an effect on glutamate receptors. In fact, it has been demonstrated in SLE that microinfarcts and larger vessel occlusions destroy cortical, striatal, or thalamic brain regions with afferents to downstream glutamatergic neurons. Also, in SLE, defective regulation and function of interleukin-4, -6, and -10 have been recorded,17,18 and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that interleukin-6 protects neurons against glutamate-induced death.19 Interleukin-1-receptor antagonist also protects against excitotoxin-induced neuron death in in vivo experiments.20 Furthermore, some studies have identified a lymphocytotoxic antibody that cross-reacts with brain tissue.21 The recent finding, however, of autoantibodies to the glutamate receptor in patients with encephalitis and paraneoplastic syndrome22,23 may set the stage for a discovery of an autoantibody in SLE to the glutamate receptor. These data suggest that the search for the pathogenesis of the chronic neurological symptoms in SLE should also include the possibility that delayed neuronal degeneration may occur after the initial injury and need not necessarily associate with active SLE. Delayed neuronal degeneration might help explain the progressive or fluctuating neurologic impairments in systemic lupus erythematosus.",

This article summarizes a century of sleep research to examine the maladies of dreaming, their pathophysiologic significance, and management.Under healthy physiologic conditions, REM sleep is characterized by vivid mentation combined with skeletal muscle paralysis. The loss of REM sleep atonia in RBD results in vivid, potentially injurious dream enactment to patients and bed partners. RBD is common, affecting at least 1% of the population and is primarily caused by α-synuclein pathology of REM sleep-related brainstem neurons. The majority of patients with RBD ultimately develop a neurodegenerative syndrome such as Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. Among patients with Parkinson disease, RBD predicts an aggressive disease course with rapid cognitive, motor, and autonomic decline. RBD is diagnosed by the presence of dream enactment episodes (either recorded or clinically recalled) and physiologic evidence of REM sleep without atonia demonstrated on polysomnography. Bedroom safety is of paramount importance in the management of RBD while pharmacokinetic options include melatonin or clonazepam.The injurious dream enactment of RBD is common and treatable. It is a syndrome of α-synuclein pathology with most patients ultimately developing Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or a related disorder.",

Similarly, the EEG abnormalities seen in autistic epileptiform regression (language and social/behavioral deterioration) are nonspecific and overlap with those seen in LKS. By contrast, distinct epilepsy syndromes in otherwise normal children occur in the EEG‐deflned benign focal epilepsies of childhood. Occipital spikes or spike‐wave present either in the older child with visual symptoms and headache or in the younger child with autonomic symptoms followed by brief or prolonged partial motor seizures. Seven young children (five from a consecutive series of 42) presenting clinically with autism or autistic regression and possible or definite seizures, whose EEGs revealed occipital spikes or spike‐wave characteristic of the benign epilepsies, are reported. Although occipital spikes are commonly seen in young children as an age‐dependent EEG‐defined benign focal epilepsy, their high frequency in this population with cognitive difficulties suggests a possible causal relation. The effects of the epileptiform discharge on cognitive functioning presumably reflect extension into temporal and parietal lobes, rather than occipital disturbances per se.",

We present the case of a 75-year-old man with eye enucleation referred for electrodiagnostic evaluation of the right upper limb after an accidental fall. Neurological examination showed proximal muscle weakness, but MG was not initially considered because the patient lacked the classic ocular symptoms of MG. The delay in diagnosis resulted in worsening of systemic MG symptoms, although in other patients it may have precipitated MG crisis or possibly death.

Neurogenic dysphagia is observed in approximately 50% of common neurological disorders such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Although the pathophysiology and course of the disease vary, dysphagia may occur at any stage of swallowing, including oral preparation, oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases. Neurogenic dysphagia ranks among the top symptoms that restrict patients' independence in daily life activities, reduce their quality of life, and increase morbidity and mortality rates. Despite being a prevalent and highly impactful symptom among patients, neurogenic dysphagia can go unnoticed among the multiple symptoms experienced by neurological disorders due to their nature. It is important to be aware of disease-specific risk factors for the early detection of neurogenic dysphagia. Overlooked dysphagia can lead to complications such as aspiration pneumonia, dehydration, malnutrition, and weight loss. Among these complications, aspiration pneumonia is the most common, requiring attention due to its recurrent hospitalizations, inpatient treatment, and high healthcare costs. Many patients exhibit common neurogenic dysphagia symptoms such as drinking liquids in small sips, cutting solid foods into small pieces, decreased appetite, and prolonged meal times. The aim of this study is to examine various aspects of neurogenic dysphagia in different neurological disorders, including its etiology, risk factors, symptoms, and prevalence.",

All of the patients had a memory disorder characterized by anterograde and retrograde loss. One patient had significant language impairment. These deficits persisted in all but one patient who had a predominantly mesencephalic lesion.

This case report examines the unusual eye movements-during these nonseizure times-of a patient diagnosed with complex partial seizure disorder.An 8-year-old boy was referred to the clinic by his pediatric neurologist for a comprehensive examination to rule out a visual cause for the abnormal eye movements observed by the patient's mother. Ocular examination revealed periodic, spontaneous, versional eye movements to the left and right, accompanied by a small widening of the fissures and turning of the head. No vergence or accommodative problems were detected, but Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) and Visagraph testing showed mild dysfunction. Ocular health was unremarkable, while radiology studies and neurological evaluation yielded no observable pathology.Complex partial seizure disorder can affect the visual system in a wide variety of ways. The precise role, if any, that complex partial seizure disorder plays in ocular motility control during nonseizure moments is unknown.

      "title": "Electrical Status Epilepticus in Sleep: Clinical Presentation and Pathophysiology",
      "abstract": "Electrical status epilepticus in sleep involves an electroencephalographic pattern where interictal epileptiform activity is potentiated in the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Near-continuous spikes and waves that occupy a significant proportion of nonrapid eye movement sleep appear as a result of sleep-potentiated epileptiform activity. This electroencephalographic pattern appears in different electroclinical syndromes that present three common characteristics with different degrees of severity: seizures, sleep-potentiated epileptiform activity, and neuropsychologic regression. Continuous spikes and waves during sleep comprise the severest epileptic encephalopathy in the electroclinical spectrum. Landau-Kleffner syndrome presents with intermediate severity. Some \"benign\" pediatric focal epileptic syndromes represent the mildest end of this continuum. Based on published data, we provide a framework for clinical and electrical events. The underlying mechanisms leading to sleep potentiation of epileptiform activity in electrical status epilepticus in sleep are incompletely understood. A genetic basis or acquired early developmental insult may disrupt the normal maturation of neuronal networks. These factors may dynamically alter normal processes of brain development, leading to an age-related pattern of electroclinical expression of electrical status epilepticus in sleep.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive deficit is the one of the key groups of symptoms in schizophrenia. These disorders reflect pathological processes in the central nervous system and are an important predictor of the social functioning recovery of patients. The question of the deficit structure remains open. In some cases, cognitive impairments are detected in early school age, in others, they appear only in adolescence. At the disease onset, there is a sharp deterioration in cognitive functioning. Further change is also heterogeneous: the same cognitive functions can either remain stable, or deteriorate or improve. To further study the cognitive deficit, it is necessary to distinguish more homogeneous groups based on both clinical parameters, and on the results of performing cognitive tests. It is important for the future of the concept of cognitive deficit to correlate it with the usual conceptualizations, including pathopsychological symptom groups.",

When one turns to the dementia of PD (PDD) or that of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)—2 syndromes that are presently only distinguished by an arbitrary cutoff in the timing of motor compared to cognitive dimensions, but are quite possibly manifestations of the same pathologic process—the heart, for many, has often led the mind in assuming that cognitive decline must also relate to dysfunction of (nonmotor) frontal-subcortical loops or dopaminergic degeneration of meso-limbic or meso-cortical projections. Aside from possible prejudice in this assumption, there may be notable methodologic problems in being too focused on a system-specific hypothesis for cognitive decline in a neurodegenerative disease. Focusing exclusively on imaging the dopaminergic system in PDD/DLB, for instance, and finding correlations with behavior could indicate a causal relationship, but if imaging and behavioral change are each a function of disease duration or severity of …",

Less common causes of the PDD clinical syndrome include progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Most cases of PDD have diffuse cortical Lewy bodies, medial temporal neurofibrillary degeneration, and neocortical diffuse amyloid deposits. In most cases, Alzheimer-type pathology is not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A subset of cases have concurrent AD, multiple cerebrovascular lesions consistent with vascular dementia, or severe pathology of the isodendritic core of cortically projecting subcortical nuclei with Lewy-related pathology that is relatively restricted to brainstem or limbic areas. Comparable degrees of Lewy-related and Alzheimer-type pathology are sometimes detected in subjects with PD without dementia, which suggests that there are other, yet to be determined, factors that are more proximal causes of cognitive impairment in PDD, such as synaptic loss, deficiencies of neurotransmitters, or the presence of soluble toxic oligomers of Aβ, tau or α-synuclein that lead to neuronal dysfunction.",

Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "abstract": "In behavioral medicine, sleep disorders, insomnia in particular, may be considered comorbidities and precipitating factors to intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD). Nevertheless, sleep alterations have often been neglected in favor of daytime features and symptoms, albeit simple behavioral nighttime observations may disclose hypermotor features that characterize restless sleep. The root of most hypermotor restlessness is linked to central iron deficiency. The latter is often exacerbated by vitamin D deficiency (VDD), which interferes with both dopaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms. In this way, an imbalance affecting daytime behavior and mood is created. Several sleep-related motor disorders such as bruxism, periodic and aperiodic leg movements, Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), and Restless Sleep Disorder (RSD) are commonly seen in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). However, they are rarely diagnosed and often overlooked in affected children and adolescents. As a result, not only are these disorders not adequately addressed therapeutically, but their symptoms may be worsened by the side-effects of drugs used to contain disruptive daytime behavior, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants. In children with IDDs, obesity, inactivity and metabolic effects of antipsychotics often lead to Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), which is currently understood as an inflammatory state leading to “hyperactive” lethargy and further alterations of the hypoxic chain and vitamin D levels. Endorsing simple routine blood tests, including inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, ferritin, transferrin, and vitamin D levels, may favorably complement caregiver observations and ambulatory sleep recordings, leading to a sleep disorder diagnosis and consequent therapy. In fact, the treatment of SDB, RLS, and RSD has been copiously demonstrated to favorably impact vigilance, behavior, social competence, and academic skills in healthy and, to a greater extent, in IDD children. Thus, consulting and deliberating the root causes of functional and categorical diagnoses within a clinical framework may engender a more precise diagnosis and further benefit pediatric daytime and nighttime management of hyperactive behaviors.",

The four children described here presented with a developmental behavioral triad: 1) atypically speedy motor development, 2) impaired expressive speech, and 3) tongue carriage dysfunction resulting in related misarticulations. Those characteristics might be phenotypically or genetically clustered. These children didn’t have impaired cognition, neurological or mental disease, defective sense organs, craniofacial dysmorphology or susceptibility to upper respiratory infections, particularly recurrent otitis media. Attention should be paid on discordant and unbalanced achievement of developmental milestones. Present children are termed SPEEDY babies, where SPEEDY refers to rapid independent walking, SPEE and DY to dyspractic or dysfunctional speech development and lingual dysfunction resulting in linguoalveolar misarticulations. SPEEDY babies require health care that recognizes and respects their motor skills and supports their needs for motor activities and on the other hand include treatment for impaired speech. The parents may need advice and support with these children. Keywords: speedy walking, speech disorder, misarticulations",

      "title": "Mild Cognitive Impairment as the Initial Manifestation of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a major form atypical parkinsonism that should be differentiated from Parkinson's disease. Individuals with PSP typically present with an akinetic rigid syndrome with early postural instability, axial rigidity, and supranuclear gaze palsy.1, 2 Cognitive disorder in PSP is milder than Alzheimer's disease,3 featuring frontal executive dysfunction,4, 5 and appears with motor signs.1, 2 In contrast, it is rare that cognitive disorder occurs without motor disorder in PSP.2, 3 Such a patient was recently seen. A 73-year-old, previously healthy woman began to have memory problems (e.g., forgetful, forgetting to turn lights off, forgetting neighbors’ names) and infrequent delusional episodes (e.g., thinking that someone had stolen her wallet) for which she saw a general physician, who referred her to a memory clinic. She was taking no drugs that might affect cognitive or motor function. She was alert but slightly nervous and irritable. Her speech was fluent, and cranial nerve examinations, including extraocular muscle movement and eyelids, produced normal results. Her posture, including her neck, was normal. She had no tremor, rigidity, or akinesia of the neck, hands, or feet. Her gait was slightly slow for her age. Sensory examinations were unremarkable. She scored 20 out of 30 (normal > 24) on the Mini-Mental state Examination (MMSE) and 8 out of 18 (normal > 16) on the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Laboratory data were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1A) and brain 99mTc- L,L-ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography showed no remarkable changes. Metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy results were normal (heart to mediastinum ratio on delayed images 3.35, normal > 2.0).6 Although hippocampal atrophy was not remarkable, she was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due possibly to Alzheimer's disease. She was referred back to the local clinic, where 5 mg/d donepezil hydrochloride was started. Two years later, she was referred to the memory clinic again because of slow, short-stepped gait with assistance that had begun 1 year before. On examination, her cognitive function had deteriorated: MMSE score 14, FAB score 5. Delusions were not significant. Cranial nerve examination showed supranuclear vertical gaze palsy and dysarthria. She had no retropulsion. She had rigidity in her neck and upper extremities and marked akinesia bilaterally. She had no signs of aphasia, apraxia, limb dystonia, or alien hands. Brain MRI showed atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum (humming-bird sign or emperor penguin sign)7 (Figure 1B), and she was diagnosed with PSP1, 2 and referred back to the local clinic with instructions that she needed 300 mg/d of levodopa/carbidopa for gait difficulty. At the first visit, she had MCI alone without motor disorder. At the second visit, 2 years later, she had vertical gaze palsy and axial rigidity and akinesia. She did not have classical corticobasal syndrome during the course of the disease. Repeated brain MRI revealed midbrain atrophy and neurological signs. No similar cases had been previously reported to the knowledge of the authors except for a schizophrenia-like case8 and two cases of behavioral changes.9, 10 At the first memory screening, The woman described herein had marked frontal executive dysfunction as assessed according to the FAB. Prominent frontal dysfunction is a feature of PSP but not of Alzheimer's disease.3 A pathological lesion might have started in the frontal cortex and caused her frontal executive dysfunction. In conclusion, an elderly woman with PSP who presented with MCI without motor disorder is reported. MCI can be listed as a premotor feature of PSP.

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "abstract": "Purpose In persons with an intellectual developmental disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often difficult to differentiate, particularly when patients present major communication difficulties and low accessibility to subjective symptoms and clinicians are poorly trained in the specific psychopathological phenomenology. OCD and ASD share some important symptoms such as repetitiveness of behaviours, low flexibility to contextual variations or a narrow range of interests. The purpose of this study is to identify and describe symptomatological specificities, including how they manifest at behavioural level. Design/methodology/approach The present study is a retrospective case series study ( n = 3) focusing on in-depth assessment, detection and comprehension of symptomatological specificities as well as on the direct observation of behavioural symptoms. Findings Some symptoms such as signs of sudden autonomous nervous system activation or behavioural equivalents of obsessive thoughts are crucial in achieving an effective differential or comorbidity diagnosis. These symptoms can be identified through a multidisciplinary and comprehensive evaluation, integrating present clinical and test findings with a thorough developmental and medical history. Symptoms should also be interpreted in the light of antecedent, contextual and personal factors. Originality/value Differential diagnosis between OCD and ASD in persons with major cognitive and communication issues is a rather neglected research area, although it has significant implications for treatment planning and implementation.",

We assessed visual ADLs with the Visual Activities Questionnaire in 25 non-demented patients with PD, 13 with tremor as the initial symptom and 12 with an initial symptom other than tremor, as well as in 23 healthy control participants (NC). As expected, the non-tremor patients, but not the tremor patients, reported more impairment in visual ADLs than the NC group, including in light/dark adaptation, acuity/spatial vision, depth perception, peripheral vision and visual processing speed. Non-tremor patients were significantly worse than tremor patients overall and on light/dark adaptation and depth perception. Environmental enhancements especially targeted to patients with the non-tremor PD subtype may help to ameliorate their functional disability. (JINS, 2011, 17, 841–852)",

      "title": "Hereditary Optic Neuropathies",
      "abstract": "Abstract Hereditary optic neuropathies are a group of disorders characterized by optic nerve damage in which the underlying cause is heritable. Optic atrophy is a clinical state in which there is pallor of the optic nerve due to loss of ganglion cell axons and supporting microvascular tissue, often associated with decreased vision. Optic neuropathy is a more general term that includes the early phase of the disease when optic atrophy may not yet be present. Clinical severity may vary from lack of symptoms to complete blindness. Hereditary causes of optic neuropathy include primary optic nerve disease; compression by a genetically determined tumor, for example, in neurofibromatosis; or degeneration, as occurs in the later stages of retinitis pigmentosa. Although glaucoma is an optic neuropathy and has features like other hereditary optic neuropathies, it is not discussed in this chapter. Optic atrophy may be an isolated event or may be associated with other neurologic or systemic manifestations. In this chapter we discuss Kjer autosomal dominant optic atrophy and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) as well as optic atrophy associated with Wolfram syndrome and some of the neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction appears to be a common denominator in many of the hereditary optic neuropathies.",

The syndrome may occur in cases of apparent health or show itself as an exacerbation during any form of schizophrenia. The heredobiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms, and the clinical course prove that this syndrome does not represent a separate schizophrenic group but merely a complication. The symptoms are: A prodromal phase which lasts from 2 weeks to a few months and shows the usual schizophrenic pattern. First Phase.—Increasing perplexity and intense anxiety; incoherence; extreme restlessness; a \"blind drive for annihilation\" and suicidal tendencies; acrocyanosis, increased blood-pressure. Second Phase.—Motor restlessness changing to a more primitive pattern; consciousness becomes increasingly clouded; unusual hematopoietic changes of the blood; blood pressure falls; pulse is rapid and weak; pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light; reflexes are decreased; high elevation of temperature; pronounced cyanosis; petechial hemorrhages into the tissue; sudden respiratory death or vasomotor collapse. Autopsy Findings.—Negative except for petechial hemorrhages into the tissues, and transformation of the fatty bone marrow to the erythropoietic state. A theory of possible \"asthenic metabolic changes\" due to disturbances in the hormonal-vegetative system, and its practical application were discussed.",

Three different symptoms can be described from the cases reported in the literature: disorder of voluntary lid closing and/or opening, cortical ptosis, and inability to keep the eyes closed for more than a few seconds (,,motor impersistance\"). This last symptom can be considered as an unspecific sign of brain-damage. For the disturbance of voluntary lid opening/closure, the term ,,cortical palsy\" of lid movements is proposed. Thus this symptom can be differentiated from other supranuclear disorders of lid movements where reflectory and/or spontaneous lid movements are also impaired. As in all cases reported, the elementary motility of the eyelids (opening and closure) is impaired, it is not possible to ascertain whether a lid-apraxia is present.",

      "abstract": "Neuromuscular disease (NMD) is a diverse group of hereditary or acquired conditions involving the anterior horn cells, nerves, neuromuscular junction or muscles. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in children and adults with NMD with an estimated prevalence exceeding 40%. Characteristics of NMD like progressive neuromuscular weakness of respiratory and diaphragmatic muscles, anatomic or neurologic propensity to upper airway obstruction during sleep, and/or cardiomyopathy contribute to the development of SDB. Prevalence and pattern of SDB vary with different types of NMD, depending on the features of the disease and the tempo of progression to respiratory muscle impairment. Importantly, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and nocturnal hypoventilation are often the first signs of respiratory muscle weakness in patients with NMD. The imbalance between respiratory capacity and respiratory loads usually first manifests during sleep, if not acutely during respiratory decompensation in respiratory infection. In patients with NMD, SDB typically first develops in rapid-eye-movement sleep when muscle atonia occurs, followed by continuous nocturnal hypoventilation through the night and eventually by progression into daytime respiratory failure. Untreated SDB and hypoventilation in NMD carries high respiratory morbidity and mortality. Therefore, screening for SDB and nocturnal hypoventilation is a vital part of long-term management of NMD and to detect patients at risk for respiratory failure. Anticipatory approach with regular assessment of symptoms, pulmonary function and sleep in children affected by NMD can aid early diagnosis and management of SDB. Timely provision of respiratory care and non-invasive ventilation are essential components of a multi-disciplinary care to improve quality of life and survival of patients with NMD.",

Usually the underlying disease process is benign and self-limited in nature. In the absence of hearing loss or additional neurologic findings, a common initial diagnosis is vestibular neuritis. The patient is treated symptomatically and observed for spontaneous resolution. However, other more serious disease processes may mimic the presentation of vestibular neuritis and be misdiagnosed. Five cases of serious central nervous system disorders that were similar to vestibular neuritis in their initial presentation are reviewed to illustrate this point. Each patient presented with the acute onset of continuous vertigo without associated hearing loss. The correct diagnosis was established only after further evaluation was pursued. Recommendations for the initial and subsequent evaluation of these patients are discussed.",

      "title": "Delirium and Dementia",
      "abstract": "Emergency physicians are frequently presented with patients exhibiting neurobehavioral abnormalities. These can be a harbin­ ger of a serious medical condition, and critical decisions must be made expeditiously about diagnostic evaluation, therapeutic intervention, and disposition. The first critical action is to recog­ nize the presence of the neurobehavioral abnormality. The second is to distinguish delirium from dementia or some other neuropsy­ chiatric condition. In the past, terms such as acute confusional state, sundowning, and organic brain syndrome have been used to describe a host of abnormal cognitive states that can be observed in the emer­ gency setting. These terms have loosely defined a group of neurobehavioral disorders that are caused by a physiologic dis­ turbance. Organic brain syndrome is a nebulous term that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition, text revision) eschews because the “organic” connotation implies that so­called functional mental disorders are without a biologic basis. Several key features best distinguish delirium from dementia: the time course of disease evolution, the presence of autonomic system involvement, the level of consciousness, and the presence of an underlying disease processes. Delirium is characterized by a fluctuating level of neurobehavioral disturbance typically pro­ gressing during minutes to hours to days. Delirium is a direct consequence of an acute systemic or central nervous system (CNS) stressor. Dementia, on the other hand, tends to follow a more gradual course, with evolution during months to years. Although patients with dementia exhibit confusion, disturbance in level of consciousness usually is not a feature, and manifestations of auto­ nomic nervous system abnormalities are minimal or absent. The evaluation of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with a disturbance of neurobehavioral state is best conducted in accordance with the following basic guidelines: 1. The first step is to determine whether this state represents delirium or dementia. The clinical findings may be subtle, and establishment of the diagnosis can be challenging, especially because delirium may be superimposed on dementia and dementia remains an independent risk factor for delirium. Early symptoms and signs may go unrecognized unless an adequate history is obtained from the patient, family members, and caregivers. A careful examination must include memory and cognitive assessment with a mental status screening examination. 2. Supportive care must be provided. This care may range in extent from aggressive airway and cardiovascular support to pharmacologic or physical restraint to simply placing the patient in a quiet room with appropriate environmental support. 3. A diligent search must be initiated for the underlying precipitating stressors in patients presenting with delirium.",

      "abstract": "Unilateral neglect can be defined as an impairment to detect, refer, orient or respond to stimuli presented contralaterally to a cerebral lesion, without any impairments in sensory-motor elementary functions. Development. The first descriptions were those of Hughlings Jackson (1876) and Anton (1893). The most important feature of the syndrome is a lateralization bias, which is directional in nature independently of the visual fields. It can be classified in: 1. Attentional (sensory neglect). 2. Intentional (motor neglect). The lesions that may be responsible for the neglect syndromes are usually found in the inferior parietal cortex of the right cerebral hemisphere (superior parietal when optic ataxia is prominent), and the right frontal lobe. Extinction is more frequently related to subcortical lesions (right lenticular nucleus, anterior aspects of peri-ventricular white matter). Unilateral neglect comprises a set of features that may coexist or be isolated traits: 1. Attentional neglect: hemi-inattention, allesthesia, allochiria, anosognosia (with/without somato-paraphrenia or misoplegia), and anoso-diaphoria, sensory extinction. 2. Intentional neglect: hemi-akinesia, directional hypokinesia, motor impersistence, motor extinction. Different theories try to explain the patho-physiology of these phenomena: the attentional-intentional model, the neural network model, the vectorial model, the representational model, and the premotor model, among others.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nCognitive functioning in individuals changes with aging. The\r\nextent and pattern of decline varies among various cognitive do mainsand also among individuals. Certain cognitive domains tend to decline as a person ages in comparison to his younger counterpart. Some elderly individuals may not show a decline in cognitive functioning. High intelligence, well organized work habits and sound judgment\r\ncompensate for many of the progressive shortcomings of old age.\r\nCognitive decline is thought to start after the age of 30 years. Little that is new and original is learned after the age of forty. A ttention, language, and memory are the basic processes that serve as building blocks for the development of higher intellectual functions. The higher cognitive functions include manipulation of well learned material, abstract thinking, problem solving, judgment,\r\narithmetic computations. These complex functions are predicated on the integrity and interaction of more basic processes. Because they represent the most advanced stages of intellectual development, the higher cognitive functions are more susceptible to neurological diseases. The\r\nevaluation of these higher functions may demonstrate the early effects of cortical damage before the more basic processes of attention, language and memory are affected.\r\nAIM OF STUDY\r\n1.To study the pattern of decline of various cognitive\r\nfunctioning with aging.\r\n2. To compare with healthy controls in the community.\r\n3. To identify the differences in cognitive status based on the educational level and IQ of the patient.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nSTUDY CENTRE:\r\nDepartment of Geriatric Medicine, Madras Medical College &\r\nRajiv Gandhi General Hospital Chennai.\r\nSTUDY DESIGN:\r\nCase control study.\r\nSAMPLE SIZE:\r\nOne hundred and twenty six: seventy six cases above the age of 65 and 50 controls from 20-30 age group.\r\nSTUDY DURATION:\r\nDecember 2011 –November 2012.\r\nSELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS:\r\nINCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n1.

The multifactorial nature of West syndrome and the variability in visual functions and visual functioning hinder the timely diagnosis of this type of visual impairment. The atypical way of following stimuli, establishing and maintaining visual contact, and sustaining visual attention are the first indicators of deviations in visual behavior that may suggest neuro-risk. Changes in visual behavior may manifest as alterations in the quality or absence of visual responsiveness, deficits in various visual functions, and oculomotor skills, often associated with atypical findings in visual evoked potentials. Cortically mediated visual functions, such as visual acuity, visual field, contrast sensitivity, and oculomotor skills, are also at risk in children with infantile spasms and West syndrome. In addition to basic visual functions, visuo-perceptual and visuo-motor skills are significantly affected, which is manifested in everyday behavior and motivation to observe. The degree and manifestations of CVI in children with infantile spasms depend on numerous factors. Multidisciplinary diagnostic procedures that determine whether cerebral visual impairment results from genetic factors, West syndrome, or other neurological conditions are crucial for creating treatment plans and predicting outcomes.",

However, the effects of DBS on nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are less clear.To review the published literature on nonmotor aspects of DBS for PD.The outcome of NMS after DBS in PD varies across studies. Some symptoms improve -sleep disorders, pain or sensory complaints, obsessive-compulsive disorder- and other aspects decline or appear -word fluency, apathy, body weight gain-. Isolated studies note mild improvements in working memory, visuomotor sequencing and conceptual reasoning, some gastrointestinal, urogenital, sweating and olfactory disturbances; whereas other studies have reported declines in verbal memory (long delay recall), visuospatial memory, processing speed and executive function; orthostatic hypotension remains without changes. The reasons for such a range of symptoms observed is due to the multifactorial etiology of the NMS, including preoperative vulnerability, changes in dopaminergic medications, surgical and stimulation effects, underlying PD-related factors and psychosocial effects. Specific patient subgroups may be at greater risk of cognitive deficits -e.g., those older than 69 years or with cognitive impairment prior to surgery- or depression, mania and suicide -e.g., those ones with preoperative psychiatric symptoms-.Patients who undergo DBS must be well-selected, weighing the risks and benefits, in order to obtain the best results with this treatment. Further multicentre studies are necessary to understand the role of DBS on NMS.",

It occurs as a consequence of brain damage localized in various cortical and/or subcortical structures, but mainly in parietotemporal areas of the right hemisphere. Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation. There are many different standardised and clinical assessment procedures of hemineglect. Clinical and functional tasks should be analysed along with behavioural observation in natural situations as well as interview data.

      "title": "Sleep problems in children with dyslexia: understanding the role of sleep in neurocognitive development through the lens of developmental disorders",
      "abstract": "It has long been recognised that sleep is more than a passive recovery state or mere inconvenience. Sleep plays an active role in maintaining a healthy body, brain and mind, and numerous studies suggest that sleep is integral to learning and memory. The importance of sleep for cognition is clear in studies of those experiencing sleep deprivation, who show consistent deficits across cognitive domains in relation to nonsleep-deprived controls, particularly in tasks that tax attention or executive functions 1. Poor sleep has been associated with poor grades, and academic performance suffers when sleep is sacrificed for extra study 2. Thus, it is perhaps unsurprising that children with developmental disorders of learning and cognition often suffer from sleep disturbances. These have been well documented in children with autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), where sleep problems can be particularly severe. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that sleep can be atypical across a spectrum of learning disorders. Understanding the ways in which sleep is affected in different developmental disorders can not only support the design and implementation of effective assessment and remediation programs, but can also inform theories of how sleep supports cognition in typical development. The study by Carotenuto et al. 3 in this issue makes a valuable contribution to this literature by looking at sleep disturbances in children with developmental dyslexia. Dyslexia is the most common specific learning disorder, affecting around one in 10 children in our classrooms. It is characterised by difficulties with reading and spelling and is primarily caused by a deficit in phonological processing. However, dyslexia often co-occurs with other developmental disorders, such as ADHD and specific language impairment, and there can be striking heterogeneity between children. This has led to the suggestion that dyslexia can result from complex combinations of multiple risk factors and impairments 4. Consequently, research attention is turning towards the wider constellation of subclinical difficulties often experienced by children with dyslexia, including potential sleep problems. Two preliminary studies have found differences in the sleep architecture of children with dyslexia in comparison with typical peers, using overnight sleep EEG recordings (polysomnography) 5, 6. Notably, children with dyslexia showed unusually long periods of slow wave sleep and an increased number of sleep spindles. Slow wave sleep and spindles are related to language learning, most notably through promoting the consolidation of new vocabulary 7. Children with dyslexia have pronounced deficits in learning new oral vocabulary, providing a plausible theoretical link between sleep disturbances and language difficulties. If sleep problems do in fact exacerbate the learning difficulties associated with dyslexia, as well as impacting on daily cognitive function, this could have important implications for intervention and support programs. However, an important first step is to establish the nature and extent of sleep disturbances in dyslexia. Previous studies 5, 6 have used small samples (N = <30) and examined a large array of sleep parameters on a small number of unusual nights (where children were wearing sleep recording equipment), as opposed to looking at global patterns over time. As such, how representative these findings are is questionable, and consequently these studies should be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing. Carotenuto et al. 3 address some of these concerns, administering questionnaire measures of sleep habits to the parents of 147 children with dyslexia and 766 children without dyslexia, aged 8–12 years. A sample of this size allows for a robust analysis of sleep characteristics. Therefore, their findings that children with dyslexia showed higher rates of several markers of sleep disorders lend significant weight to suggestions that dyslexia might be associated with an increased risk for sleep problems. Importantly, the sleep questionnaire used by Carotenuto et al. 3 allows for a breakdown of sleep disturbances. It is interesting to note that they found the greatest difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep, sleep breathing disorders and disorders of arousal. This closely mirrors the types of sleep problem documented in children with ADHD 8. While Carotenuto et al. 3 took care to exclude children with comorbid diagnoses, many children with dyslexia show subtle features of attention disorders that do not reach clinical thresholds. Future studies that can establish whether sleep disturbances are associated with subclinical attention problems or dyslexia per se will be particularly informative for understanding which cognitive skills most critically relate to sleep. This is also vital information for establishing whether information about sleep habits could have clinical relevance in the assessment and management of children with dyslexia. There are a number of ways in which Carotenuto et al.'s findings could be taken forward in future studies. Not least, the findings need to be replicated using more objective measures of sleep, including polysomnography and/or actigraphy, both of which can be administered in the home environment. It is notable that neither of the two polysomnography studies to date observed differences in sleep onset time or night-time awakenings in children with dyslexia compared with typical peers. Although this could be a result of a lack of statistical power due to the very small samples in these studies, the discrepancy could also be due to the subjective nature of the questionnaires used. Future studies must also take care to recruit samples that are free of referral bias. Carotenuto et al. recruited their sample via referrals to a hospital clinic; hence, it is possible that such children may be more likely to present with multiple issues (including sleep problems), rather than reading difficulty alone. Thus, it will be important to examine the prevalence of sleep difficulties in referred and nonreferred samples. Although Carotenuto et al. make substantial progress in establishing the frequency of sleep disorders in dyslexia, the study design cannot test causal hypotheses or establish whether there was a link between sleep difficulties and severity of reading impairment. Indeed, a great challenge in the field of sleep and developmental disorders is establishing the extent to which sleep is causally related to cognitive difficulties. It is possible that brain abnormalities associated with disorders can cause both cognitive and sleep differences without them being directly linked to each other. Moreover, sleep difficulties may simply be a consequence of increased anxiety associated with having a developmental disorder. Randomised controlled trials are often viewed as the gold standard means of establishing causality. For example, a recent study has shown that a sleep intervention for children with ADHD led to significant improvements in ADHD symptomatology and working memory 9. Given that the type of sleep problems encountered by children with dyslexia are similar to those in ADHD, it is tempting to propose that such an intervention may prove useful for children with dyslexia. However, it is important to be cautious: only 42% of the children with dyslexia in the Carotenuto et al. study suffered sleep difficulties. This indicates that while having dyslexia seems to greatly increase a child's risk of sleep problems, sleep disturbances are unlikely to represent a causal pathway to reading difficulties. Therefore, it is unlikely that a sleep intervention would be useful for all individuals with dyslexia. Nonetheless, it remains plausible that sleep difficulties could exacerbate cognitive and literacy difficulties in some children, who might then benefit from clinical intervention. If this is the case, then such interventions should be seen as complementary to literacy-targeted interventions that tackle the reading difficulty itself. Further research is needed to ascertain whether and how sleep difficulties contribute to the difficulties experienced by children with dyslexia, and to establish which children with dyslexia are at the greatest risk of sleep disturbances. Understanding the role of sleep in developmental disorders is vital, not only to improve assessment and treatment for affected children and families, but also to advance theoretical models of sleep and neurocognitive development. While sleep problems are common in several neurodevelopmental disorders, these problems are likely to differ qualitatively and quantitatively across children with different difficulties. Therefore, it is important to study sleep problems within each learning disorder as well as to look at the heterogeneity across the spectrum of learning difficulties. Studies such as the one by Carotenuto et al., which looks specifically at sleep in dyslexia, are crucial in this regard, raising awareness of the possible role of sleep difficulties and opening up a plethora of potential lines of future research in this area.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

Three patients developed RBD after acute inflammatory encephalitis, which lasted for 3 months to 1 year. They talked, moved and walked nightly while asleep. During night polysomnography, there were REM sleep without atonia and abnormally increased REM sleep as 37â87% of total sleep.

      "abstract": "The nervous system is crucial for coordinating body activities and cognitive functions. Disorders like epilepsy and Parkinson's disease significantly affect neurological health. Epilepsy is a chronic condition characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The pathophysiology involves various factors, including genetic mutations, structural brain abnormalities, and neurotransmitter imbalances. Epidemiologically, epilepsy affects about 50 million people worldwide. Symptoms range from brief lapses in attention to severe convulsions. Diagnosis is primarily through clinical history, EEG, and neuroimaging. Treatment includes antiepileptic drugs, lifestyle modifications, and in some cases, surgery. Complications can include injury during seizures, cognitive impairment, and social stigma. Prevention involves managing risk factors like head injuries and infections. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The pathophysiology involves the accumulation of Lewy bodies and a decrease in dopamine production, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. Epidemiologically, Parkinson’s disease affects about 1% of the population over 60. Symptoms include tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms can include depression, sleep disturbances, and cognitive decline. Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation, with imaging and response to dopaminergic therapy aiding in confirmation. Treatment focuses on symptomatic relief through medications like levodopa, dopamine agonists, and MAO-B inhibitors. Advanced cases may benefit from deep brain stimulation. Complications include worsening motor function, cognitive decline, and increased risk of falls. Prevention strategies are limited but may include lifestyle factors like regular exercise and a healthy diet to support overall brain health.",

Dysphagia is either part of the evolving clinical symptomatology of an underlying neurological autoimmunity or occurs as a sole manifestation, acutely or insidiously. This opinion article reviews the autoimmune neurological causes of dysphagia, highlights clinical clues and laboratory testing that facilitate early diagnosis, especially when dysphagia is the presenting symptom, and outlines the most effective immunotherapeutic approaches. Dysphagia is common in inflammatory myopathies, most prominently in inclusion body myositis, and is frequent in myasthenia gravis, occurring early in bulbar-onset disease or during the course of progressive, generalized disease. Acute-onset dysphagia is often seen in Guillain–Barre syndrome variants and slowly progressive dysphagia in paraneoplastic neuropathies highlighted by the presence of specific autoantibodies. The most common causes of CNS autoimmune dysphagia are demyelinating and inflammatory lesions in the brainstem, occurring in patients with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Less common, but often overlooked, is dysphagia in stiff-person syndrome especially in conjunction with cerebellar ataxia and high anti-GAD autoantibodies, and in gastrointestinal dysmotility syndromes associated with autoantibodies against the ganglionic acetyl-choline receptor. In the setting of many neurological autoimmunities, acute-onset or progressive dysphagia is a potentially treatable condition, requiring increased awareness for prompt diagnosis and early immunotherapy initiation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dyslexia is a disorder characterised by difficulty in learning to read that cannot be attributed to secondary organic, mechanical or social circumstances. In other words, a child fails to learn to read at an age‐appropriate rate, irrespective of intelligence level, education or other neurological deficits. Notably, developmental dyslexia – which is the focus of this article – is distinct from acquired dyslexia, which occurs due to brain trauma. Numerous sensory and cognitive deficits contribute to dyslexia, including difficulties with auditory processing of speech sounds, visual processing and working memory. Current research is aimed at understanding the neurobiological cause of these cognitive deficits. Key Concepts Dyslexia is a universal and persistent form of low literacy in which a child fails to learn to read at an age‐appropriate rate. It is found across languages and is not associated with intelligence, age, education or other neurological deficits. Symptoms of dyslexia and their severity can vary significantly from one individual to the next. People with dyslexia have been found to have Impaired phonological processing – that is, a decreased perceptual sensitivity to sound‐segments in language. Difficulties with short‐term memory. Impaired visual processing. Spelling difficulties. Phonological dyslexia refers to difficulties in sounding words out and making phonological manipulations. Surface dyslexia refers to difficulties in developing and accessing a lexicon, that is a mental representation of words. Dyslexia is often confused with visual stress – the symptoms of which include words moving when attempting to read, shimmering or disappearing, words looking like they were carved into the page, lines or rivers through the text, and preferring to read under very low light levels. The exact aetiology of dyslexia is unknown; however, evidence indicates deficits in magnocellular‐dorsal stream processing in the visual domain and impaired brainwave function in the auditory domain. Several genetic mutations have also been identified in dyslexia. Current remedial interventions for dyslexia are educational and are aimed at improving cognitive deficits. Current research is aimed at identifying the neurobiological basis of dyslexia to aid the development of a treatment that targets the underlying neurobiological cause of dyslexia.",

      "title": "Cognitive functions in children with cerebellar malformations",
      "abstract": "In the last few years the role of the cerebellum has been increasingly demonstrated, not only in the coordination of movements and control of posture, but also in cognitive functions. Cerebellar involvement in cognitive processes has been best characterized by Schmahmann and Sherman in adults.1 They described cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS), which involves the disturbances of executive functions, impaired spatial cognition, linguistic difficulties, and personality changes. Acquired focal cerebellar lesions represent the best models in which to study cognitive functions in paediatric cerebellar disorders. In children with low-grade cerebellar astrocytoma several studies demonstrated visuospatial, language sequencing, and memory problems.2 Cognitive impairment has also been reported in cerebellar malformations. In Joubert syndrome and related disorders, developmental delay and/or cognitive impairment are considered to be key features, while normal cognitive functions are exceptional. Despite normal Full-scale IQ (IQ=93), one patient showed specific difficulties in visuospatial organization and in some executive functions.3 This pattern of deficits is partly reminiscent of CCAS. In rhombencephalosynapsis, cognitive functions are mostly impaired at a level of mild intellectual impairment, but without a typical cognitive profile.4 Additionally, behavioural problems such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder are frequent. In children with non-progressive congenital ataxia detailed neurocognitive examinations revealed significant cognitive deficits affecting, particularly, attention, processing speed, and visuospatial functions.2 The study of cognitive functions in cerebellar malformations presents some difficulties: (1) cerebellar malformations are rare (Joubert syndrome is one of the most frequent cerebellar malformations and its estimated prevalence is 1:100.000); (2) severe cognitive impairment may disable a formal IQ assessment; and (3) typical clinical signs such as limb ataxia, dysarthria, or abnormal eye movements may impair the performance of neurocognitive tasks. In the view of these difficulties, the cohort of patients reported by Bolduc et al.5 is remarkable (n=49). Although the small number of children in the various diagnostic subgroups and their young age are limitations of this study, the authors present interesting and important findings. Cognitive functions were impaired in 39% of patients with different cerebellar malformations. This finding confirms the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in patients with cerebellar malformations compared with the total population (1.5%).6 Visual reception and expressive language were particularly affected. Additionally, both internalizing and externalizing behavioural disorders could be found in 25% and 15% of the patients respectively. Involvement of visual reception and expressive language as well as behavioural disorders are again reminiscent of CCAS. In cerebellar malformations, CCAS seems to be less specific than in patients with postnatally acquired cerebellar lesions. The authors found that severity of cognitive impairment correlated well with associated supratentorial abnormalities and severity of vermian malformation (e.g. patients with Dandy-Walker malformation and Joubert syndrome generally showed more severe cognitive impairment). This finding suggests that the volume of the cerebellar vermis and the involvement of other anatomical structures may play a significant role in cognitive functions. Patients with non-progressive congenital ataxia may show the same spectrum of neurocognitive impairment, but in these patients the brain anatomy is usually normal. Therefore, structural abnormalities cannot be the only explanation for the neurocognitive impairment in children with congenital cerebellar disorders. Recently, functional disruption of the white matter tracts containing efferent axons within the superior cerebellar peduncles has been shown to be a critical pathopysiological component of posterior fossa syndrome.7 This suggests that abnormalities of the white matter tracts connecting the cerebellum with the brainstem and cerebral hemispheres may impair neurocognitive functions in children with cerebellar disorders. Diffusion tensor imaging is an innovative magnetic resonance imaging technique allowing the qualitative and quantitative study of the white matter tracts in the cerebro-cerebello-connection.8 The study of the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathways in children with cerebellar malformations may increase our understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognitive functions.",

      "title": "Clinical Features and Revised Diagnostic Criteria in Joubert Syndrome",
      "abstract": "The clinical presentation of children with Joubert syndrome can include nonspecific features such as hypotonia, ataxia, and developmental delay. Careful examination of the face shows a characteristic appearance, and a neuro-ophthalmologic examination shows the presence of oculomotor apraxia. In the neonatal period, most children have hyperpnea intermixed with central apnea. Neuroimaging of the head in the axial plane demonstrates the \"molar tooth sign\"—deep posterior interpeduncular fossa, thick and elongated superior cerebellar peduncles, and hypoplastic or aplastic superior cerebellar vermis. The central nervous system malformation spectrum observed in radiologic and neuropathologic studies accounts for many clinical features of Joubert syndrome. The developmental delay and cognitive impairment cannot be fully explained by the hindbrain malformation and probably result from dysfunction of the cerebral hemispheres. Although related conditions with vermian hypoplasia or aplasia (including Arima; Senior-Loken; and cerebellar vermian hypoplasia, oligophrenia, congenital ataxia, coloboma, and hepatic fibrosis syndromes) can mimic Joubert syndrome, detailed imaging data are lacking in such cases. We propose a revision in diagnostic criteria for Joubert syndrome. (J Child Neurol 1999;14:583-591).",

      "abstract": "As with all aspects of the neurological examination, important clues come from a thorough and appropriate history. In relation to eye movement disorders the patients may be complaining of double vision, in which case they should be asked whether it is constant or intermittent; does it occur, or is it maximal, in certain directions of gaze; what is the relationship of one image with the other; and have they tried covering one eye and did that relieve the symptom? A less frequently reported symptom is oscillopsia, an illusion of movement of stationary objects, when enquiries need to be made whether the movement is horizontal or vertical, and does it become maximally apparent in certain positions of gaze, as for example in downbeat nystagmus when the oscillopsia is maximal on down gaze. Nystagmus will not be described here and has been covered in a previous article in Practical Neurology .1\n\nThe first part of any examination is observation and again this may provide clues to the diagnosis. Look out for abnormal head postures, turns or tilts, the latter typically occurring in an isolated trochlear nerve palsy; abnormal patterns of eye–head coordination, such as the head thrusts seen in ocular motor apraxia; abnormalities of the eyelids such as ptosis in an oculomotor palsy and myasthenia gravis, or retraction as is seen in thyroid ophthalmopathy and progressive supranuclear palsy.\n\nWe are now ready to examine the eye movements, hopefully with the benefit of some clues to the diagnosis already obtained from the history and simple observation of the patient.\n\n### Ocular misalignment\n\nFirst ask the patient to look at a distant object and observe any obvious ocular misalignment or abnormal, spontaneous eye movements. If one eye is deviated inward relative to the other this is referred to as an esotropia , whereas if there is …",

      "title": "Exploration of sleep disorders in the elderly: which particularities?",
      "abstract": "There are many reasons to take into consideration the sleep disorders in the elderly. The sleep quality degrades with age and is strongly affected by medical conditions, intrinsic sleep disorders, or by a combination of these factors. Other age-related conditions such as severe dementia, dependence or living in institution worsen sleep disturbances in older people. When living alone elderly people, being cognitively impaired and medically disabled, may not be able to complain about sleep problems. Sleep disorders are thus underdiagnosed, unmarked, and insufficiently investigated in the elderly. In this heterogeneous population, sleep assessment should include a global geriatric approach and be individually adapted for each subject. The sleep interview must specially include medical comorbidities, medication uses, and aged-related changes of lifestyle such as retirement, loss of spouse, hospitalization or institutionalization. In the elderly with loss of autonomy, standard sleep assessment is not always adequate and must be replaced by shorter, simpler or observation-based tests such as the Sleep disorders inventory, Observation-based nocturnal sleep inventory, Observation and interview based diurnal sleepiness inventory. When sleep log is impossible, actimetry is an excellent alternative for studying sleep-wake rhythm. Ventilatory polygraphy is a simpler test for detecting sleep apnea than polysomnography. Utilization of sophisticated investigations should be discussed when the feasibility and usefulness is limited.",

RBD and associated comorbidities have recently been identified as one of the most specific and potentially sensitive risk factors for later development of any of the alpha-synucleinopathies: Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and other atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Several other sleep-related abnormalities have recently been identified in patients with RBD/Parkinson's disease who experience abnormalities in sleep electroencephalographic frequencies, sleep-wake transitions, wake and sleep stability, occurrence and morphology of sleep spindles, and electrooculography measures. These findings suggest a gradual involvement of the brainstem and other structures, which is in line with the gradual involvement known in these disorders. We propose that these findings may help identify biomarkers of individuals at high risk of subsequent conversion to parkinsonism.",

      "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and parkinsonism. DLB is the second most common type of degenerative dementia of all dementia cases. However, DLB, particularly in the early stage, is underdiagnosed and sometimes misdiagnosed with other types of dementia. Thus, it is of great interest investigating neurophysiological markers of DLB.We introduced exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA)-independent component analysis (ICA) to assess activities of 5 electroencephalography (EEG) resting-state networks (RSNs) in 41 drug-free DLB patients.Compared to 80 healthy controls, DLB patients had significantly decreased activities in occipital visual and sensorimotor networks, where DLB patients and healthy controls showed no age dependences in all EEG-RSN activities. Also, we found correlations between all EEG-RSN activities and DLB symptoms. Specifically, decreased occipital α activity showed correlations with worse brain functions related to attention/concentration, visuospatial discrimination, and global cognition. Enhanced visual perception network activity correlated with milder levels of depression and anxiety. Enhanced self-referential network activity correlated with milder levels of depression. Enhanced memory perception network activity correlated with better semantic memory, visuospatial discrimination function, and global cognitive function as well as with severer visual hallucination. In addition, decreased sensorimotor network activity correlated with a better semantic memory.These results indicate that eLORETA-ICA can detect EEG-RSN activity alterations in DLB related to symptoms. Therefore, eLORETA-ICA with EEG data can be a useful noninvasive tool for sensitive detection of EEG-RSN activity changes characteristic of DLB and for understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this disease.",

      "title": "Integrated pathophysiology of schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder as monoamine axon disorder",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide evidence that similar to early-stage Parkinson’s disease, depression is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of monoamine axons. The major difference between the two disorders is that the symptoms of depression become evident without loss of monoamine neurons, while the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease appear after loss of the cell body. Given that the axonal degeneration of monoamine neurons underlies the pathophysiology of neurological (Parkinson’s disease) and neuropsychiatric (depression) diseases, axonal impairment of monoamine neurons is thought to also occur in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and play a significant role in the pathophysiology of these mental illnesses. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia and manic symptoms of bipolar disorder are known to occur in hyper-monoaminergic states, opposite to depressive symptoms, negative/cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, and motor disorders of Parkinson’s disease, all occurring in hypo-monoaminergic states. Since monoamine axons have the capacity to spontaneously regenerate or sprout in response to damage in the adult brain and sometimes show hyperinnervation due to excessive regeneration/sprouting beyond normal levels, it is possible that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are disorders that include excessive regeneration/sprouting of monoamine axons leading to hyper-monoaminergic states. Together, based on accumulating data from animal and human studies, the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder is summarized as follows: The degeneration of monoamine axons is associated with the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, major and bipolar depression, while hyper-regeneration/sprouting of monoamine axons underlies the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar mania. The integrated understanding of schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder as monoamine axon disorder will open the door to the development of new diagnosis and treatment methods for major mental illnesses as well as early-stage Parkinson’s disease.",

Ageing affects many cellular processes that predispose to neurodegeneration, and age-related changes in cellular function predispose to the pathogenesis of PD. The accumulation of age-related somatic damage combined with a failure of compensatory mechanisms may lead to an acceleration of PD with age. The formation of Lewy bodies may represent a marker for protective mechanisms against age-related dysfunction and degeneration of the nervous system. Mild parkinsonian signs may be present in older people, which are associated with reduced function. These may be due to age-related decline in dopaminergic activity, incidental Lewy body disease, degenerative pathologies (early PD and Alzheimer’s disease) or vascular pathology. Ageing may affect the clinical presentation of PD with altered drug side effects, increased risk of developing dementia and an increased likelihood of admission to a nursing home. Progression of PD, including the development of dementia, and hallucinations is related to the age of the patient rather than the age of disease onset. PD may reflect a failure of the normal cellular compensatory mechanisms in vulnerable brain regions, and this vulnerability is increased by ageing. PD is one of the best examples of an age-related disease.",

      "abstract": "Aim Clinical staging in psychiatry aims to classify patients according to the severity of their symptoms, from stage 0 (increased risk, asymptomatic) to stage 4 (severe illness), enabling adapted treatment at each stage of the illness. The staging model would gain specificity if one or more quantifiable biological markers could be identified. Several biomarkers reflecting possible causal mechanisms and/or consequences of the pathophysiology are candidates for integration into the clinical staging model of psychiatric illnesses. Methods This review covers the evolution (from stage 0 to stage 4) of the most important brain functioning impairments as measured with electroencephalography (EEG), in psychosis spectrum and in severe mood disorders. Results The present review of the literature demonstrates that it is currently not possible to draw any conclusion with regard to the state or trait character of any of the EEG impairments in both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. As for schizophrenia, the most promising markers of the stage of the illness are the pitch mismatch negativity as well as the p300 event‐related potentials, as these components seem to deteriorate with increasing severity of the illness. Conclusions Given the complexity of major psychiatric disorders, and that not a single impairment can be observed in all patients, future research should most likely consider combinations of markers in the quest for a better identification of the stages of the psychiatric illnesses.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is defined as difficulties of initiating and maintaining sleep, early awakening and poor subjective sleep quality despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep with impairment of daytime performance. These components of insomnia – namely persistent sleep difficulties despite of adequate sleep opportunity resulting in daytime dysfunction - appear secondary or co-morbid to neurological diseases. Comorbid insomnia originates from neurodegenerative, inflammatory, traumatic or ischemic changes in sleep regulating brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei with consecutive changes of neurotransmitters. Symptoms of neurological disorders (i.e motor deficits), co-morbidities (i.e. pain, depression, anxiety) and some disease-specific pharmaceuticals may cause insomnia and/or other sleep problems. This guideline focuses on insomnias in headaches, neurodegenerative movement disorders, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, epilepsies, stroke, neuromuscular disease and dementia. The most important new recommendations are: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBTi) is recommended to treat acute and chronic insomnia in headache patients. Insomnia is one of the most frequent sleep complaints in neurodegenerative movement disorders. Patients may benefit from CBTi, antidepressants (trazodone, doxepin), melatonin and gaba-agonists. Insomnia is a frequent precursor of MS symptoms by up to 10 years. CBTi is recommended in patients with MS, traumatic brain injury and. Melatonin may improve insomnia symptoms in children with epilepsies. Patients with insomnia after stroke can be treated with benzodiazepine receptor agonists and sedating antidepressants. For patients with dementia suffering from insomnia trazodone, light therapy and physical exercise are recommended.",

      "abstract": "Sudden changes in behaviour and concentration problems can be caused by non-convulsive status epilepticus. This generalised form of epilepsy can be easily missed as a diagnosis. In this case report series we describe three adolescent boys (13, 14 and 17 years old respectively) presenting with behavioural disturbances caused by idiopathic non-convulsive status epilepticus. The diagnosis was confirmed by electroencephalography (EEG). The medical history mentioned previous episodes of changes in behaviour in all patients. The 14-year-old boy was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is questionable whether this diagnosis was justified, or whether his behavioural problems were caused by non-convulsive epileptic seizures. Non-convulsive status epilepticus is characterised by diminished cognitive functioning in an otherwise reactive patient. Testing of memory and other cognitive functions is essential for diagnosis. All children with behavioural problems should undergo a thorough neurological assessment by a paediatrician or neurologist in order to recognise non-convulsive epilepsy.",

      "title": "Disorders of Excessive Sleepiness: Narcolepsy and Hypersomnia",
      "abstract": "Besides sleep apnea, the main disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness include narcolepsy and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy is characterized by periods of irresistible sleepiness and sleep attacks of brief duration and, most often, by one or more of the auxiliary symptoms: cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnogogic hallucinations. Generally, sleepiness and sleep attacks in hypersomnia are of longer duration and are more resistible than in narcolepsy; also, the auxiliary symptoms are absent. There are three types of hypersomnia: idiopathic, secondary, and periodic. Nocturnal sleep is typically disrupted in narcolepsy, whereas in idiopathic hypersomnia it is prolonged and in secondary hypersomnia it is variable. The exact causes of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are unknown; however, there is evidence for genetic predisposition for either disorder. In secondary hypersomnia causative factors include: neurologic, such as head injuries, cerebrovascular insufficiency, and brain tumors; general medical, such as metabolic disorders, various intoxications, and conditions leading to brain hypoxia; and psychiatric, most notably depression. Although the cause of periodic hypersomnia is unclear, most research supports the notion of underlying organic disease. Often, the evaluation of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness can be completed in the office setting, based on the sleep history and a thorough neurologic, general medical, and psychiatric assessment. Whenever indicated, ancillary laboratory studies, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans, should be performed. Sleep laboratory recordings generally are not necessary unless there is suspicion of sleep apnea or narcolepsy in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Ocular manifestations in the X-linked intellectual disability syndromes",
      "abstract": "Intellectual disability (ID), a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by limitations of both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior, affects an estimated 1–2% of children. Genetic causes of ID are often accompanied by recognizable syndromal patterns. The vision apparatus is a sensory extension of the brain, and individuals with intellectual disabilities frequently have coexisting abnormalities of ocular structures and the visual pathway system. About one-third of the X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndromes have significant eye or ocular adnexa abnormalities that provide important diagnostic clues. Some XLID syndromes (e.g. Aicardi, cerebrooculogenital, Graham anophthalmia, Lenz, Lowe, MIDAS) are widely known for their characteristic ocular manifestations. Nystagmus, optic atrophy, and strabismus are among the more common, nonspecific, ocular manifestations that contribute to neuro-ophthalmological morbidity. Common dysmorphic oculofacial findings include anophthalmia, microphthalmia, hypertelorism, and abnormalities in the configuration or orientation of the palpebral fissures. Four XLID syndromes with major ocular manifestations (incontinentia pigmenti, Goltz, MIDAS, and Aicardi syndromes) are notable because of male lethality and expression occurring predominantly in females. The majority of the genes associated with XLID and ocular manifestations have now been identified.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ARID1B-related disorder (ARID1B-RD) constitutes a clinical continuum, from classic Coffin-Siris syndrome to intellectual disability with or without nonspecific dysmorphic features. Coffin-Siris syndrome is classically characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth and additional digits, developmental or cognitive delay of varying degree, distinctive facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. Frequencies of other features, such as developmental delay (with speech often more affected than motor development), is consistent across the clinical spectrum, and may include malformations of the cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and/or central nervous systems. Other findings seen in individuals with ARID1B-RD include feeding difficulties, slow growth, ophthalmologic abnormalities, hearing impairment, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autistic features. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ARID1B-RD is established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ARID1B by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for strabismus, refractive error, hearing loss, congenital heart defects, obstructive sleep apnea, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, cryptorchidism, scoliosis, and seizure disorders. For significant feeding issues, a nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tube may be required. Developmental therapies, including speech/language and feeding therapy, is recommended for those with developmental delay. Surveillance: At least annual assessment of developmental progress and educational needs; annual ophthalmology evaluation and assessment for scoliosis (until growth is complete). Audiology evaluation, behavior assessment, and hormonal evaluation/bone age as needed based on symptoms. Those with seizures should be monitored as clinically indicated. Genetic counseling ARID1B-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. With the exception of two families in which a parent and child had features consistent with ARID1B-related disorder, all individuals diagnosed to date have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Once the ARID1B pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

The symptoms in melancholia being of a negative character due to a lowering or suspension of brain activity, we do not look for all those diversities, endless varieties and aspects which we may find in mania, be it simple, acute, or chronic. Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view. If this increased activity does not rapidly terminate in resolution, one of two things must occur—either exhaustion or atrophy, resulting in death or dementia, will supervene, or abnormal tissue will invade or replace healthy nerve paths or areas, and chronic aberration of mind ensue.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce.

      "abstract": "The commonality of cognitive impairment and depression is discussed. Cognitive symptoms are the main symptoms of depressive disorder and, most often, it is cognitive impairment that reduces the performance and quality of life of depressed patients. The most common cognitive disorders in depressed patients are: attention deficit (both visual and auditory), decrease in the level of short-term and operative memory, difficulties in processing information of any modality, a decrease in the speed of information processing, as well as difficulties in building an activity program and monitoring her execution. A cognitive symptom that requires further discussion is the so-called cognitive distortion – a shift in focus from positive to negative stimuli, as well as incorrect reactions to negative feedback and decision making. A depressive episode develops against the background of dysmetabolic and dysfunctional cerebral changes in the amygdala, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, orbitofrontal and mediobasal frontal cortex. Cognitive impairment in patients who have had depression persists after recovery from depression; according to the figurative expression adopted in the scientific community of specialists studying cognitive impairment in depression, each depressive episode forms permanent “cognitive scars”. Presumably, cognitive dysfunction may be one of the risk factors for the development of a depressive disorder; depression, in turn, is a risk factor for the development of dementia, including in Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease: studies have shown that the transformation of severe cognitive impairment associated with depression into dementia in elderly patients can reach 70% in five years. The undoubted commonality of depression and cognitive dysfunction is emphasized by the frequency of depression in patients with cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and affect the health of billions of people. Previous publications have demonstrated that neuropsychiatric disorders can cause histomorphological damage in particular regions of the brain. By using a clinical symptom-comparing approach, 55 neuropsychiatric signs or symptoms related usually to 14 types of acute and chronic brain insults were identified and categorized in the present study. Forty percent of the 55 neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms have been found to be commonly shared by the 14 brain insults. A meta-analysis supports existence of the same neuropsychiatric signs or symptoms in all brain insults. The results suggest that neuronal damage might be occurring in the same or similar regions or structures of the brain. Neuronal cell death, neural loss and axonal degeneration in some parts of the brain (the limbic system, basal ganglia system, brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex) might be the histomorphological basis that is responsible for the neuropsychiatric symptom clusters. These morphological alterations may be the result of secondary neuronal damage (a cascade of progressive neural injury and neuronal cell death that is triggered by the initial insult). Secondary neuronal damage causes neuronal cell death and neural injury in not only the initial injured site but also remote brain regions. It may be a major contributor to subsequent neuropsychiatric disorders following brain insults.",

In the more chronic, slowly progressive, or static conditions of encephalopathy, there may be retention of the attention initially with loss of cognitive capacity.Electroencephalography (EEG) is useful in evaluating patients with acute and chronic encephalopathies. The primary role is in differentiating the conditions associated with seizures. The various patterns detected with an EEG in encephalopathies are sensitive but usually not specific to a particular etiology. It is typically associated with a slowing of the cerebral activity and diffuse slow waveforms in the background. This could be secondary to the involvement of both the cortical neurons or the subcortical white matter dysfunction. Overall, EEG is useful for assessing the degree of cerebral dysfunction in encephalopathy and monitoring the changes along with clinical progression.",

The stirring of emotion has effect on encoding and consolidation. Explicit memory depends on medial temporal and prefrontal lobes. Priming impinges directly on cerebral cortex.

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder.Although it is classically defined by motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms including cognitive impairment (CI) are often even more disabling for patients.CI may happen in one or multiple cognitive domains, resulting in diverse profiles.Executive dysfunction and visuospatial impairment are two prominent and early cognitive symptoms.Visuospatial deficits are typically associated with atrophy in the parieto-temporal or parieto-frontal areas, precuneus, and hippocampus that may progress to dementia.Executive dysfunction in PD is typically associated with atrophy in the frontal (especially superior frontal gyrus) and parietal areas (especially temporoparietal areas), as well as white matter, changes cingulum, and parieto-frontal areas.Inconsistencies remain in understanding many factors that affect the manifestation of different PD-CI profiles.These factors include the relationship between neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging measures, as well as atrophy of brain areas such as the putamen or caudate nucleus, and the neural profile of different executive function or visuospatial symptoms.Factors related to disease severity, onset, and duration may play a role.In addition, the relationship between PD-CI and the multiple neurotransmitters involved in PD is not clear.PD is a heterogeneous disease, especially in terms of cognitive dysfunction.Diversity of manifested symptoms (i.e.different PD profiles) may be due to which cortico-subcortical pathways have been involved, or how severely they have been damaged and how far the disease has spread through those pathways.More neuroimaging studies with different analysis methods and focus on subdivisions of subcortical structures are required.",

Based on the underlying mechanisms, psychogenic (or functional) neurologic diseases are classified into three categories: conversion disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering. Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The visual function of 42 children with hacmorrhagic and/or ischaemic cerebral lesions acquired before a gestational age of 35 weeks was examined and related to cranial ultrasound in the neonatal period and to MR1 and neurodevelopmental status at follow‐up. All 37 children with abnormal ultrasound scans and one of the five with normal ultrasound scans showed impairment of one or more aspects of visual function. While impaired acuity was more frequent among infants with MRI evidence of visual pathway damage, this was not an invariable finding. Normal or near‐normal visual acuity did not preclude the presence of other functional visual deficits. The authors conclude that preterm cerebral insults may produce a variety of visual difficulties, the pattern and severity of which cannot be predicted on imaging. Each child therefore requires individual assessment of multiple aspects of visual function. RÉSUMÉ Troubles visuels associés aux lésions chez nourhsson prématuré La fonction visuelle de 42 enfants ayant présenté des lésions cérébrales hémorragiques et/ou ischémiques acquises avant un âge de gestation de 35 semaines a été examinée et reliéc aux échographies transcrâniennes (US) de la période néonatale et aux IRM d'une part, à I'état neurodevéloppemental du suivi d'autre part. Tous les 37 enfants avec anomalies échographiques et l'un des cinq avec échographie normale présentaient un déficit dans au moins un aspect de la fonction visuelle. Une acuite normale ou subnormale ne permettait pas d'augurer de la présence d'autres déficits de la fonction visuelle. Les auteurs concluent que les agressions cérébrales du prématuré peuvent produire toute une variété de troubles visuels, sans que l'allure ou la gravité puissent être directement reliées à l'imagerie. De ce fait, chaque enfant doit bénéficer d'une évaluation individuelle pour les multiples aspects de la fonction visuelle.

      "title": "[Sleep disorders and dementia].",
      "abstract": "A clinically relevant sleep-wake disturbance is found in up to half the patients with dementia, and the sundowning agitation is a common cause of institutionalisation of demented geriatric patients. The circadian rhythm of demented patients is levelled off with increased daytime sleep and disrupted night sleep. Particularly in vascular dementia, Korsakow syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and depression the alteration of sleep architecture may be pronounced, whereas in Alzheimer's disease prominent hypersomnolence or insomnia is typically only found in later stages of the diseases. Greatly increased daytime sleepiness or striking insomnia at the very beginning of suspected dementia should thus prompt the search for other, possibly treatable causes of dementia. Neuropathological and neurophysiological studies support the hypothesis of a deteriorated hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (harbouring the biological clock) as a cause for the deranged circadian sleep-wake system in dementia. Management of sundowning behaviour includes restriction of daytime sleep, exposure to bright lights, and social interaction schedules during the day. The benzodiazepines and analogues usually not being sufficiently effectual, low doses of mild neuroleptics are often needed. Whether recent reports on efficacy of melatonin in elderly insomniacs also apply to demented patients is yet uncertain. The careful search and treatment of possible extracerebral physiologic factors causing reversible hypersomnia or insomnia is an important requisite. Polysomnographic studies are needed to recognise treatable sleep disturbance which could deteriorate or mimic dementia and sundowning. Particularly, a sleep-apnea-hypopnea syndrome must be searched for at the beginning of a suspected dementia, when successful treatment is still possible. Sleep studies should also identify periodic leg movements of sleep with restless legs and/or increased daytime sleepiness, and hyperkinetic parasomnias such as REM sleep behaviour disorder which may complicate or imitate sundowning.",

      "title": "Late life depression with cognitive impairment: Evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Older adults with depression often present with signs and symptoms indicative of functional or cognitive impairment. These somatic symptoms make evaluating and treating depression in older adults more complex. Late life depression (LLD), depression in adults over the age of 65, is more frequently associated with cognitive changes. Cognitive impairment in LLD may be a result of the depressive disorder or an underlying dementing condition. Memory complaints are also common in older adults with depression. There is a wide range of cognitive impairment in LLD including decreased central processing speed, executive dysfunction, and impaired short-term memory. The etiology of cognitive impairment in LLD may include cerebrovascular disease, a significant risk factor for LLD, which likely interrupts key pathways between frontal white matter and subcortical structures important in mood regulation. Because depressive symptoms often coexist with dementia, it is important to determine the temporal relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive change. If depressive symptoms pre-date the cognitive impairment and cognitive symptoms are mild and temporary, LLD is the likely etiology of the cognitive impairment. If cognitive changes appear prior to depressive symptoms and persist after LLD is successfully treated, an underlying dementia is more likely. Clinicians should be exclude common conditions such as thyroid disease which can contribute to depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment prior to treating LLD. Both antidepressants and psychotherapy can be effective in treating LLD. Subsequent evaluations following treatment should also reassess cognition.",

      "abstract": "It has been estimated that 6% to 7% of school-aged children manifest poor coordination.1 Clinicians will rarely identify the presence of this type of disability from their findings during routine physical and neurologic examinations. What is required is careful observation of the child during performance of fine and gross developmental motor tasks. It is infrequent that parents will express concern to the pediatrician, unless they have clues from nursery school or grade school teachers, coaches, peers, or, occasionally, from the child him- or herself. The child is usually the first one to be aware of motor limitations, especially when he or she is in competition with children of the same age. Unfortunately, the child does not usually verbalize his or her concern but will refrain from participating in competitive motor activities to conceal motor inadequacies. DEFINITION The term \"clumsy child\" refers to a boy or girl who performs fine and/or gross motor tasks in an immature, disorganized, erratic, slow, irregular, or inconsistent fashion. The relevant motor skills are imprecise rather than grossly impaired and the neurologic examination does not reveal significant postural disabilities or involuntary movements. SIGNIFICANCE A pediatrician should not minimize the significance of clumsiness. It is frequently associated with other evidence of cerebral dysfunction, such as cognitive and/or perceptual impairments that may result in learning disabilities.",

      "title": "Primary progressive aphasia: A dementia of the language network",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome diagnosed when three core criteria are met. First, there should be a language impairment (i.e., aphasia) that interferes with the usage or comprehension of words. Second, the neurological work-up should determine that the disease is neurodegenerative, and therefore progressive. Third, the aphasia should arise in relative isolation, without equivalent deficits of comportment or episodic memory. The language impairment can be fluent or non-fluent and may or may not interfere with word comprehension. Memory for recent events is preserved although memory scores obtained in verbally mediated tests may be abnormal. Minor changes in personality and behavior may be present but are not the leading factors that bring the patient to medical attention or that limit daily living activities. This distinctive clinical pattern is most conspicuous in the initial stages of the disease, and reflects a relatively selective atrophy of the language network, usually located in the left hemisphere. There are different clinical variants of PPA, each with a characteristic pattern of atrophy. The underlying neuropathological diseases are heterogeneous and can include Alzheimer's disease as well as frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The clinician's task is to recognize PPA and differentiate it from other neurodegenerative phenotypes, use biomarkers to surmise the nature of the underlying neuropathology, and institute the most fitting multimodal interventions.",

The first purpose of the present study was to compare cognitive and motor function in 25 heavy nonapneic snorers and 26 sleep apneics. As the basis for impairments in heavy nonapneic snorers is still unclear, the influence of nighttime breathing disturbances and morning alertness, respectively, on daytime performance was evaluated too. Nonapneic snorers exhibit more slow wave sleep and tend to have fewer changes in sleep stage than sleep apnea patients, but values for other sleep variables are similar. Snorers also show comparable alertness. Deficits in immediate visual memory and in visuospatial reasoning are not found. However, there are some indications that snorers show decreased manual dexterity and eye-hand coordination for the nonpreferred hand and that they have deficits in focused attention. In addition, snorers may show difficulties in finger-tapping speed. These performance measures tend to be associated with reduced morning alertness, except for the score on focused attention which has a tendency to be related to the nocturnal breathing disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Diplopia or double vision is a frequent reason for ophthalmology consultation. Monocular diplopia is usually ocular or retinal in origin, whereas binocular diplopia is often due to neurological causes. Detailed history beginning with any childhood visual disorders or head tilt and covering comorbid conditions and drug intake is essential. The alignment of images and direction of maximum separation point to the muscle(s) are involved. Temporal profile including onset, progression, and fluctuations along with comorbid conditions helps to narrow down the etiology. Refraction, ocular examination, and fundoscopy can identify ocular and retinal conditions; meticulous examination of ocular ductions and versions is mandatory to localize the cause of diplopia and to initiate investigations for the underlying disease process. Isolated ocular motor palsies are mostly due to microvascular ischemia; in the absence of red flags, investigation may be deferred for 6–8 weeks. Large vertical fusional amplitudes may be a clue to a decompensated congenital trochlear palsy. A partial third nerve palsy with early pupillary involvement, progressive signs, involvement of multiple cranial nerves, and elderly patients with rapid Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) are some situations warranting early imaging and other investigation. Myasthenia gravis and thyroid disease may present with diplopia and ophthalmic manifestations alone without systemic symptomatology. Immunoglobulin G4-related orbital myositis and anti-GQ1b antibody-mediated ocular neuropathies are relatively recently recognized immune-mediated conditions that may present with diplopia to an ophthalmologist. Ophthalmoplegic migraine has been renamed recurrent ophthalmoplegic neuropathy and is a diagnosis of exclusion at initial presentation.",

The case of a hitherto healthy man is presented, who simultaneously developed narcolepsy and RBD as the result of an acute focal inflammatory lesion in the dorsomedial pontine tegmentum in the presence of normal cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels and in the absence of human lymphocyte antigen haplotypes typically associated with narcolepsy and RBD (DQB1*0602, DQB1*05).

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by severe and age-inappropriate levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder, and the majority of patients show comorbid or associated problems from other psychiatric disorders. Also, ADHD is associated with cognitive and motivational problems as well as resting-state abnormalities, associated with impaired brain activity in distinct neuronal networks. This needs to be considered in a multimodal treatment, of which neurofeedback may be a promising component. During neurofeedback, specific brain activity is fed-back using visual or auditory signals, allowing the participants to gain control over these otherwise unaware neuronal processes. Neurofeedback may be used to directly improve underlying neuronal deficits, and/or to establish more general self-regulatory skills that may be used to compensate behavioural difficulties. The current manuscript describes pathophysiological characteristics of ADHD, heterogeneity of ADHD subtypes and gender differences, as well as frequently associated behavioural problems such as oppositional defiant/conduct or tic disorder. It is discussed how neurofeedback may be helpful as a treatment approach within these contexts.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbance in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is common and can have a debilitating effect on quality of life due to the effects of daytime somnolence on cognition, motor function, potential for injury and capacity to manage activities of daily living. Sources of excessive daytime sleepiness in PD and DLB often include sleep fragmentation, side effects of medications, and sleep disorders that disrupt night-time sleep continuity. The parasomnia of REM sleep behavior disorder has also been shown to be an early feature of PD and DLB and a risk factor for dementia in PD. Dysfunction of the dopamine nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems is involved in Lewy body disease, but several other neurotransmitter systems have Lewy body pathology and neuronal loss that may be responsible for abnormal sleepiness and REM sleep behavior disorder in these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The neurologic results of cortical lesions reflect the structural properties of the affected region. Lesions affecting primary sensorimotor cortices result in primary sensorimotor deficits that are qualitatively all-or-nothing, such as blindness (hemianopia) and paralysis (hemiparesis). Quantitatively, though, the severity of the deficit depends on the extent of the lesion (so that a hemiparetic patient may not be completely paralyzed but simply weak). Lesions affecting modality-specific association regions result in conceptually more complex disorders that are confined to a single modality, such as nonfluent aphasia (a form of motor speech disorder reflecting the language-dominant hemisphere) or prosopagnosia (a visual disorder impairing the ability to disambiguate visually similar entities, specifically faces, reflecting the “what” visual pathway in inferotemporal cortices).",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

Her symptoms appeared in the past 1.5 years ago, while she had an episode of hypersomnia lasting for 5 days. She had 4 attacks; each one lasted up to 2-7 days.

      "abstract": "Patients with RR (n=45) and SP (n=24) types of multiple sclerosis (MS) were analyzed using original Luria neuropsychological battery. On the basis of the results obtained, the general characteristics of neuropsychological syndromes were determined: asthenic manifestations; certain violations of the auditory-speech memory; decreased visual memory; disorders of interhemispheric somatosensory transfer; violations of the simultaneous factor of the mental activity organization. It is shown that the progressive type of MS is characterized by a significantly greater degree of severity of the above disorders, as well as their certain qualitative features: a wider range of mnestic disorders; the presence of disturbances in the interhemispheric transfer of motor information; the presence of violations of the assessment of rhythmic sequences by ear; the presence of visual-constructive activity disorders. The factors that determine the neuropsychological syndrome structure in both categories of patients include: the activation factor associated with the work of nonspecific brain systems at all levels of organization, the factor of the simultaneous organization of mental activity associated with the work of the parietotemporal-occipital parts of the cerebral cortex, the factor of interhemispheric interaction. The qualitative differences between the groups of patients consist in the different influence of these factors on the formation of the structure of disorders.",

Although convulsive SE is recognized as a medical emergency, prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with NCSE is often not emphasized because its consequences are thought to be benign. We report 10 patients with persistent neurologic deficits or death after well-documented NCSE in the form of complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). All patients had prolonged CPSE lasting 36 hours or longer, as documented by clinical and EEG findings. Causes for CPSE were preexisting epilepsy with partial and secondarily generalized seizures (3 patients), vascular disease (2 patients), encephalitis (2 patients), and metabolic disease (1 patient); causes were unknown for two patients. Poor outcomes identified included persistent (lasting at least 3 months) or permanent cognitive or memory loss (5 patients), cognitive or memory loss plus motor and sensory dysfunction (3 patients), and death (3 patients). NCSE in the form of CPSE is not a benign entity. Serious morbidity and mortality may occur due to the adverse effects of prolonged seizures and as a result of acute brain disorders that precipitate the seizures.",

      "title": "Attention and Attentional Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Attention is a fundamental behavior. It comprises different processes and is integrally involved in diverse cognitive functions. Attention encompasses generalized activation of the cognitive processes of orienting, filtering, and selecting inputs; preparing for action; and maintaining thought on a stimulus, mental activity, or goal. Attention, a vital foundation for higher cognitive functions, maintains a coherent stream of thought. The ability to sustain attention, or vigilance, is necessary for complex behaviors, such as understanding and remembering a story. Therefore, attention must be tested first, before other cognitive functions. An inattentive patient’s failure to perform calculations sheds no light on arithmetic skills. Rather, attentional dysfunction is a central feature of syndromes due to diffuse cerebral dysfunction such as delirium, as well as syndromes due to focal cerebral damage such as the neglect syndrome. In addition, attentional dysfunction often accompanies other cognitive impairments in such common neurological.",

      "title": "Functional Weakness and Sensory Loss",
      "abstract": "Functional weakness and sensory loss are common clinical problems with variable presentations. Functional weakness commonly presents as weakness of an entire limb, paraparesis, or hemiparesis, with observable or demonstrable inconsistencies and nonanatomic accompaniments. Documentation of limb movements during sleep, the arm drop test, the Babinski thigh-trunk test, Hoover tests, the Sonoo abductor test, and various dynamometer tests can provide useful bedside diagnostic information on functional weakness. Functional sensory loss typically affects all sensory modalities, either in a hemisensory distribution or affecting an entire limb. Although often inconsistent over serial examinations with nonanatomic features, many clinical findings reported to be helpful in diagnosing functional sensory loss are neither sensitive nor specific for functional sensory loss. The yes-no test, Bowlus-Currier test, and forced-choice tests can provide useful bedside diagnostic information on functional sensory loss. Clinicians must be prepared to make more than one diagnosis in some cases, including an organic neurological diagnosis and a diagnosis of functional overlay. Recent studies have reported relatively low rates (<5%) of misdiagnosis of functional weakness or sensory loss as indicated by subsequent diagnosis of neurological or psychiatric conditions that explained the presenting symptoms. Most neurologists find such patients more difficult to help than patients with organic disease. Management focuses on supportive psychotherapy and behavioral management, exploration of social and psychological issues, treatment of comorbid depression or anxiety, and facilitation of development of more appropriate and constructive coping methods. Many patients with functional weakness, and to a somewhat lesser extent functional sensory loss, have persisting or relapsing-remitting somatic symptoms and persistently impaired social/interpersonal, occupational, and psychological functioning.",

One of the difficulties in studying delirium is that symptoms tend to fluctuate over the course of the day. Pre-existing organic brain disease appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of delirium, and numerous studies have shown a high rate of delirium in patients with cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The cognitive deficits associated with delirium have not been widely studied in a systematic, quantitative fashion. Following resolution of the frank delirium, documented cognitive deficits can be observed, and may persist in a diluted form for a period of months.

Recent findings Insomnia, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are commonly reported in essential tremor, Wilson's disease, tics or Tourette's syndrome, and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) have been observed in Wilson's disease and SCA. A combination of REM and non-REM parasomnias, along with nocturnal stridor with the initiation of sleep and re-entering after awakening, are characterized by undifferentiated Non-REM and poorly structured N2 in anti-IgLON5 disease. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has been reported commonly in SCAs. Sleep-related dyskinesia has been reported in ADCY5-related disease and GNAO1-related movement disorder. Summary Sleep problems can manifest as a result of movement disorders, either through direct motor disturbances or secondary nonmotor symptoms. Medication effects must be considered, as certain medications for movement disorders can exacerbate or alleviate sleep disturbances.

      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

This compendium reflects an integrated research plan executed over a five year period, employing detailed, standardized phenomenological assessments cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Motor activity studies were controlled and included both subjective and objective measures, aimed at identifying a new approach to defining this clinical subtype as a more pure motor disturbance. This work confirms delirium as a complex neuropsychiatric disorder involving widespread dysfunction of higher cortical centres that includes core disturbances of cognition, higher level thinking and circadian rhythms. Although delirium is characterised as a unitary syndrome, not all symptoms follow the same trajectory over the course of an episode; non-cognitive symptoms are more fluctuating. Attention is characteristically disproportionately impaired, relatively less fluctuating, and a key indicator of delirium. Longer delirium episodes involve more prominence of cognitive symptoms. Delirium symptoms overshadow dementia symptoms whether or not these conditions co-occur. Impaired forward spatial span is especially discriminating between delirium and dementia. Motor activity disturbances are almost invariable in delirium and can distinguish clinical subtypes that are relatively stable over the course of an episode. These motor-defined subtypes have similar cognitive impairment severity but differ for noncognitive symptom expression and prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathy may be difficult to distinguish from neuronopathy, on both motor and sensory sides. A number of disorders that present with characteristic electro-clinical features are readily recognized. Except for those, distinction of the lesions that concern the peripheral nerve cell or the axon may require support of clinical, electrophysiological and other ancillary tests. Distinction between motor neuropathy and neuronopathy can be based on the abnormalities of nerve conduction and on the signs that relate to the reinnervation process. Signs of terminal axonal reinnervation, such as motor axon reflex, may be observed in axonal neuronopathies, whereas only collateral reinnervation occurs in motor neuronopathies. Sensory axonopathies are usually characterized by clinical and electrophysiological findings that are axon length-dependent, by the course of the disorder that is most often chronic, and by possible reversibility. Sensory neuronopathies are usually subacute and induce clinical deficits that are more or less widespread to the whole body surface rather than distal. Follow-up studies disclose limited or absent recovery. A better knowledge of the structural differences of motor and sensory neurons and axons will improve our understanding and lead to the development of specific tests. Meanwhile, although some parameters and techniques should still be improved, electrophysiological and additional tests are useful to detect and to distinguish the peripheral nerve disorders that affect the nerve cell bodies and their axons.",

Recent findings Current criteria for cognitive syndrome, including Alzheimer’s disease, comprise the neuropsychiatric symptoms in addition to cognitive and functional decline. Although there is growing evidence that neuropsychiatric symptoms may precede the prodromal stages of dementia, these manifestations have received less attention than traditional clinical hallmarks such as cognitive and functional deterioration. Depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, agitation, sleep disorders, among other symptoms, have been hypothesized to represent a prodromal stage of dementia or, at least, they increase the risk for conversion from minor neurocognitive disorder to major neurocognitive disorder. Longitudinal investigations have provided increased evidence of progression to dementia in individuals with minor neurocognitive disorder when neuropsychiatric symptoms also were present. Summary Although neuropsychiatric symptoms are strongly associated with a higher risk of cognitive and functional deterioration, frequently the clinician does not acknowledge these conditions as increasing the risk of dementia. When the clinician accurately diagnoses neuropsychiatric symptoms in the prodromal stage of dementia, he could early establish appropriate treatment and, may be, delay the beginning of clinical and functional deterioration.",

      "title": "Bipolar disorder: multiple pathways to neuroprogression",
      "abstract": "People with bipolar disorder can thrive or fail to thrive. Which path they take can depend on many factors – age of onset, early trauma, severity of illness overall (number, frequency, and severity of mood episodes), inter-episodic symptoms, comorbid conditions, cognitive dysfunction, social support, diet, sleep hygiene, smoking, and even the neurotic syndrome. If one carefully examines the extant literature on the course of bipolar disorder, one will find a simple and rather uninteresting relationship: People with a greater burden of illness have a more difficult course. The more interesting question is: Beyond severity, why do some people thrive while others do not? In the past few years, a provocative hypothesis has been proposed by thoughtful researchers that people with bipolar disorder who fail to thrive experience a degeneration of their brains – with loss of dendrites, synapses, neurons, astrocytes, and glial cells over time, that is, a progression of neurotoxicity, a loss of neuroplasticity, a neuroprogression. The testable hypothesis is that neuroprogression is the cause of a worse bipolar course or at least a correlate – but what caused what? Did the neuroprogression precede the worse course or did the worse course cause the neuroprogression? One of the great dangers that researchers face is that they can fall in love with their hypotheses. If one postulates neuroprogression, then one can see it everywhere, a confirmation bias that leads to finding supportive and ignoring contradictory evidence. But like good writers, good researchers should be willing to fall out of love with their hypotheses and as William Faulkner said, ‘In writing you must kill all your darlings’. Passos and colleagues, some of whom have been great proponents of the neuroprogression hypothesis, have looked at the data on neuroprogression and have found that the evidence is quite mixed, perhaps not enough to ‘kill their darling’ but enough to call into question an overarching neuroprogression hypothesis 1. They found a large hole in the evidence for neuroprogression, that is, that most of the data are cross-sectional and not longitudinal. These data are subject to bias and if the hypothesis is to be tested, longitudinal studies of biological features of bipolar disorder are needed and are lacking. The specific bias inherent in examining cross-sectional data resides in the problem of determining causality as mentioned above – did those patients who have early or premorbid evidence of neuroprogression (cognitive dysfunction, reduced volumes in selected relevant brain areas) subsequently have a worse course of the disorder or did those who have a worse course of bipolar disorder have a greater allostatic load and systemic toxicity 2 that, in turn, caused neuroprogression? An important link to consider is allostatic load. Allostatic load represents a cumulative total body response to stress, elegantly studied and reviewed by Bruce McEwen 3, 4. It seems unnecessary and trivial to postulate that stress is bad for brain health. We all know that. In contrast, it is worthwhile to explore the details about how stress gets transduced into neurobiological changes which can lead to damage to neurons. Familiar to many readers of Acta, acute stress increases glucocorticoid levels – and acute increases may actually be neuroprotective – but sustained or repeated stress results in sustained increases of glucocorticoid levels as well as glutamate levels, resulting in neurotoxicity. Sustained stress also downregulates a wide swath of neuroprotective genes – including BDNF, VEGF – with associated decreases in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, especially in the hippocampus as evidenced by reduced volume and function. Early trauma, in contrast to sustained stress, also dysregulates one's response to stress so that subsequent stressors cause more distress, in part because of the ‘harmonics’ of the past echo into the present – that is, a current stimulus acts as a trigger for past traumatic stimuli and people react to the present as if it were a replay of the past – with a possible biological explanation due to faulty pattern separation and pattern completion which is dependent on neurogenesis in the hippocampus 5. Remarkably, early trauma can permanently change one's response to stress, leading to hyperarousal and hypervigilance and sustained stress. The final aspect of allostatic load is that an imbalance of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines occurs with profound implications for overall survival – sustained inflammation affects multiple organs and can lead to premature death. Perhaps the reason that people with bipolar disorder can lose up to 25 years of life, mostly from cardiovascular disease, is because of inflammation secondary to allostatic load and stress. For those who have bipolar disorder, episodes of major depression or mania are disruptive and stressful. If they had stressors prior to the onset of bipolar disorder, early trauma, or ongoing difficulties, this type of stress would compromise their ability to cope with those mood episodes – and then experiencing those mood episodes would be that much more stressful. And if they had preexisting aspects of neuroprogression, then we could postulate that the markers of neuroprogression caused a worse subsequent course. A vicious cycle ensues with each episode causing more stress and making it even more difficult to cope and resulting in decreased neuroplasticity leading to more neuroprogression. Conversely, we tend to neglect the other side of bipolar disorder as a potential cause of a poor course with neuroprogression, that is, psychological well-being. Rather than examining the presence of illness, it could be illuminating to examine the absence of wellness. Why is this important? Carol Ryff has found a rigorous method to evaluate of psychological well-being – measuring six orthogonal aspects – autonomy, environmental mastery, positive interpersonal relationships, personal growth, purpose in life, and self-acceptance 6. In looking at this list, one might wonder why this would have any relevance at all to the course of bipolar disorder. But remarkably, Ryff and colleagues found that the lower the psychological well-being, the higher the allostatic load (and there is the connection), and the shorter the life lived 7. In other words, psychological well-being was related to mortality. It is important to note that psychological well-being is not life satisfaction or quality of life, but rather a separate dimension. Might low psychological well-being be yet another source that increases allostatic load and leads to neuroprogression? Another pathway to neuroprogression is obvious but contains a biological basis unfamiliar to most psychiatrists. The obvious pathway is the insidious combination of obesity and inactivity. Obesity, a common and unfortunate occurrence for people with bipolar disorder, causes a proliferation of white fat cells. White fat is an endocrine organ that promotes inflammation – a correlate of neuroprogression. The unfamiliar biological basis is that inactivity also causes a chain reaction that increases inflammation and compromises mitochondrial biogenesis through the PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) pathway and its associated activating cofactor PGC-1 alpha. It turns out that PGC-1 alpha is a master metabolic switch that not only is beneficial to multiple organ systems, but also promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, suppresses the destruction of muscle cells, and is postulated to indirectly promote the gene expression of BDNF. Exercise promotes while inactivity suppresses the gene expression of PGC-1 alpha 8. Obesity and inactivity synergistically worsens this suppression; healthy weight and exercise reverse it. The main point is that the stress path, the PPAR/PGC-1 alpha path, the low psychological well-being path, plus the other paths to neuroprogression are dynamic and hence makes the connection between bipolar disorder and neuroprogression complex. It is not surprising that Passos and colleagues found inconsistencies in the neuroprogression literature. Additionally, Passos and colleagues repeatedly call for longitudinal studies to assess course along with biomarkers, neuroimaging, and neurocognitive assessments and bemoan the lack of such studies. To conduct such studies requires persistence as well as funding, as these are difficult to do and require many people to successfully execute. Perhaps the time is right to consider how the field can collaborate and conduct such studies to address important hypotheses such as neuroprogression.",

Objectives To review differential diagnosis of auditory hallucinosis. Methods Pubmed search for terms: auditory and hallucinosis. Results Hallucinations should be evaluated according to: type, onset and evolution, association with physical and /or neurological symptoms, association with other hallucinations and/or other psychopathology, characteristics. Auditory hallucinations may present along a continuum from tinnitus, simple, verbal, musical. The Pubmed search retrieved articles pertaining to auditory hallucinations associated with: 1. Sensory deprivation; 2. Hearing loss, auditory Charles Bonnet syndrome; 3. Dementia, neurodegenerative disorders; 4. Brainstem lesions; 5. Other central nervous lesions: thalamus, temporal, other; 6. Epilepsy; 7. Tic disorders; 8. Alcohol use disorders; 9. Borderline personality disorder; 10. Others. Conclusions Patients presenting with auditory hallucinosis should be carefully evaluated to exclude non-psychiatric disorders. In some patients, such as the one who prompted the review, an identifiable cause may not yet be found. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) defines insomnia simply as \"difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep\". Other definitions exist, and there is no clear consensus in this matter. The core elements of insomnia are an inadequate quantity or quality of sleep, with both nocturnal and daytime consequences. Traditionally, insomnia has been subgrouped into sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintaining insomnia, and insomnia with early morning awakening; however, there is extensive overlap, and most insomniacs fit into more than one subgroup. Sleep disorders, particularly in the elderly, are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality, significant limitations in activities of daily living, and impaired quality of life. Aside from the obvious complications of daytime fatigue and somnolence, insomniacs have an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, increased use of over-the-counter medications and alcohol, and a higher incidence of accidents and unemployment. Chronic sleep loss has multisystem consequences and may represent a risk factor for obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. However, the brunt of negative effects of sleep deprivation is borne by the brain. Chronic insomnia independently predicts incident cognitive decline in older men, but it also has been suggested that some degree of apparent age-related cognitive decline may be due to treatable insomnia.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose of Review: This article provides a review of disturbances of sleep comorbid with common neurologic disorders. Recent Findings: A wide variety of neurologic disorders are frequently complicated by comorbid sleep disturbances. In many cases, a bidirectional relationship appears to occur between sleep function and the neurologic disease, such that treatment of comorbid sleep disturbances may improve the symptoms of the neurologic disease. Summary: Neurologic disorders are often associated with abnormalities of sleep. Sleep influences the severity of both epilepsy and headache, and treatment of comorbid sleep disorders may improve seizure and headache frequency. Alzheimer disease is characterized by circadian phase delay and poor nighttime sleep and is strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Parkinson disease is associated with several sleep disorders, including insomnia, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, daytime hypersomnia, and sleep-disordered breathing. Hypoventilation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neuromuscular disorders often presents initially with sleep problems, and treatment with noninvasive ventilation improves survival and quality of life.",

Seizures are of various types and can be difficult to manage. Developmental delay / intellectual disability (ID) is severe in nearly a half, moderate in a third, and mild in the remainder. Nearly a third never develop speech or language skills. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of NCBRS is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and the identification of a heterozygous SMARCA2 pathogenic variant by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizures under the care of a neurologist or epileptologist; occupational, physical, and/or speech therapy; routine management of refractive errors and hearing loss. Surveillance: At least yearly evaluation by a neurologist to assess for and/or manage seizures; yearly evaluation by a developmental pediatrician to assess developmental progress and therapeutic and educational interventions; regular follow up of ophthalmologic and/or audiologic abnormalities. Genetic counseling NCBRS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. All affected individuals reported to date have NCBRS as the result of a de novo SMARCA2 pathogenic variant. Although no affected sibs have been reported, the risk to sibs is presumed to be greater than in the general population because of the possibility of germline mosaicism in a parent. If the SMARCA2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for pregnancies at theoretic increased risk is possible.",

      "title": "Evaluation of Ataxia",
      "abstract": "Ataxia, defined as impaired coordination of movement and balance, is associated with dysfunction of the cerebellum or the sensory or motor pathways connecting to it. The causes of ataxia range from a transient parainfectious process to a progressive degenerative neurologic condition. The challenge for the pediatrician is to distinguish among the possible etiologies.The evaluation of ataxia begins with a thorough history and careful neurodevelopmental examination. The history must include the onset and duration of the symptom; family history of migraine or neurologic disease; recent infection, seizure, or head injury; and possible environmental exposure to heavy metals, gases, solvents, or medications. It is important to ask about other signs and symptoms, such as headache, vomiting, photophobia,vertigo, and altered mental status.Distinguishing whether a young child has age-appropriate clumsiness or is truly ataxic requires familiarity with the developmental milestones related to coordinated movements. Ataxia also must be distinguished from other disorders of the nervous system or of the muscles. The child should be examined in an upright position with attention to mental status, balance, presence of nystagmus, deep tendon reflexes, and muscle tone and strength. Muscle weakness from a myopathy or neuropathy may present with an altered gait and unstable balance, but it should be recognized on the basis of diminished muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes. Conversely, children who have spasticity may exhibit an unsteady,narrow-based gait, but they will demonstrate increased muscle tone and brisk reflexes. Movement disorders such as chorea and myoclonus, unlike ataxia,are evident even when the child is at rest.The examiner must look for evidence of increased intracranial pressure or infection by checking for abnormal vital signs, meningismus, and papilledema. With a patient is old enough to cooperate, the neurologic examination should evaluate cranial nerve function,heel-to-knee movement, finger-to-nose movement, tandem gait, rapid alternating movement, and speech. It is particularly important to listen for dysarthria,specifically the scanning speech pattern associated with cerebellar dysfunction. Dysfunction of the cerebellar vermis presents with truncal ataxia—imbalance in the sitting position and head titubation. Dysfunction of the cerebellar hemispheres presents with a gait that veers toward the involved side and dysmetria of the ipsilateral extremity. Attenuation of sensory input because of peripheral nerve or posterior column damage leads to a careful high-stepping gait and a positive Romberg sign. Children who have sensory ataxia have problems with fine finger movements rather than dysmetria.A typical presentation of acute ataxia is the sudden onset of a wide-based gait, with swerving and unsteadiness that is recognized easily by parent and physician. The most common causes are drug ingestion and postinfectious cerebellitis. The differential diagnosis includes head trauma, vascular events, brain tumor, hydrocephalus, the Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barrésyndrome (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and areflexia), labyrinthitis, seizure, and conversion reaction. Drugs associated with ataxia include phenytoin,carbamazepine, sedatives, hypnotics, and phencyclidine. Intoxication with alcohol, ethylene glycol, hydrocarbon fumes,lead, mercury, or thallium also may present with ataxia. A variety of pathogens can cause postinfectious cerebellitis, but it is observed most frequently after varicella.The evaluation of the child who has acute ataxia is based on the history and findings on physical examination, but it also should include a complete blood count, measurement of electrolytes,toxicologic screening of blood and urine, brain imaging, and lumbar puncture. If magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography demonstrates a mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or other intracranial abnormality, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation may be deferred. The presence of cells in the CSF may indicate infection, and elevated CSF protein levels are seen with Guillain-Barrésyndrome and multiple sclerosis. Ataxia, especially if accompanied by opsoclonus or myoclonus (“dancing eyes, dancing feet”), can be associated with neuroblastoma. If this diagnosis is suspected, examination of urine for vanillylmandelic acid/homovanillac acid(VMA/HVA) and imaging of the chest and abdomen are recommended.If the initial evaluation fails to establish a diagnosis, what appears to be acute ataxia actually may be the initial presentation of a more chronic process. Basilar migraine, seizure, and some rare metabolic disorders (Hartnup disease,maple syrup urine disease, pyruvate decarboxylase deficiency) may manifest with acute intermittent episodes of ataxia. Evaluation again is based on the history, but it may include brain imaging, electroencephalography, and electromyography. If metabolic disease is suspected, evaluation of amino acids,acid/base balance, lactate, pyruvate,ammonia, and ketones may be helpful.The slow evolution of ataxia in a previously healthy child warrants rapid evaluation. The most common causes of progressive ataxia are brain tumors(medulloblastoma, cerebellar astrocytoma,brain stem glioma, ependymoma)and degenerative spinocerebellar diseases, some of which present in infancy and others of which are delayed in onset until adulthood. Friedreich ataxia,an autosomal recessive disorder linked to a defect on chromosome 9, presents in the first decade of life with ataxia,pes cavus, scoliosis, and areflexia. Ataxia telangiectasia, also autosomal recessive, is marked by an abnormality on the long arm of chromosome 11 and is characterized by progressive truncal ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias,and recurrent infections of the sinuses and lungs. If magnetic resonance imaging of a child who has progressive ataxia fails to disclose an intracranial mass, referral for a detailed metabolic and genetic evaluation is warranted.In summary, ataxia may represent a benign, transient condition or a progressive, devastating neurologic disorder. As is usually true, a careful history and physical examination, followed by a focused radiologic and laboratory assessment, most often will lead to the proper diagnosis and intervention.As a disorder of coordination that depends on sensory,proprioceptive, motor, and integrative neural activities, ataxia can reflect dysfunction at virtually any level of the nervous system, not just the cerebellum. It also can be difficult to distinguish between ataxia and weakness when a child presents with, for example, an abnormal gait, and the differential diagnosis,although related, is not the same. Ataxia is particularly frightening because it represents a loss of physical control for the patient, and it poses some very nasty possibilities for the pediatrician. Clinical medicine is not easy, but it is less difficult if we go back to the basics,with a careful history and physical examination. It’s amazing how often we can get to the answer without magnetic resonance imaging.",

      "abstract": "Encephalopathy related to Status Epilepticus during slow Sleep (ESES) is an age-dependent phenomenon, with usual spontaneous resolution during teenage years. However, cognitive outcome is often more disappointing, with permanent cognitive deficits in the large majority of children seen in later life. Presuming this to be an epileptic encephalopathy, current treatment practices are almost exclusively guided by the effect of the AEDs used on the degree of EEG abnormality in sleep. However, the major goal of therapy in ESES syndrome should in fact be to prevent or reduce associated cognitive and neurodevelopmental deficits. Whether or not the EEG pattern of ESES should be completely suppressed to improve cognition is unknown. Discussions on both diagnostic assessment and outcome of cognitive impairment and behavioral disorders should systematically take into account the complexity of the disorder; not only in terms of the evolution or fluctuations of the EEG patterns but also in relation to the underlying etiologies (at least lesional versus non-lesional) and age at diagnosis. We present a common basic assessment protocol, including the minimum technical requirements for polygraphic recording, and a treatment practice protocol that could both be applied in all centres dealing with this rare form of epilepsy. Such an approach would also allow a comprehensive collection of data prospectively, for a better understanding of the natural evolution of the disorder and an evidence-based evaluation of our practices.",

Bulbar dysfunction as evident by drooling, dysarthria, swallowing difficulties, and palatal-glossalpharyngeal weakness has been reported in conjunction with epilepsy. This is non-progressive and is correlated in its severity with the frequency of seizures. Accompanying EEG discharges are often localized to rolandic areas that cortically represent oral movements and salivation. We report a 6-year-old male and a 6 1/2-year-old female with progressive bulbar dysfunction resulting from epilepsy. Ictal EEGs in patient 1 did not confirm a diagnosis of epilepsy. With no evidence of a cortical or brainstem focus from EEG or MRI, it is very difficult to explain the mechanism of bulbar dysfunction. The complete restoration of bulbar function after treatment with antiepileptic drugs demonstrates the need to consider epilepsy in similar clinical situations.",

      "title": "Early identification and intervention for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

The prevalence of LD in the general population has been found to be 2–10% and reading disorders are the most frequent subtype. Epilepsy is one of the commonest neurological disorders in childhood with an estimated prevalence in 4–5/1,000. Epilepsy is considered to be idiopathic or cryptogenic in approximately two‐thirds of cases. LD are more common in people with epilepsy than in the general population: about 25% of patients with epilepsy are said to have LD. Various psychosocial, medication‐related, and epilepsy‐related factors may be associated with LD in epilepsy. LD can be either permanent or state‐dependent. Permanent LD are caused by a brain lesion and/or a stable brain dysfunction. In contrast, state‐dependent LD are potentially reversible and treatable; they are caused by epilepsy‐related factors. If allowed to persist for a long period, a state‐dependent LD may become permanent.",

Among these, diabetic neuropathy is particularly prevalent and contributes to substantial neuromuscular impairments in both types 1 and 2 diabetes. This condition leads to structural damage affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems, resulting in a significant decline in sensorimotor functions. Alongside neuropathy, diabetic myopathy also contributes to muscle impairment and reduced motor performance, intensifying the neuromuscular decline. Diabetic neuropathy typically implicates neurogenic muscle atrophy, motoneuron loss and clustering of muscle fibres as a result of aberrant denervation-reinervation processes. These complications are associated with compromised neuromuscular junctions, where alterations occur in pre-synaptic vesicles, mitochondrial content and post-synaptic signalling. Neural damage is intensified by chronic hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress, exacerbating vascular dysfunction and reducing oxygen delivery. These complications imply a severe decline in neuromuscular performance, evidenced by reductions in maximal force and power output, rate of force development and muscle endurance. Furthermore, diabetes-related complications are compounded by age-related degenerative changes in long-term patients. Aerobic and resistance training offer promising approaches for managing blood glucose levels and neuromuscular function. Aerobic exercise promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and angiogenesis, supporting metabolic and cardiovascular health. Resistance training primarily enhances neural plasticity, muscle strength and hypertrophy, which are crucial factors for mitigating sarcopenia and preserving functional independence. This topical review examines current evidence on the physiological mechanisms underlying diabetic neuropathy and the potential impact of physical activity in counteracting this decline.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases progress over three distinct stages: (1) the preclinical stage, at which individuals can be placed on a continuum ranging from completely asymptomatic to a very subtle decline; (2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is the symptomatic predementia stage of dementia, characterized by impairment in memory or other domains of cognition; and (3) dementia itself. Dementia is a common condition that mainly occurs in older people. It is characterized by a significant decline of cognitive functioning severe enough to impact activities of daily living and social functioning. The loss of cognitive functioning in dementia may affect long-term and short-term memory, attention, visual perception, executive functions, motor planning and execution, problem-solving, and language. Dementia can be caused by a wide range of pathological entities, among which Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common. Other dementia types include vascular dementia (VaD), dementia in atypical parkinsonian syndromes such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). While these are commonly associated with an impairment of episodic memory, the major forms of dementia are also characterized by deficits of language affecting comprehension and production abilities of words and sentences. Clinical linguistic profiles usually associated with common forms of dementia have been described, some more detailed than others. Neurolinguistic studies also went further than the mere description of symptoms and identified the functional localization of impaired and preserved processing components of the linguistic processing system in dementias. The initial evaluation is the first significant step toward the clinical management of dementia and is based on consensual diagnostic criteria. In some dementia syndromes, such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA), the characterization of language deficits is of major importance for the differential diagnosis of dementia. This article focuses on bibliographic resources related to language and communication disorders in mild cognitive disorders as well as in the most frequent primary progressive syndromes of dementia.",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Diabetic neuropathy (DN) refers to symptoms and signs of neuropathy in a patient with diabetes in whom other causes of neuropathy have been excluded. Distal symmetrical neuropathy is the commonest accounting for 75% DN. Asymmetrical neuropathies may involve cranial nerves, thoracic or limb nerves; are of acute onset resulting from ischaemic infarction of vasa nervosa. Asymmetric neuropathies in diabetic patients should be investigated for entrapment neuropathy. Diabetic amyotrophy, initially considered to result from metabolic changes, and later ischaemia, is now attributed to immunological changes. For diagnosis of DN, symptoms, signs, quantitative sensory testing, nerve conduction study, and autonomic testing are used; and two of these five are recommended for clinical diagnosis. Management of DN includes control of hyperglycaemia, other cardiovascular risk factors; α lipoic acid and L carnitine. For neuropathic pain, analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants are recommended. The treatment of autonomic neuropathy is symptomatic.",

The many functions of sleep are still being characterized, and it is clear that sleep is not a passive state but a dynamic condition during which memories are consolidated, restorative hormones are released, and neuronal excitability is modulated.1 Many clinical syndromes of sleep are intertwined with neurologic disorders. The REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with parkinsonian syndromes and other neurodegenerative disorders. Restless legs syndrome occurs with myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nThe syndrome of sleep apnea interacts with neurologic disorders in several ways. 1) Many patients with neurologic disorders have coexisting sleep apnea simply because obstructive sleep apnea is so common.

Three main clinicopathological syndromes have been described‐movement disorder, autonomic failure, and dementia. Parkinsonism is the most common presentation of LB disease developing in middle life. In older patients, a mixture of cognitive, autonomic, and motor dysfunction is more common. Dementia with LB (DLB) is a relatively recently described clinicopathological syndrome that accounts for up to 20% of all cases of dementia in old age.

We present an unusual case which presented with unilateral abducens nerve palsy. Case presentation : A 51 year old female patient presented with a history of difficulty in walking and double vision for 1 week which started 2 weeks following an episode of acute gastroenteritis. She didn’t have any bladder bowel incontinence or difficulty in breathing. On examination there was left side abducens nerve palsy and bilateral significant dysmetria. Upper limb and lower limb power was 4/5 with global areflexia. There was no fatigability or sensory deficit. Higher cortical functions were intact with Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15. Brain stem cerebro vascular accident, alcohol, toxin or drug mediated disease, myasthenia gravis, Bickerstaff encephalitis and Miller-Fisher syndrome were considered as possible differential diagnosis. There was no history of alcohol consumption or any exposure to drugs or toxins. Her Non contrast brain and MRI brain were normal. Nerve conduction study showed asymmetrical sensory motor and F wave abnormalities consistent with a Guillen-Barre Sydrome variant. Cerebro Spinal Fluid analysis showed albumino-cytological dissociation. These findings suggested the diagnosis of Miller-Fisher Syndrome. She was started on plasmaphareis. Her vital parameters, vital capacity and neurological deficit were closely monitored. With 5 cycles of plasmapharesis she made a complete neurological recovery and she was discharged on 16th day of admission. Conclusion: Miller Fisher Syndrome can present as unilateral abducens nerve palsy and early diagnosis and treatment leads to excellent functional outcome.",

Primary and secondary insomnia, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RDB), central sleep apnea, restless legs, and nocturnal akinesia are common sleep disturbances in PD. Prodromal presence of RBD is associated with a more severe motor and non-motor PD subtype implying a significant disease-modifying effect of this parasomnia. Other disease-modifying mechanisms of sleep disturbances in PD include impaired glymphatic clearance, endoplasmic reticulum stress, nocturnal brain deoxygenation and inflammatory processes among others. Impairments of neural circuit switching and imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations are likely responsible for episodic sleep disturbances, in particular RBD. As neural circuits may predict patterns of α-synuclein propagation in the nervous system, impairments of such circuits are of high relevance for PD pathophysiology. Future research is needed to determine whether appropriate treatment for disturbed sleep might slow progression of PD.",

      "abstract": "Eye movement abnormalities can provide valuable diagnostic insights across various neurodegenerative disorders. This review summarizes the characteristic oculomotor findings in different neurodegenerative conditions, focusing on cognitive disorders and parkinsonian syndromes. The neural control of eye movements involves complex networks across multiple cortical regions, including the frontal eye field, supplementary eye field, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, functioning in coordination with subcortical structures. In Alzheimer disease, patients exhibit impaired fixation with large saccadic intrusions, prolonged saccadic latency, and increased antisaccade errors, which correlate with cognitive decline. Frontotemporal dementia shows variant-specific patterns of oculomotor dysfunction, with behavioral variant particularly affecting antisaccade performance while maintaining the ability to self-correct errors. In parkinsonian syndromes, distinctive eye movement abnormalities aid in differential diagnosis. Idiopathic Parkinson disease typically presents with hypometric saccades and increased saccadic intrusions during fixation, which correlate with disease severity. Progressive supranuclear palsy characteristically shows early vertical saccade abnormalities and frequent macro–square-wave jerks. Multiple system atrophy demonstrates various central nystagmus patterns and perverted head-shaking nystagmus, while corticobasal degeneration presents with saccadic apraxia and asymmetric oculomotor abnormalities. While eye movement abnormalities can be nonspecific and overlap between conditions, careful evaluation of oculomotor function can provide important diagnostic clues, particularly for differentiating parkinsonian syndromes. Understanding these distinct patterns of oculomotor abnormalities provides critical insights into the underlying pathophysiology and serves as a valuable tool for differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders.",

These criteria allow to make the diagnosis of \"probable\" or \"possible\" dementia associated with DLBD. With certainty this form of dementia can only be diagnosed by neuropathological examination which reveals diffuse cortical Lewy bodies. At present there is no agreement whether DLBD is a variant of Alzheimer's disease or a separate nosological entity--the second commonest cause of dementia. The main clinical feature of DLBD is coexistence of dementia and symptoms of parkinsonian syndrome. The other important feature which differentiates between DLBD and other forms of dementia is a very considerable early fluctuation of cognitive state. Psychotic symptoms in the course of DLBD--visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions and depression--are common. At present treatment of DLBD is unknown. Treatment of psychotic symptoms is difficult because of the presence of parkinsonism.",

      "abstract": "Apraxia is a term used to denote a wide spectrum of higher order motor disorders that result from acquired brain disease affecting the performance of skilled and/or learned movements with or without preservation of the ability to perform the same movement outside the clinical setting in the appropriate situation or environment. The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "abstract": "To describe the current state of the art about the main cognitive deficits that appear in patients affected with narcolepsy with cataplexy (NT1).The majority of the studies have found that the most impaired cognitive functions are attention (especially maintenance of attention or sustained attention), speed of information processing and executive functions (in particular, verbal fluency and resistance to the stimuli interference). These data indicate the difficulty to use the available cognitive resources of the patient. These alterations are similar to those present in other hypersomnias, although they might differ in intensity. Moreover, most of the studies emphasize a high prevalence of different depressive and anxious disorders. It has been suggested that predisposition to anxiety could be part of the characteristic phenotype of these patients. Anxiety could act either as a trigger for the disease or a consequence of the disease.Cognitive deficits in patients with NT1 appear in long lasting and/or monotonous tasks and in high cognitive demanding tasks. The presence of depressive symptomatology, together with excessive daytime sleepiness in these patients could affect their performance in neuropsychological test, and it might be related to their subjective perception of the cognitive deficits.Alteraciones neuropsicologicas en la narcolepsia con cataplejia: una revision.Objetivo. Describir el estado actual de conocimiento sobre los principales deficits cognitivos que presentan los pacientes con narcolepsia con cataplejia o narcolepsia de tipo 1. Desarrollo. La mayoria de los estudios ha encontrado que las funciones cognitivas mas afectadas son la atencion (especialmente el mantenimiento de la atencion o atencion sostenida), la velocidad de procesamiento de la informacion y las funciones ejecutivas (en particular, la fluidez verbal y la resistencia a la interferencia de estimulos). Estos datos indican una dificultad para utilizar los recursos cognitivos de los que dispone el sujeto. Estas alteraciones son similares a las presentes en otras hipersomnias, aunque difieren en la intensidad. Por otra parte, la mayoria de los estudios destaca una elevada prevalencia de diferentes trastornos depresivos y ansiosos. Se ha sugerido que la predisposicion a la ansiedad forma parte del fenotipo caracteristico de estos pacientes. La ansiedad podria actuar como un factor desencadenante de la enfermedad y ser asimismo una consecuencia de la enfermedad. Conclusiones. Los deficits cognitivos en los pacientes con narcolepsia de tipo 1 se manifiestan en tareas de larga duracion o monotonas y en tareas con alta demanda cognitiva, principalmente en tareas de atencion sostenida. La presencia de sintomatologia depresiva en estos pacientes, junto con la excesiva somnolencia diurna, parecen afectar a su rendimiento en las pruebas neuropsicologicas, y estar estrechamente relacionadas con la apreciacion subjetiva de dificultades cognitivas.",

      "title": "Neurological Soft Signs in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neurological soft signs (NSS) are minor motor and sensory changes that are frequently found in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including subjects with an increased liability to them, but can also be observed in bipolar disorder and dementia. In schizophrenia, high NSS-scores, which typically mark acute psychotic states, decrease in the course of illness with remission of acute symptoms. This process continues in patients with a favorable course but does not lead to a complete “normalization” of NSS, which remain in the range typical for subjects with an increased liability. As a transdiagnostic phenomenon, NSS are associated with similar symptoms and neurocognitive deficits across the respective disorders, such as negative symptoms, apathy or executive and declarative memory dysfunction. Neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia identified frontal cortices, including pre- and postcentral gyrus, inferior and middle frontal gyrus, and premotor area, alongside cerebellum, caudate, and thalamus as important sites for NSS. NSS can be used for early recognition and clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia and have the potential to facilitate our understanding of the cerebral mechanisms involved in its pathophysiology.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "abstract": "Critically ill patients with a primary neurological injury or illness pose unique challenges for pain, agitation, and delirium management in intensive care units (ICUs). Detection and monitoring can be limited by contextual level of consciousness (LOC) alterations, cognition, expression, or language deficits. Recent data suggest that existing pain assessment tools may not be applicable to all neurocritically ill patients, especially in those with LOC alterations and atypical pain-associated behaviors. Targeted sedation goals may be neurologically disease specific; for instance, intracranial pressure (ICP) targets will supersede sedation titration by other criteria. Technology such as bispectral index (BIS) may be beneficial in avoiding excessive medication administration in deeply sedated neurologically injured ICU patients. Given the wide variety of pathology in the neurocritically ill patients, it is unclear if delirium can be diagnosed and unequivocally differentiated from symptoms of the underlying neurological pathology. However, delirium symptoms may herald life-threatening primary insult progression or result from a new secondary neurological injury and should be monitored. Patients with neurological injury or illness are often excluded from ICU studies addressing pain, sedation, and delirium, but this need not be the case. We review what is understood in this area based on current evidence.",

      "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and they represent a major source of disease burden. Several non-motor manifestations, such as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, olfactory loss, gastrointestinal abnormalities, visual alterations, cognitive and mood disorders, are known to precede the onset of motor signs. Nonetheless, the mechanisms mediating these alterations are poorly understood and probably involve several neurotransmitter systems. The dysregulation of GABAergic system has received little attention in PD, although the spectrum of non-motor symptoms might be linked to this pathway. This Mini Review aims to provide up-to-date information about the involvement of the GABAergic system for explaining non-motor manifestations in early stages of PD. Therefore, special attention is paid to the clinical data derived from patients with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder or drug-naïve patients with PD, as they represent prodromal and early stages of the disease, respectively. This, in combination with animal studies, might help us to understand how the disturbance of the GABAergic system is related to non-motor manifestations of PD.",

      "abstract": "Various grades of cognitive impairment generally occur in older adults over the age of 55, where cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and/or hypertension, coronary artery disease, or cerebrovascular accidents are also common. Cognitive impairment occurs in various forms, from mild or amnesia such as forgetting today's date to more ominous and progressive forms, such as frank dementia. Over 5 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, most of whom live in low- and middle-income countries. It has been envisaged from the beginning that dementia or cognitive impairment has neurodegenerative origins. However, recent studies have indicated that dementia may have a mixed origin or may be preceded by vascular insult and then neurodegenerative pathology. From a pathophysiological standpoint, one of the puzzling questions in the field of cognitive impairment and comorbidities is that it is not clear whether cardiovascular comorbidity or cognitive impairment comes first. Cognitive impairment negatively affects mobility and fitness and this can potentially contribute to development of hypertension or/and diabetes. The present review examines this perplexing situation and tries to anser whether the comorbid conditions are innocent bystanders to cognitive impairment or they play greater causative roles. The rationale of the review is that it is possible to address these cardiovascular risk factors for dementia prevention and hence it summarizes the evidence related to cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive impairment.",

      "title": "Size matters?",
      "abstract": "With the increasing longevity of ‘westernized’ populations, cognitive decline and associated dementia has become a problem of growing scale and complexity. Affected individuals suffer impaired quality of life; friends, relatives and carers suffer years of distress and exhaustion; and health services struggle to cope with the resource implications. Alzheimer's disease and multiinfarct disease are the two commonest forms, although there is considerable overlap and mixed patterns are not infrequent. Both these forms are associated with hypertension. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLBs) is the second commonest degenerative form and is less clearly associated with hypertension. In the case of vascular dementia (VaD), hypertension is an important, if not dominant, predisposing factor. Large cortical infarcts are known to affect speech, comprehension, visiospatial skills and higher executive function. In these patients, cognitive impairment may often be overshadowed by the major residual neurological deficits of aphasia, apraxia and sensorimotor impairment and may even go unrecognized or underestimated. Small vessel disease– often resulting in subcortical lacunes– may result in less dramatic neurological deficits but when recurrent may result in extensive white matter change and severe progressive cognitive impairment. ‘Silent’ subcortical brain ischaemia may also accrue in the periventricular white matter, with or without lacunar disease, and is particularly associated with lipohyalinosis of small penetrating arteries in elderly hypertensive patients. None of these patterns is mutually exclusive. Two interesting subsets of VaD are characterized by distinctive histopathology. In cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), amyloid accumulates in cerebral arterioles and predisposes to multiple haemorrhages, infarctions, ischaemic white matter damage and cognitive impairment [1]. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADISIL) produces a syndrome of migraine, extensive lacunar infarction and white matter ischaemia, occurring in a strong familial pattern [2]. From all these and other observations, it is increasingly clear that dementia or cognitive decline is a very complex process with powerful genetic, vascular and degenerative elements. Not only is there a wide spectrum of underlying disorder, but it also seems apparent that clinical features may vary between one pattern of dementia and another. Memory loss is a prominent early feature of Alzheimer's disease, for example, whereas this may appear as a later feature of patients with VaD. In general, the volume of damaged brain tissue is linked to the development of dementia [3]. However, the regional distribution of brain disorder is also critical. In patients developing dementia from cortical strokes, the resulting clinical picture will be strongly influenced by the particular brain region affected; frontal lobe lesions commonly being associated with apathy, loss of executive function and personality change, left temporoparietal lobe lesions with aphasia, acalculia and loss of sense of direction, and right parietal lobe lesions with visiospatial apraxia, anosognosia, etc. Subcortical syndromes also reflect the underlying damaged neural pathways, and may include Parkinsonian features, gait disturbance and emotional lability. Establishing links between hypertension and cognitive impairment has been more difficult than establishing links with stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). Cognitive impairment is a semiquantitative trait rather than a discrete variable and it has taken some time to establish a widely recognized valid measurement tool. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most widely used scale and is reasonably robust and standardized, and may be enhanced by addition of criteria such as the Hachinski score [4] or DSM-IV [5,6] to help distinguish VaD from Alzheimer's disease. As dementia progresses, one of the common clinical features is apathy for food and resultant weight loss, which may be accompanied by a significant fall in blood pressure (BP). Some forms of dementia may be accompanied by autonomic dysfunction and resultant BP changes. The net effect is that the BP at the time of diagnosis may be much lower than in the earlier years of subclinical progression of cognitive decline [7]. Cross-sectional data on BP may thus fail to reflect the true association with the evolution of the disease process. Furthermore, ‘spot’ measurements of BP suffer from sampling errors– this may be one area in which ambulatory BP measurements may offer some advantages. A number of studies have indeed reported that midlife vascular risk factors, including BP, may be associated with dementia later in life [8,9], and that markers of vascular stiffness may antedate cognitive decline [10,11]. Lowering BP in patients with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (using indapamide and perindopril) reduces the risk of subsequent stroke [12]. An underestimated benefit of such treatment is the concomitant reduction in cognitive decline– principally mediated by prevention of recurrent strokes [13]. Even before this evidence emerged, it had been suggested that BP reduction in patients with isolated systolic hypertension (using nitrendipine as first line) also reduced the incidence of dementia and cognitive decline [14]. In this case, the main effect seemed to be prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Prevention of Alzheimer's disease had not been observed in either the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) study [15] in a similar group of patients treated with diuretic as first line, or in the Medical Research Council (MRC) elderly hypertension trial [16] using atenolol or thiazide as first line therapy, raising the possibility that a treatment-specific effect may have accounted for the difference. A prespecified outcome analysis of the Study on COgnition and Prognosis in the Elderly (SCOPE) trial [17], using candesartan as first line therapy, did not show a difference in cognitive function compared with placebo, though a post-hoc analysis in patients with mildly impaired MMSE scores at baseline suggested a modest benefit [18]. Recently, the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) [19] in hypertensive patients over the age of 80 years was stopped early because of a highly significant benefit of active medication (indapamide and perindopril versus placebo) on stroke. All cause mortality and other major cardiovascular endpoints were also substantially reduced. The results of cognitive function studies in this trial are awaited with interest. Clearly, the implications of these observations are very considerable in respect of both primary and secondary prevention of cognitive decline. Is BP reduction really beneficial? If so, is the mechanism related purely to prevention of recurrent stroke? Is there a differential drug effect on cognition that might relate to the mode of action of the antihypertensive drug? That is not too fanciful, given recent evidence suggesting that for a given reduction in BP, antihypertensives, alone or in combination, may have differential effects not just on major outcomes but also on glucose tolerance [20], regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) [21], development of new onset atrial fibrillation [22] and improvement in proteinuria [23]. This is clearly an important area for future research, though outcome studies are difficult to perform because of the magnitude of any effect, the lack of precision and predictive power of surrogate measures and the need for long-term follow-up. Mechanistic studies exploring the association between BP, cognitive function and neuropathology are therefore of considerable interest. In this month's issue, Nagai et al. [24] report that ambulatory BP is an independent determinant of brain atrophy and cognitive function in elderly hypertensives. Their main conclusion is that ‘nondippers’ appear to have smaller brain volumes and lower cognitive function scores. In multiple linear regression analysis, mean nighttime systolic blood pressure (SBP) bore the closest (negative) association with total brain volume and MMSE score. Their study had four main elements; patients, ambulatory BP measurement, cognitive assessment and neuroimaging, and each merits some scrutiny. They studied 55 untreated hypertensive patients over the age of 70 years. However, the mean clinic BP was 148/82 mmHg so that these were mainly patients with mild systolic hypertension. Their method of ambulatory BP recording (TM-2421 or TM-2425) is reasonably robust and well validated. Measurement was undertaken only once, and this suffers from limited reproducibility, including assessment of the dipping pattern [25]. The authors define ‘sleep’ as the time between going to bed and waking up. Not everyone sleeps undisturbed [26] and it is possible that patients with evolving cognitive impairment may have disturbed sleep pattern as an early feature, which might then lead to higher night-time pressure. The study did not investigate sleep patterns and it would be prudent to refer to ‘overnight’ rather than ‘sleep’ BP. Their method of ascertaining cognitive function– MMSE [5] is a validated and internationally recognized standard, though it may be more valuable in assessing change over time rather than as a cross-sectional tool. Sixteen of their patients had an MMSE of less than 25, and some of these may have had mild dementia, though none fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for this. Their method of assessing brain atrophy was by MRI using a 1.5 T scanner and T1-weighted spoiled gradient recalled-echo (SPGR) images for the whole brain in the coronal plane to obtain total brain mass [27]. Although the technique is well established and was conducted by a single experienced observer with good internal reproducibility, the method is rather old and gives no information about brain substructures, grey and white matter differentiation or quantification of lacunar disease. Voxel-based morphometry [28] might be a more informative method. Recent studies have shown not only the effects of normal ageing [29] but also patterns of atrophy in Alzheimer's disease [30], and a distinct pattern of focal atrophy in DLBs that can be distinguished from Alzheimer's disease [31]. The proportion of the intracranial cavity occupied by the brain and volume of white matter hyperintensities may independently predict progression of cognitive decline [32]. What's done is done. As it stands the paper (admittedly derived from a small cohort) adds to the literature linking hypertension with cognitive impairment. Mean nighttime SBP has previously been shown to be linked more strongly with major cardiovascular outcomes than 24 h or daytime means or clinic BP [33]. Is this a general phenomenon that extends to brain volume or the consequence of some linked mechanism? This cross-sectional study does not exclude the possibility that some influence in earlier life– for example intrauterine growth retardation– might predispose to both hypertension and smaller brain volume. The brain imaging data are of interest, though in a limited way, and more sophisticated imaging modalities need to be explored. Albert Einstein died in 1955 at the age of 76 years of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. I am unaware if he was hypertensive, though it seems very probable. He was mentally alert to his final day. His brain was removed at autopsy, measured, fixed and examined in detail. No abnormality was found, but a subsequent detailed review [34] of the autopsy material made some interesting observations suggesting a unique morphology of his left inferior parietal lobule, with a distinctive variation in the Sylvian fissure and supramarginal gyrus. Total brain volume was not measured but his overall brain weight was no different from normal. Einstein embraced the medical technology of his day, volunteering for electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in the interests of neurological research. One can imagine his enthusiasm for modern neuroimaging; what he would have made of a mini-mental examination is another story.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep is a complex behavioural state, the ultimate functions of which remain poorly understood. It becomes more fragmented as we age, with more night‐time awakenings and greater tendency for daytime sleep. The magnitude of disordered sleep among individuals affected by dementia has been clearly demonstrated, and disturbed sleep is a major clinical problem in dementia. Comorbid insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, such A lzheimer's disease and other dementing disorders. How and when sleep problems manifest themselves can depend on the type of dementia involved as well as the stage of the dementia. However, differences in sleep pattern presentation show more variation during the initial stages of dementias than they do during the later stages. Effective, pragmatic interventions are largely anecdotal and untested.",

Dysregulation of the following endocrine systems commonly affects behavior: the adrenocorticoid system, the thyroid system, the parathyroid system, the pancreas and regulation of glucose, and the reproductive system. Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common across the spectrum of endocrine disorders and more severe cases may include psychotic features. Clinicians are often faced with the challenge of identifying an underlying endocrine etiology for behavioral changes based on relatively nonspecific symptoms. A general understanding of the signs and symptoms associated with elevated or decreased hormone levels can assist in the differential diagnosis and ultimately increase the likelihood that a patient receives appropriate treatment. Accurate diagnosis can be especially critical in acute behavioral emergencies.",

      "abstract": "Cerebral visual disorders include a range of common and rare deficits. They can be divided into effects on low-, intermediate-, and high-level forms of visual processing. Low-level deficits are various forms of homonymous hemifield scotomata, which affect all types of vision within their borders. Intermediate-level deficits refer to impairments of colour or motion perception, which affect either one hemifield or the entire field when lesions are bilateral. High-level deficits are divided into those of the ventral (occipitotemporal) or dorsal (occipitoparietal) stream. Occipitotemporal lesions affect various aspects of object recognition, ranging from general visual agnosia to selective agnosias, such as prosopagnosia or topographagnosia from right or bilateral lesions, and pure alexia from left-sided lesions. Occipitoparietal lesions cause the various components of Bálint syndrome, namely, simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, and ocular motor apraxia. They can also cause other impairments of visuospatial or visuotemporal processing, such as astereopsis and sequence-agnosia. Because of anatomic proximity, certain deficits cluster together to form a number of cerebral visual syndromes. Treatment of these disorders remains challenging, with frequent reliance on strategic substitutions rather than restorative approaches.",

      "title": "What causes mental dysfunction in Parkinson's disease?",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently associated with mental dysfunction. Domain-specific cognitive deficits are ubiquitous, and although they may not be clinically apparent in all patients, they are demonstrable by neuropsychological testing. Dementia is less frequent but is present significantly more in PD patients than in controls, with a cumulative prevalence rate up to 40% and up to six-fold increased incidence. Cognitive impairment mainly involves executive and visuospatial functions; memory is secondarily impaired with relatively preserved recognition. Qualitatively, the neuropsychological profile of dementia encompasses the same type of deficits found in nondemented PD patients. The dementia seen in PD, therefore, can be described as a dysexecutive syndrome combined with visuospatial dysfunction and behavioural symptoms. Dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic, and cholinergic deficits have all been described as the underlying neurochemical impairment, but the strongest evidence exists for a cholinergic dysfunction. Involvement of brainstem nuclei, limbic structures, and cerebral cortex have been suggested as the site, and Lewy body (LB) degeneration and Alzheimer-type changes as the type of pathology underlying the mental dysfunction in PD. Although there is still some controversy as to the site and type of pathology, recent evidence suggests that LB-type degeneration in limbic structures and cerebral cortex, with consequent synaptic and cell loss, is the main pathological state associated with dementia in PD. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society",

Despite apparently successful hemodialysis, these patients develop a wide spectrum of neurological abnormalities. Of these, sudden onset of hesitant, nonfluent speech is the most characteristic and usually the earliest sign. Both dysphasic and dysarthric elements are found, though the former predominate. Myoclonus, dementia, seizures, and gait difficulty are also seen in the majority of these patients. EEGs are more abnormal than would be expected for the clinical severity, with some type of high‐voltage spike‐wave pattern intermixed with abundant slow activity. The combination of clinical and EEG features in the appropriate setting is virtually diagnostic. Transient episodes with variable periods of complete or partial remission have been recognized. Neuropathological changes are surprisingly mild and nonspecific. The cause is uncertain; current speculation focuses on aluminum as the offending neurotoxin. Treatment remains unsatisfactory.",

The clinical features of delirium predominantly involve subacute changes in cognition, awareness, and activity levels, behavioral disturbance, clouding consciousness, and sleep-wake cycle changes. In contrast, epilepsy involves the acute interruption of brain function, often with convulsive activity, falls, and injury. States that may share the clinical features of both, such as nonconvulsive epileptic states, are also important: the cause of brain derangement is one of excessive and abnormal electrical brain activity. In such conditions, the clinical manifestations may resemble states of delirium and confusion, and the absence of convulsive clinical activity is significant. Electroencephalography remains the diagnostic test of choice: it is essential for differentiating these two conditions, enabling the distinctly different treatments and epilepsy. Ongoing research and investigation are essential to better understand the abnormal brat mechanisms underlying delirium, and to develop better tools for objective diagnosis.",

Symptoms of nightblindness and of dayblindness with photoaversion, nystagmus, poor vision in infants or unclear visual field defects are meaningful indications for ERG testing. We use standardized (ISCEV) full-field single flash ERGs to evaluate the function of the rod- and of the cone-system. In infants, general anesthesia is useful to combine an abbreviated ERG protocol with ophthalmoscopy and fundus photography. ERG testing facilitates to distinguish between functional deficits in the rod- and cone-system, between congenital-stationary retinal dysfunction and progressive retinal heredo-degenerations. Frequently a functional deficit of the retina without ophthalmoscopic changes can be assessed. These entities include achromatopsia, congenital stationary night blindness, early stages of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or progressive cone dystrophy, as well as toxic retinal changes. Congenital amaurosis Leber (LCA), infantile RP, Usher's syndrome and retinal involvement in other neuropediatric or metabolic syndromes can be diagnosed or excluded by ERG recording early-on.

Psychiatric symptoms often represent the clinical onset of such disorders, thus potentially leading to misdiagnosis, delay in treatment, and a worse outcome. In this review, psychiatric symptoms observed along the course of several neurological diseases, namely Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis, are discussed, as well as the involved brain circuits and molecular/synaptic alterations. Special attention has been paid to the emerging role of fluid biomarkers in early detection of these neurodegenerative diseases. The frequent occurrence of psychiatric symptoms in neurological diseases, even as the first clinical manifestations, should prompt neurologists and psychiatrists to share a common clinico-biological background and a coordinated diagnostic approach.",

Chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy is appropriately treated with long-term immunosuppression and steroid-sparing agents. Optical coherence tomography and angiography have become two of the most important imaging modalities in neuro-ophthalmology. Optic neuritis is one of the most common causes of subacute unilateral visual loss in young adults. Ophthalmic involvement is a result of direct fungal infiltration or ischaemic infarction and this leads to acute ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, periorbital oedema and blindness from central retinal artery occlusion or an optic neuropathy. Supranuclear eye movement abnormalities result when the cerebral, cerebellar and brainstem afferent inputs to the ocular motor nuclei are disrupted.",

The associated NMSs primarily include neuropsychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, sleep‐wake disorders, pain, fatigue, and hyposmia. These NMSs can occur at any stage of PD, especially before the onset of motor symptoms, and may affect a patient's quality of life more than motor symptoms. Although PD is most commonly diagnosed in people over 65 years, some patients exhibit symptom onset before the age of 50, which is clinically known as early‐onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD). The high heterogeneity and incidence of EOPD‐associated NMSs can lead to the misdiagnosis of EOPD as other neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the research progress related to NMSs in patients with EOPD, focusing on neuropsychiatric disorders, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, and sensory impairment, and outline the association of NMSs with different genotypic alterations, with the aim of providing assistance in the clinical management of patients.",

The most important disturbances in locomotion include ataxia, falling down and inability to get up. Diagnostic procedures include a thorough clinical and neurological examination followed by a more detailed examination to assess behaviour, locomotion and sensitivity to touch, sound and light stimuli. Other causes of central nervous system disease may be ruled out by a complete blood count, biochemical profile, urinalysis and examination of cerebrospinal fluid. Disturbances in behaviour, locomotion and sensitivity that occur singly, rather than in combination with each other, should be interpreted with caution.

      "abstract": "Dementia is a neuropsychiatric illness characterized by progressive cognitive impairment in clear consciousness. It has varied etiologies, with neurodegenerative conditions being most common causes.[1] By timely diagnosis and intervention, symptoms of dementia may be reversed or brought to minimal impairment. These groups of dementia are often labeled as 'Reversible dementias'[2] A 55-year-old married female, mother to two children, educated up to 8th standard, of middle S.E. status and rural background, was admitted to the psychiatry ward with symptoms characterized by agitation, disorientation, hallucinatory behavior, crying spells, ataxic gait, slurred speech, minimal self-care, altered sleep, and appetite. No history of substance use and restrictive dietary patterns was reported. On clinical examination, vitals were normal. Neurological examination showed 4/5 power in four limbs. On MSE, she was unkempt and had perplexed affect, visual hallucinations, and impaired attention and memory. Lobar function tests showed deficits in frontal and temporal lobes. In the frontal lobe, deficits were seen in set shifting, go-no-go test, graphic luria, and verbal fluency tests. In the temporal lobe, both verbal and visual memories were impaired. Montreal Organic Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) showed 6/30 with impairment in visuospatial/executive domain, naming, attention, language and abstraction. Mini mental status examination (MMSE) revealed 8/30 scores with deficits in visuospatial, concentration, language, and memory domains. On GPE, she had hyperpigmented macules in B/L hands. Dermatological C/L was taken, and clinical diagnosis of pellagra was made. Laboratory investigations showed low hemoglobin (9 g/dl), MCV (62.6 FL), MCH (18.1 pg), and slightly elevated ESR (50 mm/hr) and qCRP (40.6 mg/L). Serum folate levels and vitamin D and B12 levels were normal. MRI brain was insignificant. Duodenal biopsy revealed partial villous atrophy. Celiac disease was ruled out by the absence of the tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibody. Based on above findings, the diagnosis of organic dementia (F02.8) and pellagra (E52) was made. Although serologic and urinary assays for supporting the diagnosis were not available in our hospital, treatment with nicotinamide 300 mg per day orally in divided doses was started. The skin lesions improved significantly along with other objective meausures (MMSE 23/30 and MOCA 21/30 after 7 days, MMSE 26/30 and MOCA 24/30 after 3 weeks). Currently, the patient is under regular follow-up and is maintaining well in all sets of symptoms. All psychotropics were tapered off gradually. Pellagra is a rare nutritional deficiency with only sporadic cases occurring due to varied etiologies including malnutrition, G.I. tract diseases, malignancies, alcohol use, drugs (e.g., isoniazid), and carcinoid syndrome. Diagnosis of pellagra remains clinical, with characteristic skin lesions as pathognomic.[3] Neuropsychiatric manifestations can occur even without skin manifestations. The symptoms vary from lethargy, depression, anxiety, poor concentration, irritability to disorientation, confusion, and delirium. Eventually, the patient may become stuporous and comatose. Death may occur if left untreated.[4] In the index case, initial neuropsychiatric symptoms mimicked depression, and later, forgetfulness, cognitive decline, delirium, hallucinatory behavior led to diagnosis of dementia. With administration of niacin, dementia and dermatitis usually improve significantly within the first week of therapy. This case highlights need of comprehensive assessment and evaluation of every finding in context to reversible etiologies of dementia. Patient consent Duly signed patient consent was taken after explaining about the case report. Financial support and sponsorship Nil. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The terms “semantic dementia,” “semantic aphasia and associative agnosia,” “primary progressive aphasia,” “chronic progressive aphasia,” “temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia,” and “focal or asymmetric cortical degeneration syndrome” have all been applied to patients who exhibit a degenerative neurobehavioral disorder with progressive impairment predominantly or exclusively in the domain of language. When impairment is isolated to language, the term “primary progressive aphasia” is appropriate; when impairment is present in object naming (i.e., anomia) and word meaning (i.e., agnosia), with other aspects of language and cognition relatively intact, the term “semantic dementia” is apt. The initial symptom is typically “forgetfulness for names,” and although paraphasic errors, dyslexia, dysgraphia, visual agnosia, and executive dysfunction usually evolve with time, many patients perform daily activities remarkably well over the initial 2 to 5 years of symptoms. Progression can vary, with symptoms reflecting the topography of progressive cortical dysfunction. Typically, degeneration spreads posteriorly in the ipsilateral temporal lobe, with involvement eventually extending to the perisylvian, frontosubcortical, and sometimes superior parietal regions in the dominant hemisphere.",

      "abstract": "Recognizing depression in brain-damaged patients poses considerable problems. The standard diagnostic criteria often are not applicable since the neurological lesion may distort or even obliterate salient features of depression. Patients actually may deny being depressed or dysphoric, not have a depressive affect, or be totally unaware of abnormal vegetative behaviors. Furthermore, brain lesions themselves may produce striking behavioral alterations that can be mistakenly attributed to depression, or striking behavioral changes due to depression may be mistakenly attributed to the brain lesion. Based on five case studies, several clinical guidelines for recognizing and diagnosing depression in brain-damaged patients are offered. These cases also provide a data base to generate initial hypotheses about the neuroanatomical basis of the depressive syndrome. By observing how focal brain lesions modify the signs and symptoms of depression, inferences are made about brain areas crucial for modulating the various features of the depressive syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Medically unexplained visual loss, or functional visual loss, or nonorganic visual loss (NOVL) denotes diminished visual acuity or field without discernible ocular or neurological pathology. Variously termed in the literature, it eludes organic diagnosis following a thorough examination. Symptoms range from mild blurriness to total blindness, sometimes presenting as tunnel vision or hemianopias. Diagnosis entails comprehensive eye evaluation to exclude organic causes like refractive error or cataracts. NOVL frequently correlates with psychological conditions like depression or anxiety, implicating psychological influence in its etiology. Thus, NOVL underscores the complex interplay between physical and psychological factors in visual impairment, necessitating holistic diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This chapter elucidates the diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms pertaining to functional visual disorder (FVD) or nonorganic vision loss (NOVL), prevalent presentations posing diagnostic challenges across diverse medical disciplines. It delineates the historical evolution of terminology denoting patients manifesting vision loss incongruous with established neurological or ophthalmic pathologies, necessitating a collaborative, interprofessional approach. Diagnostic modalities, ranging from meticulous ocular assessments to comprehensive psychological evaluations, reflect the intricate etiological spectrum underlying NOVL. This exposition serves as a pivotal reference for healthcare professionals navigating the diagnostic intricacies and therapeutic imperatives intrinsic to NOVL, advocating for a holistic, patient-centric approach underscored by scientific rigor, and compassionate care.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Central nervous system manifestations of sarcoidosis are diverse. Cognitive decline is a recognized manifestation of neurosarcoidosis, yet detailed descriptions of this topic are limited in the literature. Case Report: A 44-year-old man with long-standing isolated neurosarcoidosis presented with a 7-year history of progressive cognitive decline in multiple domains. Known manifestations of this patient's neurosarcoidosis included panhypopituitarism, seizures, and ventricular loculation, which required shunt placement. He had required ongoing immunosuppression for treatment. The patient's neuropsychological profile confirmed decline in multiple cognitive domains affecting memory, basic and more complex attention skills, processing speed and flexibility, perceptual and constructional skills, and aspects of abstract thinking and problem-solving. His gross cognitive status was borderline, with relative preservation of verbal skills, and significant impairment of visuospatial skills. Overall, this patient's neuropsychological profile was suggestive of diffuse involvement, with frontal/ subcortical mechanisms appearing predominantly affected, perhaps with greater involvement of right hemisphere systems. Conclusions: This patient's progressive cognitive decline was attributable primarily to ongoing inflammatory disease from neurosarcoidosis. This case is discussed in the context of the existing literature on cognitive impairment and neurosarcoidosis, and adds to the small body of literature surrounding the chronic neurologic manifestations of this disease.",

      "title": "Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: What We Know Now",
      "abstract": "Small delays in onset of Alzheimer's Disease are predicted to reduce its global burden, but we need to better understand factors that increase the risk-and methods to reduce it. The clinical syndrome of dementia refers to a pattern of cognitive deficits characterized by impairment in memory and at least one other cognitive domain (e.g., language, executive functions, visuospatial abilities) that is sufficiently severe to impact behavior and interfere with social or occupational functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Dementia may be progressive, static, or remitting, and its onset and course of symptoms are a function of underlying neuropathology from various causes. For example, dementia because of a neurodegenerative process tends to involve an insidious onset with gradual progressive cognitive impairment. In contrast, dementia from vascular or acquired brain injury tends to involve an abrupt onset of clinical symptoms that may remain static or show stepwise cognitive decline that corresponds to episodes of cerebrovascular accidents. The most common causes of dementia are neuropathologically distinguished on the basis of the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease); multiple or strategically placed infarctions, ischemic injury, or hemorrhagic lesions (e.g., vascular dementia); cell loss and the deposition of Lewy bodies in sub-cortical, limbic, and neocortical regions (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies); and prominent frontal and temporal lobar atrophy (frontotemporal dementia). Dementia can also be found in the context of other neurological, infectious, or metabolic conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, human immunodeficiency virus, or traumatic brain injury. Despite recent advances in amyloid imaging and cerebral spinal fluid analysis, neuropathological changes are often only accurately assessed at autopsy. This makes definitive diagnosis during an individual's lifetime difficult. Effectively differentiating between forms of dementia or normal aging requires reliance on the neuropsychological definition of a specific pattern of cognitive deficits. Epidemiology and Neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's Disease is the leading cause of dementia in elders and accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of all dementia cases. An estimated 5.3 million Americans have Alzheimer's Disease. Reports indicate the disease is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and deaths because of Alzheimer's Disease are on the rise, with an increase of 46 percent between 2000 and 2006. Given the advancing age of the baby boom generation, by 2050, 14 million older Americans and 81 million adults worldwide are expected to have the disease (Alzheimer's Association, 2010a). Alzheimer's Disease is an age-related degenerative brain disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular fibrillar amyloid deposits and intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These characteristics lead to neuronal atrophy and synapse loss in medial temporal lobe limbic structures that are critical for episodic memory and extend to the association cortices of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes with disease progression (Braak and Braak, 1991). Consistent with these widespread neuropathological changes, the primary clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive global dementia syndrome that usually begins in later life. It is generally agreed that the pathological cascade of brain changes occurs gradually in Alzheimer's Disease, beginning with the very early accrual of Aβ plaques in the brain, and is followed by a variable lag time after which neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the leading pathological process (Jack et al., 2010). Although Aβ neuropathology is thought to be causal, clinical symptoms are more closely related to neurofibrillary tangles than amyloid deposition. …",

      "abstract": "Chronic renal failure and haemodialysis patients are prone to develop encephalopathy. The causes of encephalopathy are often unclear. Clinical signs of encephalopathy in the uraemic patient often overlap with several other affections causing neurological disorders. Whenever basal ganglia are anatomically involved, movement disorders arise, including chorea. Some acute and chronic neurological syndromes associated with chronic uraemia have consistently been reported (uraemic encephalopathy, dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, dialysis dementia, nephroangiosclerosis neuropathy and ageing neuropathy). Other clinical conditions in which neurological involvement exists are not so frequent in both haemodialysis patients and in the general population (Wernicke's encefalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease). Because of the non specific symptoms and the very heterogeneous aetiology, a careful physical examination should be performed in haemodialysis patients with clinical signs of encephalopathy and the main metabolic alterations should be sought; moreover, central nervous system imaging examination is often appropriate. In case of basal ganglia anatomical involvement, supported by findings of imaging techniques, it is necessary to evaluate individual causes of encephalopathy by means of more accurate tests including analysis of cerebro-spinal fluid, measurement of plasma levels of vitamin B components and laboratory tests searching for more uncommon diseases such as Huntington's chorea and Wilson's disease.",

Less frequent findings include: cerebellar signs (ataxia, nystagmus, saccadic pursuit); retinal degeneration; pes cavus; scoliosis; and parkinsonism with characteristic brain MRI features that include thinning of the corpus callosum. Onset occurs mainly during infancy or adolescence (range: age 1-31 years) and in rare cases as late as age 60 years. Most affected individuals become wheelchair bound one or two decades after disease onset. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SPG11 is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and MRI findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in SPG11 identified on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Care by a multidisciplinary team; physiotherapy to stretch spastic muscles; antispastic drugs such as baclofen; botulin toxin and intrathecal baclofen for severe and disabling spasticity when oral drugs are ineffective. Urodynamic evaluation when bladder dysfunction is evident; anticholinergic drugs for urinary urgency. Treatment of psychiatric manifestations by standard protocols. Prevention of secondary complications: Treatment of sphincter disturbances to prevent urinary tract infection secondary to bladder dysfunction. Surveillance: Evaluation every six months to adjust physiotherapy and medications. Genetic counseling SPG11 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If each parent is known to be heterozygous for an SPG11 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies are possible once the pathogenic variants in a family are known.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia with L ewy bodies ( DLB ) is defined pathologically as neurodegeneration associated with L ewy bodies ( LB ). LB ‐related symptoms, including olfactory dysfunction, dysautonomia, and mood and sleep disorders, are increasingly recognized as clinical signs that enable the early detection of DLB , because these symptoms often antedate dementia by years or even decades. It remains unknown if the clinical history of LB ‐related symptoms is sufficient for the prodromal state of DLB to be suspected in memory clinics. We retrospectively investigated the clinical courses, including olfactory dysfunction, dysautonomia, depression, and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, of 90 patients with probable DLB . The timing of LB ‐related symptoms that preceded or followed relative to the onset of memory loss was calculated. LB ‐related symptoms were present in 79 of 90 patients (87.8%) with probable DLB before or at the time of memory loss onset. These symptoms preceded the onset of memory loss between 1.2 and 9.3 years. We also report on four non‐demented patients with a clinical history of LB ‐related symptoms in our memory clinic. All four patients showed reduced cardiac [ 123 I ]‐metaiodobenzylguanidine levels. Moreover, [ 18 F ]fluoro‐D‐glucose positron emission tomography scans revealed glucose hypometabolism in the occipital cortex in two patients. One patient converted to probable DLB with the development of parkinsonism 2 years after major depression was diagnosed. Based on a clinical history of LB ‐related symptoms, we propose a conceptual framework to identify these symptomatic but non‐demented individuals that led us to suspect the underlying pathophysiology of L ewy body disease. Further prospective study is warranted to determine the clinical significance of LB ‐related symptoms in non‐demented patients.",

Dementia with Lewy bodies presents as a mix of cognitive, behavioral, and, in particular, physical changes that help distinguish it from other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease. Parkinsonism is most often seen in Parkinson’s disease but is also a hallmark of dementia with Lewy bodies. Meanwhile, neuropsychological testing shows that patients with dementia with Lewy bodies tend to have more executive or visuospatial problems than those with Alzheimer’s disease.

A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep problem affecting nearly one-third of the population as either a primary or comorbid condition. Insomnia has been defined as both a symptom and a disorder, and is characterized as sleep that is chronically unrestorative or poor in quality often due to difficulty in initiating sleep, in maintaining sleep, or with waking up too early. Insomnia results in some form of daytime impairment in the patient's normal activites. Although the exact pathophysiology of insomnia is poorly understood, it is often believed to arise from a state of hyperarousal in multiple neurophysiological and/or psychological systems. Population-based studies suggest that while about one-third of the general population complains of sleep disturbance, only 10-15 percent has associated symptoms of daytime functional impairment, and even fewer, only 6-10 percent have impairments sufficient for the diagnostic criteria of insomnia. The cornerstone of the insomnia evaluation and diagnosis is a comprehensive history obtained by the clinical interview with patient and/or family. Additional assessment tools, such as sleep diary or log, various questionnaires, actigraphy, and multichannel polysomnography (PSG) have been used as an aid to diagnosis, although many are limited in their validation. Insomnia causes a significant burden of medical, psychiatric, societal consequences on the individual and societal level. Clinicians in either primary settings or specialized clinics should have knowledge to manage insomnia with confidence.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

      "title": "The Effects of Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders on Waking Performance",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSleep is a necessary and reversible behavioural state of perception, cognition, psyche and physical conditions.Abnormal sleep behaviours may include e.g.difficulties in falling asleep, breathing difficulties such as different kinds of apneas, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep onset-REM, leg movements, sleepwalking, sleep talking, tooth grinding and other physical activities.These anomalies involving sleep processes also include sleep itself, dream imagery or muscle weakness.Within sleep there are two separate states, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eyes movement (REM).REM sleep is defined by EEG activation, muscle atony, and episodic bursts of rapid eye movement.NREM (non-REM) sleep is subdivided into four stages (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 -Rechtschaffen & Kales) or three stages (N1, N2 and N3 -AASM), which are defined by the electroencephalogram (EEG).The NREM stages are parallel to the depth of sleep continuum (lowest in stage 1 and highest in stage 4 sleep).NREM sleep and REM sleep continue to alternate through the night in cyclically.REM sleep episodes become longer across the night, stages 3 and 4 become shorter across the night.Sleep disorders have an impact on the structure and distribution of sleep.A distinction is important in diagnosis and in the choice of treatments.There are three very important sleep disorders: Insomnia, Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea Syndrome.Altogether, in Western Europe already suffer more than 10 % of the population from Sleep-Awake-Disturbances which has to be treated urgently; 800,000 from Sleep Apnea Syndromes and 25,000 from Narcolepsy (PETER et al. 1995).1. Insomnia is a sleeplessness and includes a decreased total sleep time, a poor sleep efficiency too little and a poor sleep quality caused by one or more of the following: trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep latency), waking up a lot during the night with trouble returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, and/or having unrefreshing sleep/not feeling well rested (even after sleeping 7 to 8 hours at night).Under this criterion the frequency is in the western industrial countries between 20-30 % in which about 10-15 % suffer under a very severe illness and 40 % of all depressions may be preceded by insomnia first.2. Narcolepsy is a genetic disorder and characterized by sleep onset REM sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.www.intechopen.comSleep Disorders 118 The exact prevalence of the general population is unknown.Great differences exist in its appearance frequency.So the frequency of Japan is 0.16 % and of Israel 0.0002 %.Central Europe (0.006 %) and the USA (0.06-0.1 %) are located in the middle.3. Sleep Apnea Syndromes (SAS) are common disorders, which are characterized by repeated oropharyngeal occlusions occurring during the sleep time (sleep-related breathing problems, intermittent hypoxemia) and may be associated with suppression of SWS sleep (disrupted and fragmentized sleep architecture).Due to intermittent hypoxemia and disrupted sleep architecture, SAS leads to impaired daytime functioning in various (neuro)psychological and affective domains and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, principally from adipositas, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.The prevalence of moderate SAS (AHI >15/h) is 9% in male and 4% in female, respectively.25-30 % Sleep Apnea Syndromes were described at patients with hypertension and 35-45 % with patients with on the left heart-failure.The SAS frequency increases with an advancing age and reaches their peak at the age from 50 to 70 years.80% of the patients suffer under excessive daytime sleepiness and a reduced sustained attention.Resulting from this it comes to performance losses both professional and in the ability to drive motor vehicles.Fragmentation of sleep and increased frequency of arousals occur in association with this three disorders and a number of other sleep disorders as well as with medical disorders involving physical pain or discomfort.In this chapter, the author will describe neuropsychological dysfunctions/courses and neuropsychiatric syndromes due sleep disorders which were characterized by 1. excessive daytime sleepiness 2. attention deficit, 3. memory dysfunction, 4. executive dysfunction, 5. driving difficulties, 6. motivation and emotional deficits, 7. psychiatric consequences (e.g.depression, anxiety) and 8. lack of ability to recognize the effects of behaviour.There are wide varieties of difficulties in assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and behavioural disability after sleep disorders.In our studies we used neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric methods in different patient groups in a sleep laboratory.Over the past five years we have been testing and treating more than 2000 patients with different sleep disorders and more than 5000 neurological patients.During admission to the clinic, all patients were selected according to their clinical diagnosis (ICD-10) and were examined neurologically, (neuro)psychologically, psychiatrically and medically.The test persons must not suffer from any severe psychiatric disorders.The study was carried out involving randomly selected patients with sleep disorders.

More than 50% of the patients could report having had one or more such traits with an even distribution between males and females except for enuresis, which was recorded more frequently in males. The presence of such traits was correlated to adult mental health. No correlation was found between one single trait and later disorders. There was a positive correlation between two or more traits and neurotic states of anxiety or conversion neurosis, but no correlation with depressive disorders or psychosomatic diseases (after Alexander's concept).",

To describe the behavioral neuropsychiatric symptoms of MCI in two subgroups of MCI patients with different neuropsychological characteristics. MCI patients are classified as amnestic (aMCI) if they have a prominent memory impairment, either alone or with other cognitive impairments (multiple domains with amnesia), or nonamnestic (naMCI) if a single nonmemory domain is impaired alone or in combination with other nonmemory deficits (multiple domains without amnesia). The K-Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was administrated to detect behavioral and psychological disturbances observed by the caregiver. 58 subjects were analyzed: 43 were classified as aMCI and 15 as naMCI. About 76% of MCI patients had some neuropsychiatric symptoms evaluated with the NPI and the most prevalent symptom was depression, followed by anxiety & apathy. A significantly higher prevalence of hallucinations has been observed in the naMCI group in comparison with the aMCI group. Neuropsychiatric symptoms occur in the majority of persons with MCI. A significantly higher prevalence of hallucinations has been observed in the naMCI group in comparision with the aMCI group. Neuropsychological & behavioral assessment is considered as an importment step in the categorization of subjects with MCI.",

It can also be the presenting feature of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as atypical Alzheimer's disease. We report a case of a 62-year-old lady who presented with simultanagnosia, optic apraxia, and ocular ataxia which are the typical signs and symptoms of this syndrome. Neuropsychological evaluation revealed severe affection of the visual-spatial function with intact memory, language, and cognition. Brain imaging confirmed atrophy and decreased perfusion in the posterior parietal and occipital lobes. No underlying cause could be identified to explain the brain parenchymal atrophy.

It can be primary or secondary, signs and symptoms of which include exorbitant daytime sleepiness, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep and difficulty falling asleep. A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

Its clinical presentation is extremely variable, especially for what concerns the cognitive level and the behavioral phenotype. Such aspects, as well as the dysmorphic/malformative ones, have been covered by previous studies; otherwise neurological features have never been systematically described. In order to delineate the neurological phenotype of Potocki-Lupski Syndrome, we collect an 8-patients cohort. Developmental milestones are delayed and a mild to moderate cognitive impairment is present in all patients, variably associated with features of autism spectrum disorder, behavioral disturb, and sleep disturb. Hypotonia appears a less frequent finding than what previously reported, while motor clumsiness/coordination impairment is frequent. EGG registration demonstrated a common pattern with excess of diffuse rhythmic activity in sleep phases or while the patient is falling asleep. Brain MRI did not reveal common anomalies, although unspecific white matter changes may be present. We discuss such findings and compare them to literature data, offering an overview on the neurological and cognitive-behavioral presentation of the syndrome.",

      "abstract": "SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder of unknown aetiology which can present with myriad clinical presentation. The neurological manifestations of SLE consist of central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system manifestations (PNS). The CNS manifestations are aseptic meningitis, cerebrovascular accidents (stroke), demyelinating disorders, headache, involuntary movements like chorea, myelopathy, acute confusional states, cognitive dysfunction, mood disorder, seizures, psychosis and cranial nerve palsies.1 The PNS manifestations are Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS), autonomic disorder, mononeuropathy, polyneuropathy and plexopathy.1 Neuropathy in SLE can be clinically classified as mononeuritis multiplex and symmetrical and asymmetrical polyneuropathy. Symmetrical polyneuropathy being the most commonly seen clinical entity amongst the neuropathies in SLE. The neuropathy can be slowly progressive or acute in onset. Electrophysiologically, neuropathy is classified as axonal neuropathy, small fibre neuropathy, demyelinating neuropathy, mixed axonal-demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy and plexopathy. Axonal neuropathy is further divided into sensory, sensorimotor and mononeuritis multiplex. Demyelinating neuropathy can be of two types: acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) and sensory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Anecdotal case reports also suggest that CIDP can occur as part of SLE neuropathy.2.",

      "title": "The Neurobiology of Infantile Autism",
      "abstract": "Early infantile autism is the most severe of a group of neurodevelopmental syndromes called the pervasive developmental disorders. The clinical features of autism vary greatly, but, by definition, include deficits in social relatedness, communication, and interests or routines. The onset of autistic signs and behaviors typ ically occurs in infancy, and the syndrome is usually fully present by the fourth year. The presence of mental retardation affects the clinical picture greatly. Severely autistic children may be retarded and mute and are often preoccupied with repetitive activities; they often exhibit motor stereotypes, such as rocking or hand flapping. They can be profoundly withdrawn and may show extreme aversion to social or physical contact. More mildly affected children may have normal or even superior intelligence, with well-developed language skills. Their deficits in social relatedness and preoccupation with rituals and routines may set them apart as very odd, but not necessarily as autistic. Autism occurs in 1 of 2000 live births; boys outnumber girls about 3 or 4:1. Although there are no localizing neurological signs in autism, mild or \"soft\" neurological signs are common and grand mal seizures are frequently present after puberty (Lotspeich LJ, Ciaranello RD.

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

This is partly because the nervous system is a communications system with direct access to consciousness, so that the patient is in a unique position to monitor his own disorder. Clinical diagnosis becomes very difficult in the presence of dysphasia, confusion or dementia. Another reason is that useful biochemical and histological information about the function of neurons is rarely available, in contrast to the wealth of data used in the assessment of diseases of other organs, such as the lungs, liver or kidneys. The failure of neurons in the CNS to regenerate means that delay in making a precise diagnosis can worsen the eventual outcome; the clinician often cannot afford to watch how an illness progresses before intervening.",

      "abstract": "Neurosyphilis presents a significant diagnostic challenge in psychiatric settings due to its highly variable neuropsychiatric manifestations, which can mimic a range of other psychiatric disorders. This case report describes a 36-year-old male admitted with acute psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior. His clinical history revealed previously treated syphilis, with no subsequent follow-up, and recent progressive cognitive and behavioral changes, ultimately leading to a diagnosis of neurosyphilis (specifically general paresis) following serological confirmation. This case highlights the complexities in diagnosing neurosyphilis, as its symptoms often overlap with common psychiatric conditions, making it easy to overlook in routine assessments. Importantly, the diagnosis required a high index of suspicion due to the patient’s psychiatric presentation combined with a background of untreated syphilis. Considering neurosyphilis in the differential diagnosis can be challenging, especially when psychiatric symptoms like depression, cognitive decline, and psychosis appear in the absence of clear neurological signs and when there is no follow-up on prior infections. The resurgence of syphilis and its neurological complications remains a concern, particularly in psychiatric populations where risk factors such as substance use disorders, socioeconomic challenges, and limited access to healthcare are prevalent. This case underscores the critical role of psychiatrists in screening for syphilis, especially in patients at risk or in areas with high syphilis prevalence. Early and accurate diagnosis, coupled with appropriate treatment using penicillin, can halt disease progression and mitigate severe neuropsychiatric outcomes. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis in psychiatric patients and considering neurosyphilis in cases of unexplained psychiatric symptoms.",

Preschizophrenic infants show a fluctuating dysregulation of maturationm—or \"pandevelopmental retardation\" (PDR)m—that involves physical growth; gross motor, visual-motor, and cognitive development; proprioceptive and vestibular responses; muscle tone; and possibly arousal. Pandevelopmental retardation was significantly related to a genetic history for schizophrenia (&lt;.05), but not to obstetric complications. The severity of PDR was significantly related to the severity of later psychiatric and cognitive disorder (&lt;.01). Pandevelopmental retardation provides a \"marker\" in infancy for the inherited neurointegrative defect in schizophrenia.

Low-level, chronic exposure is most likely to present as a psychological masquerade. The most common exposure is low-dose exposure over an extended period of time, with mental symptoms developing gradually and physical complaints being nonspecific. Lethargy and clouding of consciousness may progress to coma, seizures, and death. Individuals with subclinical lead poisoning may have disturbances of mood as well as deficits in visuomotor coordination, hand–eye coordination, muscle strength, rapid motor control, memory, and visual intelligence. Lead poisoning remains a significant public health concern. Currently low level exposure is more common in the United States than acute, high-level toxicity. Lead is a heavy metal that combines with other elements to form organic and inorganic compounds. The central nervous system is especially sensitive to toxic effects of lead, making mental disturbances prominent in the presentation of lead poisoning.",

Seven patients experienced alterations of the sense of familiarity for a familiar object or place, for the misidentified person in a novel role, for personal characteristics, or for unfamiliar events as familiar. Five of these had persecutory delusions. These cases suggest that person misidentification in dementia begins with an altered sense of familiarity for a familiar person from a mismatch of new perceptions with past memories. They are sustained by paranoid elaboration or confabulatory rationalisation of a double.",

      "abstract": "The symptoms of a degenerative brain disease are dictated by its topography. Visuo-spatial impairment may be a severe and early feature of degenerative dementia. Visual symptoms in such patients are broadly divisible into dorsal and ventral visual syndromes, which result from a degenerative focus in occipito-parietal and occipito-temporal visual association cortices, respectively. The dorsal visual syndrome includes asimultanagnosia and Balint's syndrome. The ventral visual syndrome includes alexia and visual agnosia (prosopagnosia). Less often, hemineglect or visual field defects result. When Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease present in this way there is a topographic shift of neurodegenerative changes to posteriorly situated cortices. Patients with corticobasal ganglionic degeneration often develop symptomatic involvement of contiguous sensorimotor cortices causing mixed perceptual-motor syndromes. Even in patients with more typical patterns of dementia, the degree of visuo-spatial impairment may hinder driving skills, and the issue of driving should be addressed early in the clinical course.",

      "title": "Phantom vestibular perception: Unfeasible or unnoticed?",
      "abstract": "Objective: Phantom percepts frequently accompany the loss or damage of body parts or sensation, and have been described for virtually everything except for the vestibular system. Is it possible that phantom vestibular percepts exist and explain some cases of chronic dizziness, or is there something unique to the vestibular system that forbids this? Study design: This review surveyed the literature for any references to phantom vestibular perceptions. This was followed by a broader survey of phantom phenomena. Areas of focus were hearing, the limbs, and vision, and these were theoretically related to the vestibular system. Results: There apparently are no references to vestibular phantoms. There is robust research on tinnitus, phantom limb syndrome, and phantom eye syndrome. There are similar features and proposed aetiological models among these syndromes. Conclusion: It is within reason that vestibular phantom percepts exist, but to date have gone unnoticed due to the subjective nature of vestibular symptoms. However, the vestibular system is unique in several ways that may make phantom percepts far less likely than with other sensory systems. In particular, the cerebral cortex does not have any areas with exclusively vestibular input. In addition, the brainstem processes bilateral vestibular inputs in a unique push-pull mechanism, and synaptic plasticity in the vestibular nucleus facilitates compensation from vestibular injuries. In addition, unlike other senses, there is no conscious perception of vestibular laterality (i.e. which side is injured). This intriguing concept is challenging to prove.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a condition characterized by subjective complaints of insufficient sleep and poor daytime functioning. Objective measures of sleep and daytime functioning, however, seldom show evidence of a similar degree of dysfunction. Most insomniacs, for example, do not suffer from sleep deprivation or daytime sleepiness. This discrepancy between subjective and objective measures of sleep and daytime functioning suggests that cognitive factors may play a central role in persistent insomnia. In particular, it is argued that fears about insufficient sleep and its adverse daytime consequences tend to interfere with sleep, thereby causing a vicious cycle which serves to maintain the insomnia. It is also argued that perfectionist standards and other dysfunctional beliefs may predispose people to these kinds of fears. Finally, existing models for cognitive-behavioural treatment of insomnia are criticized for being almost exclusively focused on the night-time aspects of insomnia. If insomnia is maintained by various kinds of vicious cycles involving fears, beliefs, and standards with regard to daytime functioning, these daytime aspects of insomnia should receive more attention in cognitive-behavioural treatment.

If the preclinical nerve damage can be detected early, the deformities and disabilities can be prevented to a large extent. Aims: To assess the electrophysiological functions of the ulnar and median nerve trunks in cases of clinically manifest leprosy with and without manifest nerve damage at different durations of nerve damage. Materials and Methods: Electrophysiological functions of ulnar and median nerves were studied in leprosy patients, both normal and at different stages of disease and damage. PB cases, having disease for six months or less, without neurological symptoms and clinically normal appearing nerve. Statistical Methods: Mean was taken of different values. The changes in values of different parameters were expressed as percentage change with reference to the control values (increase or decrease). Results: Reduced nerve conduction velocities and changes in latency and amplitude were observed. Changes in sensory nerve conduction were more pronounced. Sensory latencies and amplitude changes were more severe than motor latencies and amplitudes in cases with manifest muscle palsies. Changes in MB cases were less marked. Conclusions: Further studies are needed to identify parameters likely to be helpful in the diagnosis of early nerve damage.",

Neurological involvement is uncommon in pSS, involving the central nervous system in 2-5% of cases and more frequently the peripheral nervous system in 5-15% of cases. The diagnosis of pSS is to be considered when confronted with symptoms such as mouth and eye dryness, fatigue and pain, the most frequent of pSS symptoms. Objective measures of oral and eye dryness may help assert the diagnosis of pSS, as well as ACR/EULAR criteria. Differential diagnoses have to be excluded in patients exhibiting neurological symptoms, such as cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis or multiple sclerosis, before considering a neurological involvement specific to pSS. The treatment of these neurological manifestations takes into account different parameters, such as the presence of cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis, the severity of the symptoms, a rapidly progressing evolution and the failure of previous symptomatic treatments.",

      "title": "Mixed dementia and hyperactive delirium: a diagnostic challenge",
      "abstract": "It is well recognised that acute confusion or delirium complicates up to 10% of acute medical admissions. Disorientation in time and place with an impaired short-term memory and conscious level are the hallmarks of an acute confusion. In delirium, disorders of perception may produce restlessness and agitation. A similar state during the final days of life is termed ‘terminal delirium’. Less than 10% of affected individuals will have a primary neurological disorder, for example, dementia, a neurodegenerative disease with varying aetiologies. Currently there are at least 50 million people globally suffering from dementia rendering it a global healthcare problem. Mixed dementia (MD) can be defined as a cognitive decline sufficient to impair independent functioning in daily life resulting from the coexistence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cerebrovascular pathology. MD occurs in patients with a neurodegenerative disorder, such as AD, Lewy body or Pick’s disease and additionally cerebrovascular disease. The mechanistic synergisms between the coexisting pathologies affecting dementia risk, progression and the ultimate clinical manifestations remain elusive. Although AD can be diagnosed with a considerable degree of accuracy, the distinction between isolated AD, vascular dementia and MD, when both pathologies coexist in the same patient remains one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges because their clinical presentation can overlap. Neuropathological studies indicate that mixed vascular Alzheimer’s dementia (MD) has a prevalence of 22% in the elderly. The authors present the case of a 78-year-old man with a diagnosis of MD presenting to the emergency department with delirium, a common but serious acute neuropsychiatric syndrome with the core features of inattention and global cognitive dysfunction. This case demonstrates the challenges in establishing a diagnosis in patients presenting with MD and shows that a cognitive assessment at presentation in a delirious state offers very little diagnostic information. It is therefore suggested to conduct a routine cognitive function examination on patients with dementia to anticipate new neurological signs and/or symptoms thus allowing earlier diagnosis and treatment. However, a baseline cognitive assessment when the patient was well, duration and nature of deterioration as well as collateral history will help differentiate delirium from an underlying dementia.",

Dementia may be symptomatic of a range of reversible medical and psychiatric conditions which appear to be indistinguishable from primary neuronal degeneration of the Alzheimer's type. While Alzheimer's disease is a neuropathological diagnosis, the importance of establishing a presumptive diagnosis which can be employed for investigational as well as clinical use is underscored. This paper proposes a diagnostic schema which reflects the current understanding of this disorder. There must be evidence of gradual progressive mental deterioration in attention, learning, memory, cognitive style, motivation, and higher order thinking. A comprehensive medical and psychiatric evaluation is obligatory to eliminate reversible physical illness, psychiatric disorder, or cerebrovascular condition as underlying causes of cognitive dysfunction.",

It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

Changes in the cranial nerve examination primarily relate to an age-related decline in sensory functions, especially of vision and hearing, and to a restriction in the range of eye movements, especially vertically. A progressive decline in the bulk and strength of muscles and in the speed and coordination of movements has long been recognised as an accompaniment of aging. Posture and gait show conspicuous changes with advancing age, partially correlating with diminished sensation in the legs and/or with a nonspecific bradykinetic senile gait. The distal depression of deep tendon reflexes and sensory function is primarily due to distal degeneration of sensory axons. Among the release signs, only the reappearance of the grasp reflex is a reliable sign for indicating pathology of the nervous system. Senile tremor, a decline in the maintenance of thermal homoeostasis, an increasing frequency of orthostatic hypotension, and disorders of sleep are also commonly associated with aging.",

Here, we review the research into visual illusion perception in schizophrenia and the issues which previous research has faced. One general finding that emerged from the literature is that those with schizophrenia are mostly immune to the effects of high-level illusory displays, but this effect is not consistent across all low-level illusions. The present review suggests that this resistance is due to the weakening of top–down perceptual mechanisms and may be relevant to the understanding of symptoms of visual distortion rather than hallucinations as previously thought.",

      "title": "Reward‐related cognitive vulnerability to bipolar spectrum disorders",
      "abstract": "Bipolar spectrum disorders (BSDs) are characterized by extreme swings of mood (euphoria or irritability versus sadness), cognition (grandiosity and racing thoughts versus worthlessness and concentration difficulties), and behavior (supercharged energy and excessive goal-striving versus anhedonia and lethargy) occurring within the same individual. They are prevalent, associated with significant disability, and occur on a continuum of severity, from milder cyclothymia to bipolar II to full-blown bipolar I disorder. Individuals' cognitive styles (i.e., the general filters they use to process information and construe events in their lives) may provide vulnerability to BSD symptoms and episodes. Indeed, individuals with BSDs exhibit cognitive styles with certain unique reward-relevant features1, 2 and these cognitive styles have been shown to predict the onset and course of BSDs3. According to the reward hypersensitivity theory3, 4, individuals with or vulnerable to BSDs possess a hypersensitive reward system, linked to a dopaminergic fronto-striatal neural circuit subserving approach motivation and goal-directed behavior, that overreacts to goals or reward-relevant cues. This hypersensitivity leads to excessive approach-related affect and incentive motivation in response to life events involving goal-striving and attainment, which in turn leads to hypomanic/manic symptoms. It also can lead to excessive downregulation or decrease in approach-related affect and motivation in response to non-attainment of goals or rewards (e.g., irreconcilable losses or failures), which in turn leads to bipolar depressive symptoms. Thus, a propensity toward excessive reward system activation and deactivation is the hypothesized vulnerability to BSDs in this model. The model also proposes that vulnerable individuals' reward hypersensitivity leads to behaviors that increase their exposure (via \"stress generation\" processes) to the very goal- and reward-relevant events that, in turn, precipitate excessive responses from their reward systems. To date, extensive self-report, behavioral, cognitive, life event, neurophysiological and neural evidence supports this reward hypersensitivity model of BSDs3, 4. High reward sensitivity may be a temperament trait that contributes to the development of reward-relevant cognitive styles1. In line with this hypothesis, euthymic bipolar individuals have been found to exhibit a distinctive profile of cognitive styles characterized by perfectionism, self-criticism and autonomy rather than the dependency and approval-seeking styles observed among unipolar depressed individuals1. Additionally, controlling for current mood symptoms, individuals with BSDs exhibit higher achievement motivation, goal-attainment dysfunctional attitudes (e.g., \"A person should do well at everything\") and ambitious goal-striving styles than controls1, 2. The strongest evidence confirming that reward-relevant cognitive styles provide vulnerability to BSDs comes from a prospective study5, which found that, controlling for initial mood symptoms and family history of bipolar disorder, adolescents with no prior history of BSD who exhibited an ambitious goal-striving cognitive style at baseline had a greater likelihood and shorter time to first lifetime onset of BSD than those without that cognitive style. Additionally, a cognitive style characterized by ambitious goal-striving mediated the predictive association between high self-reported reward sensitivity and shorter time to first onset of BSD in this adolescent sample5, further suggesting that ambitious goal-striving is a vulnerability trait to BSDs that may account for some of the risk associated with reward sensitivity. Ambitious goal-striving cognitive styles, perfectionism, and a tendency to overgeneralize from success (rewards) have also been observed in individuals with no prior history of BSD but at behavioral risk for developing a bipolar disorder6, 7. Further, controlling for baseline hypomanic symptoms, a cognitive style to overgeneralize from success interacted with self-reported reward hypersensitivity to predict increases in hypomanic symptoms among adolescents with no prior history of BSD8. Reward-relevant cognitive styles also affect the course of BSDs. In individuals with bipolar I disorder, ambitious goal-striving for financial success and popular fame predicted increases in manic symptoms over a three-month follow-up2. In addition, controlling for past history of mood episodes and baseline symptoms, late adolescents with bipolar II disorder or cyclothymia who possessed self-critical or autonomous reward-relevant cognitive styles at baseline had a greater likelihood of hypomanic and manic episodes over a three-year follow-up than adolescents who did not exhibit these styles1. Moreover, an autonomous cognitive style mediated the predictive association between self-reported reward hypersensitivity and prospective occurrence of hypomanic and manic episodes in this sample1. Finally, in the same sample, reward-relevant life events interacted with reward-related cognitive styles to predict bipolar mood symptoms9. Specifically, controlling for initial mood symptoms and total number of life events experienced, baseline perfectionistic and self-critical cognitive styles interacted with reward system-activating positive events to predict increases in hypomanic/manic symptoms, and with reward system-deactivating negative events (e.g., certain failures) to predict increases in depressive symptoms over follow-up9. Reward-relevant cognitive styles may not always be maladaptive. Indeed, the high achievement motivation and ambitious goal-striving may contribute to high levels of creativity and achievement also exhibited by many individuals with BSDs or at behavioral risk for developing a bipolar disorder6. The role of reward-relevant cognitive styles in the onset and course of BSDs has implications for psychosocial interventions for these disorders, particularly for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which has been shown to have efficacious prophylactic effects for BSDs10. There may be added value to CBT interventions that specifically target achievement, ambitious goal-striving, and reward-oriented cognitive schemas in managing BSDs10. For example, the therapist might develop a plan in which surges of ambitious goal-setting and overconfidence are identified and challenged during prodromal periods to lessen the likelihood of a manic episode onset10. In summary, ambitious goal-striving cognitive styles appear to be involved in the vulnerability to onset and recurrences of mood episodes in individuals with BSDs. Thus, these styles may be an excellent target for preventive and therapeutic interventions for individuals with bipolar disorders. Lauren B.

The disease is characterized by fragmentary, symmetric, or generalized myoclonic and/or generalized tonic-clonic seizures, visual hallucinations (occipital seizures), and progressive neurologic degeneration including cognitive and/or behavioral deterioration, dysarthria, and ataxia. The frequency and intractability of seizures increase over time. Status epilepticus is common. Emotional disturbance and confusion are common at or soon after onset of seizures and are followed by dementia. Dysarthria and ataxia appear early, spasticity late. Pathologically polyglucosan inclusion bodies (Lafora body) are seen which are pathognomonic of the disease and are not seen in any other types of PMEs. Electroencephalogram (EEG) reveals slowing of background and generalized spike/polyspike-and-waves and photosensitivity.

      "abstract": "Various research studies show that the amalgam of disordered sleep physiology, chronic fatigue, diffuse myalgia, and cognitive and behavioural symptoms constitutes a non-restorative sleep syndrome that may follow a febrile illness, as in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Where rheumatic complaints are prominent such a constellation of disturbed sleep physiology and symptoms also characterizes the fibromyalgia disorder. In contrast to the chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia is associated with a variety of initiating or perpetuating factors such as psychologically distressing events, primary sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder) and inflammatory rheumatic disease, as well as an acute febrile illness. The chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia have similar disordered sleep physiology, namely an alpha rhythm disturbance (7.5–11 Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep that accompanies increased nocturnal vigilance and light, unrefreshing sleep. Aspects of cytokine and cellular immune functions are shown to be related to the sleep-wake system. The evidence suggests a reciprocal relationship of the immune and sleep-wake systems. Interference either with the immune system (e.g. by a viral agent or by cytokines such as α-interferon or interleukin 2) or with the sleeping-waking brain system (e.g. by sleep deprivation) has effects on the other system and will be accompanied by the symptoms of the chronic fatigue syndrome.",

The authors report 5 patients with psychotic mood disorders and long-standing antipsychotic drug therapy.

Nearly coincident with this reaction, they developed progressive cognitive deficits consistent with frontotemporal dementia. These patients illustrate emergent neuroleptic hypersensitivity as an early manifestation of other dementias.

Alzheimer's disease, the most common, is typified by a slow onset and relentless progression to complete incapacitation. Vascular dementia usually appears somewhat abruptly, is associated with vascular comorbidities, and has an unpredictable progression pattern. Lewy body dementia shares features of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease; its hallmarks include fluctuating cognitive performance, visual hallucinations, and extrapyramidal motor symptoms. Frontotemporal dementias are associated less with memory disorders and more with behavioral and language aberrations.

They may also characterize some frontal or temporal nocturnal seizures of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, or be considered as part of NREM parasomnias, especially sleepwalking, sexsomnia or sleep-related eating disorder, or REM-related behaviors such as REM behavior disorder or complex movements associated with pediatric narcolepsy type I. In most cases rhythmic movements, especially when complex and long in duration, are related to different levels of arousal from sleep with recurrence of ancestral motor sequences promoted by central pattern generators in the brainstem, generally activated by the arousal process. A differential diagnosis between physiological events and pathological movement disorders, and between the latter and sleep-related epilepsy is critical to provide optimal treatment and an accurate prognosis. Specific treatment options for the aforementioned disorders are beyond the scope of this article.",

Specifically, exposure to drugs, alcohol and tobacco use, dietary intake, and occupational background should be investigated in any patient presenting with the bilateral symmetric slow visual loss.Early in the disease, optic nerves usually appear normal or, on occasion, slightly hyperemic. Continued exposure to a toxic substance or nutrient deficiency would cause the slow appearance of bilateral temporal optic disc pallor due to the injury of ganglion cell axons specifically in the papillomacular nerve fiber bundle. This would eventually lead to the diffuse pallor of the optic disc.

      "title": "A Clinical Profile of Coma",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nImpaired consciousness is among the most difficult and dramatic of clinical problems. The brain tolerates only limited physical or metabolic injury, so that impaired consciousness is often a sign of impending irreparable damage to the brain. Stupor and coma imply advanced\r\nbrain failure, just as, for example, uremia means renal failure, and the longer such brain failure lasts the narrower the margin between recovery and the development of permanent neurologic injury. The limited time for action and the multiplicity of potential causes of brain\r\nfailure challenge the physician. The physician must organize available information to anticipate as accurately as possible the likelihood that the patient will either recover or remain permanently disabled. Prospective studies of prognosis in adults and children\r\nindicate that within a few hours or days after the onset of coma, neurologic signs and electrophysiologic markers in many patients differentiate, with a high degree of probability, the extremes of no improvement or good recovery. Unfortunately, radiologic and biochemical indicators have generally provided less accurate predictions of outcome, with some exceptions.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nTo determine the incidence, etiology, and outcome of coma, to determine the commonest causes of coma, to recognize unusual presentations and to assess the prognosis in these patients.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nA total of 100 consecutive patients admitted in a comatose state to the IMCU/medical ward in Government Stanley Medical College, were enrolled in this study after prior written and informed consent.\r\nPeriod of the Study: February 2010 To April 2010.\r\nMETHODOLOGY:\r\nA detailed case history was taken.Depression of consciousness was assessed by the GCS. A detailed clinical examination was done.Investigations were guided by the clinical presentation. Neurological outcomes were determined as intact(normal or no change from\r\npre-morbid condition), impaired (alteration of tone,power or reflexes,cranial nerve dysfunction, ataxia, seizures, persistent vegetative state) or death.\r\nInclusion Criteria:\r\n• Cases with coma &focal signs,\r\n• Those without focal signs,\r\n• Cases with coma & fever.\r\nExclusion Criteria:\r\n• Head injury.\r\n• Toxin ingestion.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe GCS is a valuable tool but it may not account for the localized motor, speech and language deficits associated with a focal lesion and hence its accuracy may be affected which has an impact on its prognostic value. The presence of pupillary /eye signs may not portend a poor prognosis in all cases especially in hypoxic injury.\r\nThe initial GCS may be deceptively low in alcoholics. Caution is required while interpreting the clinical findings in alcoholics. There may be difficulties in differentiating the more serious injuries from reversible signs.\r\nThe presence of seizures in a comatose patient may not always signify a poor prognosis in all cases.\r\nThe limitations of our study are that it is an observational study and the number of patients\r\nanalyzed may not be significant to apply the results to a larger population. The observed proportion might represent the lower limit of a confidence interval rather than the mean. Also, actual outcome from the illness in many instances could be worse than the best neurologic state because some patients who recovered temporarily (48 hrs) died of complications later.\r\nA multimodal work up including brain CT, MRI, EEG, somatosensory evoked potentials and clinical examination might be useful in predicting accurate prognosis than any of them alone.",

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is nerve\r\ndamage that occurs because of the metabolic degenerations associated with diabetes\r\nmellitus. The most common symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy include pain,\r\nburning, tingling, or numbness in the toes or feet, and extreme sensitivity to light touch. The\r\npain may be worst at rest and improve with activity, such as walking. Some people initially\r\nhave intensely painful feet while others have few or no symptoms. Diabetic peripheral\r\nneuropathy usually affects both sides of the body. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy treated\r\nwith main three components that is , tight control of blood sugar levels , care for the feet to\r\nprevent complications and Control of pain caused by neuropathy. Diabetic patients are\r\nencouraged to follow a daily leg exercises , foot care regimens like washing , and inspecting\r\nthe foot proper fitting shoes can prevent major complications.\r\nA study was done to evaluate the effectiveness of exercises on pain and sleep among\r\npatients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in selected hospitals, Erode.\r\nAn Evaluative approach was used for this study. The research design used was Quasi\r\nexperimental non equivalent pre test and post test control group design. The conceptual\r\nframework of the study was based on the “Modified Ludwig Von Bertlanffy System theory\r\n(1968). Non probability purposive sampling method was used to select 60 samples for the\r\nstudy. 30 samples were in experimental group was selected from S.R.C diabetes care centre\r\nErode and 30 samples were in control group was selected from Monika diabetes care centre\r\nErode. The tool used for this study was Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Signs and\r\nSymptoms Scale to assess the level of pain and Sleep Scale from medical outcome of study\r\nto assess the level of sleep, exercises was given to the patients with diabetic peripheral\r\nneuropathy for 30 minutes once in a day for a period of 15 days in experimental group.\r\nThe data gathered were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics. The\r\nmean post test level of pain in experimental group 9.6(SD±3.15) was significantly lower\r\nthan the mean posttest level of pain in control group 15.9(SD±2.99) The mean difference\r\nwas 6.3.The Independent‘t’ value was 8.51which was significant at p<0.05 level. The mean\r\npost test scores of sleep in experimental group 47.7 (SD±5.56) was significantly higher than\r\nthe mean post test scores of sleep in control group 34.2(SD±7.03). The mean difference was\r\n13.5.The independent‘t’ value was 8.88which was significant at p<0.05 level. The mean\r\npost test scores of pain and sleep among patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in\r\nexperimental group were 9.6(SD±3.15) and 47.7 (SD±5.56) respectively. The mean\r\ndifference was 38.1. The ‘r’ value was -0.9 which showed that negative relationship\r\nbetween pain and sleep scores among patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in\r\nexperimental group. It reveals that as the pain level decreases sleep pattern was improved.\r\nThe study findings revealed that there was a significant association between post test\r\nlevel of pain among patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy with demographic\r\nvariables of marital status(χ2=7.74), family monthly income(χ2=9.65), and duration of\r\ntreatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy(χ2=7.66) at p<0.05 level of significance and no\r\nsignificant association between post test level of sleep score in experimental group. There is\r\na decreased level of pain and improvement in the level of sleep pattern among patients with\r\ndiabetic peripheral neuropathy after exercises. The study findings revealed that practicing\r\nexercises is beneficial for patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy for decreasing pain\r\nand improving sleep pattern.",

They may also be divided into motor, vocal, or visual stereotypies. Biological mechanisms of stereotypies are unknown but they seem to be related to the basal ganglia or the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits. Stereotypies are frequently found in patients with autistic disorders, intellectual disability, and sensorial deficit disorders. Some neurodevelopmental disorders show specific motor stereotypies, which reinforce the notion of a genetic or neurobiological basis. When necessary, treatment may include behavioral or drug-based approaches.",

Cognitive decline, seizures including myoclonus, vision loss and ataxia are the commonly described manifestations of this illness. While visual failure in this disease is largely attributed to retinal, macular degeneration and optic atrophy, with this index case, we report an atypical presentation in the form of higher order visual dysfunction. The pattern of cognitive regression has further been explored here with higher order visual dysfunction and language regression being the predominant manifestations, stemming from an involvement of bilateral occipitoparietal/occipitotemporal networks. Yet another unique feature of this case also lies in the occurrence of myoclonic-atonic seizure, a semiology rarely reported before in PME.",

      "title": "From mechanisms to future therapy: a synopsis of isolated REM sleep behavior disorder as early synuclein-related disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy are synucleinopathies, characterized by neuronal loss, gliosis and the abnormal deposition of α-synuclein in vulnerable areas of the nervous system. Neurodegeneration begins however several years before clinical onset of motor, cognitive or autonomic symptoms. The isolated form of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), a parasomnia with dream enactment behaviors and excessive muscle activity during REM sleep, is an early stage synucleinopathy. The neurophysiological hallmark of RBD is REM sleep without atonia (RWSA), i.e. the loss of physiological muscle atonia during REM sleep. RBD pathophysiology is not fully clarified yet, but clinical and basic science suggest that ɑ-syn pathology begins in the lower brainstem where REM atonia circuits are located, including the sublaterodorsal tegmental/subcoeruleus nucleus and the ventral medulla, then propagates rostrally to brain regions such as the substantia nigra, limbic system, cortex. Genetically, there is only a partial overlap between RBD, PD and DLB, and individuals with iRBD may represent a specific subpopulation. A genome-wide association study identified five loci, which all seem to revolve around the GBA1 pathway. iRBD patients often show subtle motor, cognitive, autonomic and/or sensory signs, neuroimaging alterations as well as biofluid and tissue markers of neurodegeneration (in particular pathologic α-synuclein aggregates), which can be useful for risk stratification. Patients with iRBD represent thus the ideal population for neuroprotective/neuromodulating trials. This review provides insights into these aspects, highlighting and substantiating the central role of iRBD in treatment development strategies for synucleinopathies.",

The clinico-pathological features were: (1) progressive dementia with insidious onset, mostly in the presenile period: (2) neurogenic muscular wasting in the course of illness (ALS- or SPMA-like symptoms); (3) duration from the onset of the illness to death: 2-5 years (average 30.6 months); (4) extrapyramidal symptoms and definite sensory deficits are less commonly present; (5) no characteristic abnormalities in the CSF or EEG; (6) no known consanguinity or familial occurrence; (7) non-specific mild to moderate degenerative changes in the fronto-temporal cerebral cortex, hypoglossal nuclei and spinal cord, and frequently in the substantia nigra. The author was interested in discovering whether the frequency and topology of lesions in the brain of patients with presenile dementia and motor neuron disease differed characteristically from the distribution found in cases of Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or progressive subcortical gliosis. Presenile dementia with motor neuron disease might be a new disease entity.",

Injury to the dorsiflexors or to any point along the neural pathways that supply these muscles can result in a foot drop. Injury to the peroneal nerve is usually the major precipitant. Other causes vary from trauma to surgical nerve injury, as well as leg compartment syndromes or dorsiflexor injuries, peripheral nerve injuries, stroke, neuropathies, drug toxicities, spinal stenosis, L5 sciaticas, systemic diseases such as connective tissue diseases, vasculidities, or diabetes. This report focuses on a patient presenting with a foot drop as an unusual manifestation of brain metastasis. His minimal symptomatology seemed to point towards a local process. Therefore, early recognition and prompt treatment are essential. The central nervous system must be the target of investigations when the workup fails to disclose the proper etiology. Potential diagnostic delays may occur. Certain cases may require a more aggressive approach.",

      "abstract": "Vascular dysregulation refers to the regulation of blood flow that is not adapted to the needs of the respective tissue. We distinguish primary vascular dysregulation (PVD, formerly called vasospastic syndrome) and secondary vascular dysregulation (SVD). Subjects with PVD tend to have cold extremities, low blood pressure, reduced feeling of thirst, altered drug sensitivity, increased pain sensitivity, prolonged sleep onset time, altered gene expression in the lymphocytes, signs of oxidative stress, slightly increased endothelin-1 plasma level, low body mass index and often diffuse and fluctuating visual field defects. Coldness, emotional or mechanical stress and starving can provoke symptoms. Virtually all organs, particularly the eye, can be involved. In subjects with PVD, retinal vessels are stiffer and more irregular, and both neurovascular coupling and autoregulation capacity are reduced while retinal venous pressure is often increased. Subjects with PVD have increased risk for normal-tension glaucoma, optic nerve compartment syndrome, central serous choroidopathy, Susac syndrome, retinal artery and vein occlusions and anterior ischaemic neuropathy without atherosclerosis. Further characteristics are their weaker blood–brain and blood-retinal barriers and the higher prevalence of optic disc haemorrhages and activated astrocytes. Subjects with PVD tend to suffer more often from tinnitus, muscle cramps, migraine with aura and silent myocardial ischaemic and are at greater risk for altitude sickness. While the main cause of vascular dysregulation is vascular endotheliopathy, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system is also involved. In contrast, SVD occurs in the context of other diseases such as multiple sclerosis, retrobulbar neuritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia and giant cell arteritis. Taking into consideration the high prevalence of PVD in the population and potentially linked pathologies, in the current article, the authors provide recommendations on how to effectively promote the field in order to create innovative diagnostic tools to predict the pathology and develop more efficient treatment approaches tailored to the person.",

      "abstract": "Premature survivors are at increased risk for impaired neurodevelopmental outcome compared to full terms. These sequelae include cognitive abnormalities, mild fine or gross motor delay, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing losses, impairment increases with decreasing gestational age. Persistence of multiple abnormal neurologic signs in the first 12 to 18 months is ominous. Emergence of other findings (vision impairments, seizures, feeding issues delay of head growth) is associated with poor outcome. MRI is useful in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome at the equivalent of term gestation. Other neonatal complications as; bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, poor growth, presence of congenital anomalies are associated with an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Premature survivors are more likely to have specific psychological and behavioral problems including attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, general anxiety, and depression. Individuals with birth weights below 1500 g are at greater risk for poor academic performance than those born with normal birthweight because of their impaired cognition, neurosensory defects, and behavioral and psychological problems. Neurodevelopmental outcome is assessed more accurately at school age than in early childhood due to the cognitive recovery over time and lack of accurate predictive assessment tools in early childhood. Survivors of prematures need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental impairment and, if impairment is present, be referred to educational programs and subspecialty care in order to provide the best possible outcome. ELBW infants without evidence of significant neonatal brain injury can recover when exposed to a nurturing home environment and comprehensive early intervention services.",

      "title": "A window into the mind-brain-body interplay: Development of diagnostic, prognostic biomarkers, and rehabilitation strategies in functional motor disorders",
      "abstract": "Background and aims Functional motor disorders (FMD) present a prevalent, yet misunderstood spectrum of neurological conditions characterized by abnormal movements (i.e., functional limb weakness, tremor, dystonia, gait impairments), leading to substantial disability and diminished quality of life. Despite their high prevalence, FMD often face delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment, resulting in significant social and economic burdens. The old concept of psychological factors as the primary cause (conversion disorder) has been abandoned due to the need for more evidence about their causal role. According to a predictive coding account, the emerging idea is that symptoms and disability may depend on dysfunctions of a specific neural system integrating interoception, exteroception, and motor control. Consequently, symptoms are construed as perceptions of the body’s state. Besides the main pathophysiological features (abnormal attentional focus, beliefs/expectations, and sense of agency), the lived experience of symptoms and their resulting disability may depend on an altered integration at the neural level of interoception, exteroception, and motor control. Methods and materials Our proposal aims to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of FMD through a three-stage research approach. Initially, a large cohort study will collect behavioral, neurophysiological, and MRI biomarkers from patients with FMD and healthy controls, employing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to develop a diagnostic algorithm. Subsequently, validation will occur using patients with organic motor disorders. Finally, the algorithm’s prognostic value will be explored post-rehabilitation in one subgroup of patients with FMD. Results Data collection for the present study started in May 2023, and by May 2025, data collection will conclude. Discussion Our approach seeks to enhance early diagnosis and prognostication, improve FMD management, and reduce associated disability and socio-economic costs by identifying disease-specific biomarkers.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organs with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Neuropsychiatric manifestation (NPSLE) is present among 28–40% of the SLE patients. Psychosis is rarely the only initial symptom of lupus, as neuropsychiatric lupus is often associated with systemic activity. We present two cases of young ladies presenting with acute psychosis as the predominant symptom and further diagnosed with SLE disease. Case reports: Case 1 A 20-year-old female, unmarried, presented to the Psychology Department with acute behavioral abnormality associated with staring, insomnia and, aggressive behavior, hearing voices for the last 3 days. No other psychiatric or neurological symptoms; she was taking 20 mg oral prednisolone prescribed according to a history of fatigue, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, pain in almost all joints, and myalgia for the last 1 month. There was no sign of focal neurological deficit or meningeal irritation. Examination of other systems did not find any clinical abnormality except for the presence of photosensitivity. A psychiatric consultation was ordered. Laboratory tests: white blood cells 3200 cell/mm 3 (range=4000–11 000) with normal differentiation, hemoglobin 9.2 mg/dl (range=12.5–16), platelet 90 000/dl (range=150 000–400 000), C-reactive protein (CRP) 65 mg/l ( n ≤6), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 100 mm/h(range=0–20). anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) profile which was positive in 1:320 dilution, homogenous type, along with anti-ds-DNA positive (+), decreased C3 and C4. The diagnosis of SLE was done according to the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria (EULAR/ACR Criteria). Case2 A 37-year-old married female with 3 children presented to the Psychology Department with disorientation, staring, hearing voices, seeing images of people who want to hurt her, refusing to respond to people, and insomnia for the last 10 days. She had complained of fatigue and low-grade fever for last month. A psychiatric consultation was ordered, and the patient was managed with an injection of haloperidol 5 mg BD. Laboratory tests: white blood cells 7300 cells/mm 3 (range=4000–11 000) with normal differentiation, hemoglobin 8.7 mg/dl (range=12.5–16), platelet 90 000/dl (range=150 000–400 000), reticulocyte:1.4, CRP 7 mg/l ( n ≤6), and ESR 50mm/h (range=0–20). The ANA profile was positive in 1:320 dilution, homogenous type, along with the anti-ds-DNA negative (−), decreased C3, and normal C4. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a high white matter signal around the lateral ventricles and in the semi-oval centers. Mild dilation of the lateral ventricles and slight elevation of the left insular and medial temporal lobe signal. Conclusion: Our case reports showed that organic disorders should be considered while evaluating acute psychosis, especially autoimmune disorders. The presence of laboratory features like anemia, elevated ESR, and elevated CRP should be taken with utmost importance.",

      "abstract": "Mental disorders accompanying digestive system diseases constitute interdisciplinary yet scarcely acknowledged both diagnostic and therapeutic problem. One of the mostly recognized examples is coeliac disease where patients endure the large spectrum of psychopathological symptoms, starting with attention deficit all the way down to the intellectual disability in extreme cases. It has not been fully explained how the pathomechanism of digestive system diseases affects patient's mental health, however one of the hypothesis suggests that it is due to serotonergic or opioid neurotransmission imbalance caused by gluten and gluten metabolites effect on central nervous system. Behavioral changes can also be invoked by liver or pancreatic diseases, which causes life-threatening abnormalities within a brain. It occurs that these abnormalities reflexively exacerbate the symptoms of primary somatic disease and aggravate its course, which worsens prognosis. The dominant mental disease mentioned in this article is depression which because of its effect on a hypothalamuspituitary- adrenal axis and on an autonomic nervous system, not only aggravates the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases but may accelerate their onset in genetically predisposed patients. Depression is known to negatively affects patients' ability to function in a society and a quality of their lives. Moreover, as far as children are concerned, the occurrence of digestive system diseases accompanied by mental disorders, may adversely affect their further physical and psychological development, which merely results in worse school performance. All those aspects of mental disorders indicate the desirability of the psychological care for patients with recognized digestive system disease. The psychological assistance should be provided immediately after diagnosis of a primary disease and be continued throughout the whole course of treatment.",

RBD occurs in approximately 0.5% of the general population, with a higher prevalence in older men. RBD is a frequent feature of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), but is only rarely reported in Alzheimer's disease. RBD is also a risk factor for α-synuclein-related diseases, such as DLB, Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy. Therefore, RBD has major implications for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and for understanding specific neurodegeneration patterns. Several markers of neurodegeneration have been identified in RBD, including cognitive impairments such as deficits in attention, executive functions, learning capacities, and visuospatial abilities. Approximately 50% of RBD patients present mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, RBD is also associated with cognitive decline in PD.",

It is caused by damage to the ventral part of the brainstem, often resulting from vascular events. The syndrome is devastating, as patients are fully conscious but unable to communicate verbally or move any body part except for vertical eye movements and blinking. LIS can be classified into subtypes based on the extent of motor involvement, including classic, incomplete, total, and total with anarthria. Diagnosis is challenging but relies on clinical presentation and neuroimaging studies. Differential diagnosis is essential to distinguish LIS from similar conditions with altered consciousness. Prognosis varies depending on the underlying cause, with younger age associated with better outcomes at the onset. Rehabilitation can improve motor function and communication capabilities, leading to a higher quality of life for LIS patients. Early recognition and accurate diagnosis are crucial for implementing appropriate management strategies and improving patient outcomes. Further research is needed to explore therapeutic interventions for enhancing recovery and functional independence in LIS patients.",

      "abstract": "The management of a patient with epilepsy requires the physician to address himself to two basic tasks: (1) an accurate diagnosis must be made with special attention to the possibility of progressive intracranial disease; and (2) an effective regimen for control of the seizures must be devised. DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGE Seizures beginning in infancy are accompanied, in about half of cases, by other evidence of cerebral damage, especially mental subnormality. The precise pathology often cannot be determined during life, although a cerebral developmental defect or birth injury is usually responsible. In a small proportion of cases a metabolic error, subdural hematoma, neuronal degenerative disease, or some other progressive process will be revealed by a history of deterioration in skills previously acquired. The diagnosis can then be established by other characteristic signs of the condition under consideration and appropriate laboratory studies. Grand mal, focal seizures and minor motor seizures are the types usually encountered in infancy. The same factors which commonly cause seizures in infancy continue to initiate seizures in childhood and early adolescence, but to a steadily decreasing extent. Thus, seizures due to a birth injury, like most post-traumatic seizures, usually begin within 24 months after the traumatic incident1; however, they may be delayed until late childhood or adolescence. Seizures appearing as a sequela of meningitis or other infections are sometimes similarly delayed. After the second year of life, seizures of unknown cause rapidly increase in incidence, including cases of so-called genetic epilepsy. In the latter, centrencephalic seizure bursts (3/sec wave and spike discharges) appear diffusely in the EEG, not only in patients, but in 45% of their asymptomatic siblings (aged 4 to 16 years), as well.",

Although a mixed Alzheimer/vascular picture is common, gradual onset of multiple cognitive deficits is typical of AD, while abrupt onset, a fluctuating course, hypertension, and focal neurologic signs suggest vascular dementia, in Lewy-body dementia, memory loss may not be an early feature, and fluctuation can be marked by distressing psychotic symptoms and behavioral disturbance, investigations should be minimally invasive and relatively cheap, confined to routine blood tests, chest x-ray and/or electrocardiogram if clinically indicated, cardiologie or neurologic referral in the presence of cerebrovascular signs, and computed tomography if an intracranial lesion is suspected.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th Edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association 2013) presents current criteria for major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies and their applications in clinical practice. In this chapter, these conditions will be collectively referred to as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) when the cognitive-behavioral symptoms are the initial presentation and as Parkinson's disease (PD) or Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) if the movement disorder is the initial presentation and substantially precedes cognitive-behavioral symptoms. The underlying pathological lesion in these disorders is the intracellular aggregation of α -synuclein. Aggregates of α -synuclein are present in neurons as neocortical Lewy bodies and dystrophic Lewy neurons in DLB, PD, and PDD, or as cytoplasmic inclusions in oligodendrocytes in less common Lewy body disorders such as multiple system atrophy. However, α -synuclein pathology can be present in many other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (Table 21–1 ). The Lewy body disorders are broadly characterized by variable degrees of progressive decline in cognitive, motor, behavioral, and autonomic function.

      "abstract": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by prolonged impairment of consciousness of variable entity, often associated with myoclonias or automatisms. EEG shows continuous paroxysmal activity or electrographic discharges. When NCSE occurs in older patients, differential diagnosis with other conditions such as stroke or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, may be difficult and a high degree of suspicion is required. Emergency EEG represents the most important means of investigation in such cases. According to ictal EEG, NCSE may be classified as generalized (including typical and “de novo” absence status) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Absence status, or ‘petit mal’ status, is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It can occur in the context of different types of generalized idiopathic epilepsies, or ‘de novo’, with onset usually in the elderly, precipitated by toxic or metabolic factors in subjects with no previous history of epilepsy [1]. Ictal EEG shows continuous or almost continuous generalized spike and polyspike and wave discharges. Clinical and EEG normalization occurs after i.v. benzodiazepines (BDZ) in most cases. The prognosis of “de novo” absence status is generally good and recurrences are rare [1]. In CPSE, impairment of consciousness may be continuous or fluctuating, but it is usually clinically very difficult to distinguish from absence status. CPSE may occur in patients with preexisting epilepsy, at times precipitated by AEDs withdrawal, or in subjects with acute or remote cerebral lesions. Ictal EEG shows continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. CPSE tends to recur and may be difficult to treat (response to i.v. BDZ in ~ 60% of patients) [2]. Cognitive and behavioral sequelae have been rarely reported, thus prompting an early recognition and treatment of such a condition. Mortality is also rare, mostly depending on etiology, but may reach up to 26,3% in the elderly. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively [3].",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a major health problem. Several studies suggest a significant influence of epilepsy and its treatment on dynamic and functional properties of brain activity. Epilepsy can adversely affect mental development, cognition, and behavior. Epileptic patients may experience reduced intelligence, attention, and problems in memory, language, and frontal executive functions. Neuropsychological, functional, and quantitative neuroimaging studies revealed that epilepsy affect the brain as a whole. Mechanisms of epilepsy‐related cognitive dysfunction are poorly delineated. Cognitive deficits with epilepsy may be transient, persistent, or progressive. Transient disruption of cognitive encoding processes may occur with paroxysmal focal or generalized epileptic discharges, whereas epileptogenesis‐related neuronal plasticity, reorganization, sprouting, and impairment of cellular metabolism are fundamental determinants for progressive cognitive deterioration. Also antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have differential, reversible, and sometimes cumulative cognitive adverse consequences. AEDs not only reduce neuronal irritability but also may impair neuronal excitability, neurotransmitter release, enzymes, and factors critical for information processing and memory. The present article serves as an overview of recent studies in adult and childhood epilepsy literatures present in PubMed that highlighted cognitive evaluation in epilepsy field (publications till 2008 were checked). We also checked the reference lists of the retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies, in addition to our experience in this field. Our search revealed that although the aspects of cognitive dysfunction, risk factors, and consequences have been explored in many studies; however, the mechanisms of contribution of epilepsy‐related variables, including AEDs, to patients' cognition are largely unexplored. In this review, we discussed the differential effect of AEDs in mature and immature brains and the known mechanisms underlying epilepsy and AEDs adverse effects on cognition. The nature, timing, course, and mechanisms of cognitive alteration with epilepsy and its medications are of considerable clinical and research implications.",

      "abstract": "Background: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a rare inherited mitochondrial disease that leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in optic nerve damage and vision loss. Systemic involvement has been reported in several LHON cases, referred to as LHON+ disorders. However, the causes and presentations of such conditions have been poorly studied. It is suggested that 90% of mitochondrial dysfunction is caused by one of three primary point mutations in mitochondrial DNA that affect respiratory complex I (referred to as mtDNA LHON), with unresolved cases of LHON being caused by other variants, known as autosomal recessive LHON. The cardiac, musculoskeletal, neurological, and auditory systems are commonly affected in LHON. For example, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death have been linked to specific mutations. Neurological effects &amp;ndash; such as dystonia, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, and ataxia &amp;ndash; as well as hearing loss, have also been observed in patients with specific mitochondrial mutations. These findings highlight the need for a more comprehensive evaluation beyond standard ophthalmic assessments. LHON is typically diagnosed based on a combination of ophthalmic imaging, patient age and gender, clinical course (bilateral, rapidly progressive, and sequential visual loss), family history, maternal inheritance, and fundus appearance. However, the advent of genetic testing has significantly expanded the recognized phenotype. In terms of treatment, idebenone is the only FDA-approved therapy for LHON; however, intravitreal gene therapy yields promising improvement, especially for the most common m.11778G&gt;A mutation, which accounts for 70% of causative mutations. At present, these therapies are confined to ocular treatment. Objective: This review highlights the importance of recognizing systemic manifestations of LHON, which are frequently overlooked in clinical practice. Conclusion: Early detection of these systemic manifestations, especially in cardiac and neurological systems, could help with prompt intervention and improve patient outcomes. Further research into gene therapy and mitochondrial replacement techniques holds promising potential for developing more effective treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, currently incurable, and devastating syndrome. Although sleep disturbances are not primary symptoms of schizophrenia, they are important aspects of schizophrenia. Difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep are frequently encountered in patients with schizophrenia. Many schizophrenics report low subjective sleep quality. Measured by polysomnography, increased sleep latency as well as reduced total sleep time, sleep efficiency, slow wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep latency (REM latency), are found in most patients with schizophrenia and appear to be an important aspect of the pathophysiology of this disorder. Some literatures suggest that worsening sleep quality precedes schizophrenic exacerbations. Co-morbid sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless legs syndrome (RLS), and sleep-disrupting behaviors associated with schizophrenia may lead to sleep disturbances. Clinicians should screen the patient with sleep complaints for primary sleep disorders like OSA and RLS, and carefully evaluate sleep hygiene behaviors of all patients with schizophrenia who complain of sleep disturbances.",

Based on twenty‐two cases, 2.5–48 years old, we describe the neurological features and evolution. In the neonatal and infantile age there was hypotonia, muscular weakness, developmental retardation, diminishing tendon reflexes and alternating esotropia. Preschool and early school age was characteristized by progressive polyneuropathy with muscular weakness and contractures, extrapyramidal signs (ataxia, dyskinesia, dysequilibrium), psychomotor retardation (I.Q. level of 40–60), transient stroke‐like episodes and retinitis pigmentosa. In puberty and adulthood the condition was rather stationary. They learned at best to walk with support, understand the spoken word well, and a few developed a fairly good linguistic skill. The dominating neuroradiological finding was pontine and cerebellar “atrophy”.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Although delirium is well known to acute care clinicians, the features required for its diagnosis and how to understand and operationalize them remain sticking points in the field. To clarify the delirium phenotype, we present a close reading of past and current sets of delirium diagnostic criteria. Methods We first differentiate the delirium syndrome ( i.e. , features evaluated at bedside) from additional criteria required for diagnosis. Next, we align related features across diagnostic systems and examine them in context to determine intent. Where criteria are ambiguous, we review common delirium instruments to illustrate how they have been interpreted. Results An acute disturbance in attention is universally attested across diagnostic systems. A second core feature denotes confusion and has been included across systems as disturbance in awareness, impaired consciousness, and thought disorganization. This feature may be better understood as a disturbance in thought clarity and operationalized in terms of neuropsychological domains thereby clearly linking it to global neurocognitive disturbance. Altered level of activity describes a third core feature, including motor and sleep/wake cycle disturbances. Excluding stupor (wherein mental content cannot be assessed due to reduced arousal) from delirium, as in DSM‐5‐TR, is appropriate for a psychiatric diagnosis, but the brain injury exclusion in ICD‐11 is unjustified. Conclusions The delirium phenotype involves a disturbance in attention, qualitative thought clarity, and quantitative activity level, including in relation to expected sleep/wake cycles. Future diagnostic systems should include a severity threshold and specify that delirium diagnosis refers to a 24‐h period.",

A variety of medical and psychiatric factors may also produce marked sleep disruption. All of these factors are in this chapter. A recent randomised double-masked placebo-controlled trial in children with neurodevelopmental disorders showed that melatonin reduced sleep onset latency but at the same time was associated with earlier waking time than placebo. Melatonin is not generally considered to produce tolerance, rebound insomnia or dependency, problems often associated with other sedative hypnotics. The chapter explains the use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. The misalignment of the internal sleep-wake circadian clock with environmental day/night patterns and other environmental cues may also result in sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Children born very preterm are at a greater risk of abnormal visual and neurological development when compared to children born at full term. Preterm birth is associated with retinopathy of prematurity (a proliferative retinal vascular disease) and can also affect the development of brain structures associated with post‐retinal processing of visual information. Visual deficits common in children born preterm, such as reduced visual acuity, strabismus, abnormal stereopsis and refractive error, are likely to be detected through childhood vision screening programs, ophthalmological follow‐up or optometric care. However, routine screening may not detect other vision problems, such as reduced visual fields, impaired contrast sensitivity and deficits in cortical visual processing, that may occur in children born preterm. For example, visual functions associated with the dorsal visual processing stream, such as global motion perception and visuomotor integration, may be impaired by preterm birth. These impairments can continue into adolescence and adulthood and may contribute to the difficulties in learning (particularly reading and mathematics), attention, behaviour and cognition that some children born preterm experience. Improvements in understanding the mechanisms by which preterm birth affects vision will inform future screening and interventions for children born preterm.",

Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death.

Desde hace aproximadamente un año, el paciente refiere percepciones visuales de pequeños animales (“bichos”) que asocia con palomas o gallinas, así como sensaciones táctiles compatibles con formicación. Estas percepciones son interpretadas como infestación corporal, llegando a relacionarlas con la ingesta alimentaria o vía nasal. No se evidencian lesiones dérmicas ni signos objetivos de infestación. El uso de insecticida ha sido reforzador de la convicción delirante. La sintomatología se presenta en el contexto de pérdida visual severa, sin evidencia de psicosis activa ni trastorno del ánimo mayor, aunque se detecta componente afectivo reactivo vinculado al duelo prolongado por fallecimiento de su esposa. Se han considerado dos entidades clínicas como principales diagnósticos diferenciales: el síndrome de Charles Bonnet (alucinaciones visuales complejas secundarias a déficit visual, sin ideación delirante estructurada)1 y el síndrome de Ekbom o delirio de parasitosis (trastorno delirante somático caracterizado por creencia firme de infestación, frecuentemente acompañado de alucinaciones táctiles)2. Dado el contenido delirante persistente, la falta de crítica y la asociación con conductas compensatorias (uso de insecticida), el cuadro clínico se orienta hacia un síndrome de Ekbom con posible base sensorial y afectiva. Se recomienda intervención interdisciplinar con Psiquiatría para valorar inicio de tratamiento antipsicótico a dosis ajustadas a edad y comorbilidad, revisión de tratamiento psicotrópico (trazodona, zolpidem) y activación de redes de apoyo social. Este caso ilustra la complejidad diagnóstica de los trastornos perceptivos en el adulto mayor, así como la interacción entre déficits sensoriales, factores afectivos y creencias delirantes en el contexto geriátrico5.",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common sensorimotor disorder that may be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to a diverse group of conditions. The pathophysiology of primary RLS is only partly understood, but a strong association with brain iron deficiency possibly resulting in impaired dopaminergic function has been recognized. Genomic studies have established a genetic basis for primary RLS as well, and at least 42% of people with primary RLS possess a first-degree relative with the disorder. Secondary RLS is often associated with renal insufficiency, pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia, diabetic neuropathy, and Parkinson's disease. Approximately one-fourth of pregnant women experience RLS, with more intense symptoms experienced during the third trimester, and resolution of symptoms typically occurring within a few months after delivery, though RLS may resolve as early as 2 weeks after delivery. Restless legs syndrome is associated with increased prevalence of mood disturbances, sleep disturbances, and an impaired quality of life. The diagnosis of RLS involves 4 essential criteria related to a compelling urge to move the legs with an accompanying unpleasant sensation in the legs that is worse in the evening and at rest and improved by movement. Treatment of RLS incorporates both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Dopamine agonists are the mainstay of RLS treatment, but other therapies, including gabapentin, benzodiazepines, and low-potency opioids, are also commonly employed.",

      "title": "SENSORY NEURONOPATHIES",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND- Sensory neuronopathies are caused by impairment in the function or disturbance in the structure of the unipolar sensory neurons that reside in the spinal dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. Their vulnerability to pathogenic factors, such as immune effectors, toxins, and infections, may stem from lack of an effective blood-nerve barrier in the dorsal root ganglia. REVIEW SUMMARY- Patients typically present with profound, often asymmetric proprioceptive and vibratory sensory loss with ataxia and variable degrees of pain. Muscle stretch reflexes are absent. Strength is remarkably preserved. The mode of onset may be acute, subacute, or chronic. Supportive electrophysiological features are reduced or absent sensory potentials in the setting of essentially normal motor responses. Recognized causes comprise a paraneoplastic disorder (anti-Hu antibody positive); Sjögren's syndrome; an idiopathic form (probably immune-mediated in most patients); and toxic, nutritional, and infectious disorders. Sural nerve biopsies in patients with sensory neuronopathy show loss of large myelinated fibers. The clinical course is variable, ranging between relentless progression and stabilization with functional recovery. Treatments for the paraneoplastic and immune-mediated disorders comprise corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and various immunosuppressive agents, but they have generally not met with success. CONCLUSION- Sensory neuronopathies are an important group of disorders that may be early warning signals of a systemic illness or disease process such as an occult neoplasm, autoimmune disease, nutritional deficiency, or unrecognized toxic exposure. The differential diagnosis extends across a broad spectrum of conditions that target the distal and peripheral processes of the dorsal root ganglion neuron. Although most sensory neuronopathies have responded poorly to treatment, prompt recognition is important because treatment begun in the earliest stages might stem the further loss of sensory neurons.",

      "abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness that has protean neurologic manifestations involving both the central and peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system manifestations of Lyme borreliosis can be divided chronologically into acute and chronic forms. Within weeks after disease onset, approximately 15% of untreated patients develop an acute Lyme meningoradiculoneuritis with headache, fever, radicular pain, weakness, and sensory loss, often associated with cranial neuropathy, usually facial palsy. Cerebrospinal fluid typically shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, high protein, and normal glucose. Diagnosis is made by recognition of characteristic clinical features with a history of preceding exposure and confirmed by serologic evidence of exposure to B. burgdorferi or by antibody or PCR evidence of cerebrospinal fluid infection. Months to years after onset, rare patients may develop chronic polyradiculoneuropathy presenting with sensory symptoms or radicular pain. Diagnosis is confirmed by a history of exposure, previous systemic or acute neurologic manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, and serologic evidence of infection. Pathology of acute or chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathy reveals axonal degeneration with perivascular mononuclear infiltration. Eradication of the organism can be achieved with 2 to 4 weeks of ceftriaxone for both acute and chronic Lyme neuroborreliosis. Isolated facial palsy without evidence of cerebrospinal fluid infection can be treated with oral antibiotics such as doxycycline. Prognosis after therapy is good, but neurologic recovery is slower for chronic than acute Lyme radiculoneuropathy.",

      "title": "Mild Parkinsonian signs: An overview of an emerging concept",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mild Parkinsonian signs (MPS) include gait and balance changes, rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. MPS can occur commonly during the clinical examination of older people who do not have known neurological disease, with prevalence estimates for MPS as a whole ranging from 15% to 95%. MPS are generally progressive and they are coupled with functional difficulties, impaired gait and balance, and increased risks of mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and mortality. The mechanistic basis for these signs is unclear, but is likely to be multifactorial, with possible factors including an age‐associated decline in dopaminergic nigrostriatal activity, the early development of neurodegenerative (Lewy body or Alzheimer's type) pathologies in the basal ganglia, or the accumulation of vascular pathology in the brain. It would be valuable to identify those individuals with MPS who are at increased risk for the development of future Alzheimer's disease, full‐blown Parkinson's disease, or strokes, and to develop therapeutic strategies to intervene to lessen the likelihood of MPS‐related morbidity and mortality. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society",

      "title": "Structural brain changes, cognitive deficits and visual hallucinations in dementia with lewy bodies and parkinson's disease with dementia",
      "abstract": "La enfermedad de Parkinson (EP), la enfermedad de Parkinson con Demencia (EPD) y la Demencia con Cuerpos de Lewy (DCL) presentan una alteracion del metabolismo de la alfa-sinucleina que provoca la formacion de agregados proteicos llamados Cuerpos de Lewy. Las sinucleinopatias son la segunda causa de demencia degenerativa despues de la enfermedad de Alzheimer. Se caracterizan neuropatologicamente por inclusiones de alfa-sinucleina en el tronco cerebral, nucleos subcorticales, areas neocorticales y limbicas, y clinicamente por demencia, alteraciones atencionales, parkinsonismo y comunmente alucinaciones visuales.Dado que la DCL y la EPD presentan un solapamiento clinico, se ha argumentado que pueden representar la misma enfermedad. La DCL se diagnostica cuando la demencia ocurre antes o de manera paralela al parkinsonismo, mientras que el termino EPD es usado para describir la demencia que ocurre en el contexto de una EP bien establecida.La presente tesis doctoral consta de dos estudios los objetivos de los cuales fueron establecer las diferencias en sustancia gris cerebral entre DCL y EPD mediante la tecnica de analisis voxel-based morphometry aplicada a imagenes de resonancia magnetica potenciada en T1, asi como determinar las diferencias en perfil cognitivo en estos grupos de pacientes. Asimismo, en el primer estudio, se evaluo la relacion entre las estructuras cerebrales y las funciones cognitivas en estos pacientes, y en el segundo estudio, se evaluaron los correlatos neuroanatomicos de las alucinaciones visuales, asi como su correlacion con el funcionamiento cognitivo en este grupo de pacientes.Para ello se estudiaron un total de 12 pacientes diagnosticados de DCL, 16 pacientes con EPD y 16 controles sanos apareados por edad y sexo, mediante una secuencia de RM 3D potenciada en T1 adquirida en un escaner de 1.5 Tesla y una evaluacion neuropsicologica y conductual.Las conclusiones que se derivan de este estudio son las siguientes:Los pacientes con DLC y EPD presentan un patron diferente de atrofia regional. En comparacion con los controles, los pacientes con EPD presentan mayor reduccion en areas parieto-occipitales y los pacientes con DCL en areas frontales, temporales y parietales. Ademas, los pacientes con DCL tienen una mayor perdida de sustancia gris que los EPD en diversas areas frontales, en concreto en las circunvoluciones frontal inferior, frontal superior y premotora.En los analisis individuales, los pacientes con DCL y los pacientes con EPD presentan una perdida de sustancia gris hipocampal bilateral, pero solo la frecuencia de la reduccion hipocampal derecha fue significativamente mayor en DCL que en EPD.La presencia de alucinaciones visuales se relaciona con una reduccion de la sustancia gris en regiones frontales en ambos grupos, pero en diferentes areas. En los pacientes con DCL en la circunvolucion frontal inferior y en la EPD en la region orbitofrontal. Asimismo, la severidad y frecuencia de las alucinaciones visuales correlaciona negativamente con el volumen de la circunvolucion frontal inferior y el precuneus.En el perfil atencional, los pacientes con DCL presentan mayor distractibilidad, caracterizada por menor vigilancia, mientras que los pacientes con EPD presentan mayor impulsividad, reflejada por errores intrusivos y perseverativos.En el grupo con DCL, el deficit de memoria visual se correlaciona con un decremento del volumen del area temporal medial derecha (hipocampo y amigdala) y los deficits atencionales correlacionan con una perdida del volumen del cingulado anterior, frontal inferior y prefrontal dorsolateral bilateralmente. En este mismo grupo, la presencia y severidad de las alucinaciones visuales se relaciona con una alteracion de la fluencia verbal semantica, del control inhibitorio de la atencion y de las funciones visuoperceptivas, mientras que en los pacientes con EPD se relaciona con deficits en memoria visual.La conclusion final, es que en los dos grupos con demencia, hay un patron de perdida de sustancia gris y un perfil cognitivo diferencial. Asimismo, cada patologia presenta un patron distinto de correlaciones entre sustancia gris y conducta.",

      "title": "Non-convulsive status epilepticus: a practical approach to diagnosis in confused older people",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) presents with minimal seizure activity clinically, but with evidence on EEG. It is a recognised cause of delirium in older people, but prevalence estimates vary widely. As delirium is a common presentation in older people and because NCSE is potentially reversible, an improved diagnostic ability in this group could be highly beneficial. EEG testing is required to make a definitive diagnosis, but this may be difficult due to access to testing, patient adherence and result interpretation. NCSE has two commonly recognised forms: complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE) and absence status epilepticus (ASE). Clinical features associated with NCSE in older people presenting with confusion include a reduction in level of arousal; aphasia or interrupted speech; myoclonus or subtle jerking; staring; automatisms; perseveration or echolalia; increased tone; nystagmus or eye deviation; emotional lability; disinhibition and anosagnosia. Risk factors include female sex, a history of epilepsy or a tonic–clonic seizure around the time of onset, and recent discontinuation of benzodiazepines. A practical approach to the diagnosis of NCSE in older people is suggested based upon the presence of clinical features suggestive of NCSE and local access to EEG testing.",

      "title": "Diagnostic Evaluation of Immune-Mediated Neuropathies",
      "abstract": "The peripheral nerves consist of bundles of long neuronal axons as they exit the central nervous system (CNS). Some peripheral nerves are wrapped in a myelin sheath generated by Schwann cells, whereas others are unmyelinated. Peripheral nerves serve different motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. The term peripheral neuropathy is usually used to describe symmetric and universal damage to adjacent nerves. The damage and clinical manifestations are usually located distally with a proximal progression. Several disorders can damage peripheral nerves and cause peripheral neuropathy; it is important to differentiate actual neuropathy from other disorders that can have a similar clinical presentation [1]. The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy necessitates a thorough workup of possible etiologies to identify immune-mediated causes that are amenable to immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. Importantly, patients may occasionally suffer from more than one disease-causing their peripheral neuropathy. Clinically relevant co-comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, chronic alcohol abuse, etc. need to be considered. Evidence-based guidelines and diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy have been published for specific neuropathic phenotypes such as distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy, small fiber neuropathy, or inflammatory neuropathies. However, they are only applicable for specific neuropathic conditions or when a specific diagnosis is already suspected on clinical grounds. By focusing on the initial steps of the diagnostic workup, this standard operating procedure provides a practical guideline including clinical and additional diagnostic parameters that help to identify the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy [2].",

      "title": "Neurogenic Positional Pedal Neuritis",
      "abstract": "Neurogenic positional pedal neuritis is a presentation of neuritic symptoms in one or both feet usually affected by body position, specifically, the position of the spine. Its etiology is similar to that of neurogenic-induced claudication caused by spinal stenosis in that the symptoms are caused by compression or irritation of nerves of the lower lumbosacral spine, usually the fifth lumbar and first sacral nerve roots. Burning, stabbing, a cold feeling, aching, numbness, paresthesia, or a weak or tired feeling of the feet (during some part of the disease process) depend on spinal position and may occur during standing, walking, or even lying in bed. Symptoms may be severe and are often eliminated by lumbosacral spine flexion, such as by walking with wheeled support such as a grocery cart or walker; less frequently by negative-heel shoe modification, which can change the position of the lumbosacral spine in stance; or by alteration of sleeping position. This condition, which can include loss of protective sensation, is often misdiagnosed as neuropathy (especially in diabetic patients) or less frequently as biomechanical in origin. In diabetic patients, this condition is frequently the cause of failure of monochromatic infrared energy therapy for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Treatment is aimed at reducing the spinal nerve or nerve root irritation. Clear definition of the pedal symptoms of spinal nerve compression within a single diagnostic category should facilitate identification and treatment. (J Am Podiatr Med Assoc 93(3): 174-184, 2003)",

      "abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic form, progressive and immune mediated central nervous system disorder that affects both adults and children. MS is characterized by the development of multiple lesions with the nerve fibers in the spinal cord, optic nerves and brain. Multiple sclerosis affects the approximately 2.5 million people worldwide. A triad of symptoms characterize the disease: fatigue, changes in sensation, ataxia, muscle weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, visual problems, chronic or acute pain, difficulties of bladder and bowel. The diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis is made on the foundation of the signs and symptoms, with magnetic resonance imaging and additional laboratory tests playing a helpful role. Every tests are non precise and simply supply supportive indication for diagnosis. A few people have a inadequate number of “relapses” or “attacks” and remain fairly healthy for decades, others may worsen rapidly from the time of analysis, through shortened lifespan and poor excellence of the life. The prognosis is problematical to forecast; it depends on the initial symptom, subtype of the illness, the individual patient’s disorder characteristics. The substantial variability in multiple sclerosis manifestations leads to elevated figure of misdiagnoses each year, but advances in knowledge and pharmaceuticals are leading to more exact identification and successful management. Early diagnosis and management is essential in reducing the severity of disease.",

      "title": "The role of negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia outcome",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness, with symptoms beginning in late adolescence/early adulthood and persisting throughout the rest of the patient's life. Positive psychotic symptoms may fluctuate during the course of the illness, but negative symptoms, especially primary negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction are relatively constant. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are both primary (associated with the illness) and secondary (due to depression, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism or acute psychosis). While secondary negative symptoms may be reduced by treating the causative agent, primary negative symptoms are viewed as enduring, persisting between psychotic episodes. Conventional antipsychotics treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but they have little effect on primary negative and cognitive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are often associated with poor premorbid function, the male sex, and low IQ (Intelligence Quotient). In addition, most studies find that negative symptoms are associated with a poor overall outcome. Several studies, including our own, have suggested that primary negative symptoms are functionally localized to the frontal and parietal cortices. These kinds of data raise the possibility that primary negative symptoms may have a pathophysiological basis distinct from positive psychosis. Cognitive impairment also appears to be a relatively independent aspect of schizophrenia. Impairment may be evident in a subtle form from early childhood, and often precedes the development of psychotic symptoms. Additional impairment accrues with the onset of psychotic illness with little evidence, in the vast majority of cases, of progression over the course of the illness. Cognitive impairment is only modestly related to psychotic symptom severity and type. However, the extent, and perhaps specific types of cognitive impairment, appear to be predictive of functional outcome.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To determine if Inflammatory diabetic neuropathy (IDN) can be differentiated from diabetic sensorimotor neuropathy (DPN) by clinical features, electrophysiological, pathological or laboratory tests. Background: IDN can overlap with DPN in clinical presentation and electrophysiological and laboratory tests. Design/Methods: A retrospective cohort of patients seen at the neuromuscular clinic of University of Nebraska Medical Center were reviewed. Suspected IDN cases were identified by a history of subacute onset and progressive sensory or motor neuropathy in diabetic patients. DPN cases were identified by the neuropathy being predominantly sensory with a gradual onset and remaining clinically stable or gradually worsening over time. The other causes of neuropathy were excluded. Results: IDN occurred earlier in diabetes mellitus, had higher prevalence of limb weakness, walking difficulty, and electrophysiological abnormalities suggesting demyelination and axonal loss (absence of motor responses in the lower limbs and sensory responses in the upper limbs). Sensory nerve biopsies in IDN showed perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, decreased fiber density, increased demyelination and axonal degeneration. Most IDN patients improved with immunotherapy. Conclusions: Features that favor IDN over DPN are limb weakness, more severe nerve conduction abnormalities suggestive of demyelination and axonal degeneration, inflammatory infiltrates on nerve biopsy and a favorable response to immunotherapy. A nerve biopsy can help establish an inflammatory cause. Disclosure: Dr. Thaisetthawatkul has nothing to disclose. Dr. Fernandes has nothing to disclose. Dr. Piccione has nothing to disclose.

Insomnia can be transient, short-term, or chronic in its presentation. Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related personal discomfort. Chronic insomnia can be caused by neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders starting or persisting during sleep that hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity. Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation. Agrypnia excitata (AE) is the term which aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome, whose pathogenetic mechanism consists in an intralimbic disconnection releasing the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation from corticolimbic control.",

      "title": "Review: Psychiatric Disorder and Cognitive Impairment in SLE",
      "abstract": "Poor performance on cognitive testing is common in SLE but it is not progressive in the majority of patients and may fluctuate or resolve without specific treatment. Cognitive impairment in patients without overt CNS-SLE may result from generalised disease activity or psychiatric disorder which reduce speed, concentration and motivation. This emphasises once again the importance of recognising and treating psychiatric disorder in these patients. Although mean cognitive scores are lower in SLE patients with overt CNS involvement than those without, an individual's cognitive score is a poor predictor of the presence of CNS involvement because of considerable overlap between groups. It has been suggested that the pattern of cognitive impairment, rather than simply whether it is present or absent, may be more helpful in identifying patients with CNS involvement but this requires further investigation in prospective studies. Cognitive impairment at one point in time is not predictive of future CNS events during 1 or 2 years of follow-up. Routine cognitive testing in SLE does not therefore appear to be helpful either for identifying patients with current CNS involvement or for identifying those at future risk of this complication. In the absence of double-blind randomised controlled trials, treatment of neuropsychiatric SLE is based on clinical experience and anecdotal case reports. Aggressive immunosuppression with high-dose corticosteroids in conjunction with either azathioprine or cyclophosphamide may be indicated in patients with life-threatening CNS-SLE but, on the basis of current evidence, is not justified in those with lone subtle cognitive abnormalities.",

      "abstract": "Dementia is a syndrome characterized by a decline of two or more cognitive functions, affecting social or professional life. Alzheimer’s Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that represents 53% of dementia cases; memory loss, inability to recognize faces, impaired judgement, disorientation and confusion are possible common symptoms. Vascular Dementia is responsible for 42% of dementia cases, due to cerebrovascular pathologies, and the clinical aspects are related to the extension and location of the brain injury. Lewy Bodies Dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder that represents 15% of dementia cases, and its symptoms include visual hallucinations, parkinsonism and fluctuating cognitive decline. Frontotemporal dementia is a group of clinical syndromes, divided in Behavioral-variant, characterized by disinhibition, compulsions, apathy, aberrant sexual behavior and executive dysfunction; and Primary Progressive Aphasia, which is subdivided in Nonfluentvariant and Semantic-variant. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a reversible cause of dementia, with a wide clinical feature, that includes psychiatric symptoms such as depression and irritability, hematological symptoms related to anemia (e.g. dyspnea and fatigue), and neurological symptoms including dementia and neuropathy. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is also reversible, presenting forgetfulness, changes in mood, decline of executive functions, reduced attention, and a lack of interest in daily activities as symptoms. The radiological findings vary depending on the etiology of dementia. For that reason, understanding neuroimaging and clinical aspects is important to diagnose effectively",

      "abstract": "Lewy body dementia is a common but frequently underdiagnosed cause of dementia often mistaken for the more familiar entity of Alzheimer disease. Clinically the distinction is important, because it can have profound implications for management.The medical literature was searched using the keywords \"Lewy bodies,\" \"Lewy body dementia,\" \"Alzheimer dementia,\" and \"parkinsonian disorders.\" A case of Lewy body dementia is described.An elderly man had long-standing diagnoses of Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. After he was evaluated thoroughly, the diagnosis was revised to Lewy body dementia, leading to changes in treatment that were associated with dramatic improvement in the patient's mental status. Evidence from the literature suggests that Lewy body dementia can be diagnosed in primary care settings based on clinical criteria. The physician should be alert to this diagnosis, and special attention should be paid to dementia patients who exhibit parkinsonism, hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, or prominent visuosperceptual deficits.The diagnosis of Lewy body dementia has important implications. It is associated with a high incidence of neuroleptic sensitivity, necessitating great caution in the use of these common antipsychotic agents. Early studies indicate cholinesterase inhibitors can be beneficial for treating the hallucinations and behavior disturbances that afflict these patients and might also improve cognition.",

The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities.

      "title": "Clinical and demographic data and the significance of various dysfunctions and severity indicators in multiple sclerosis patients",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Visual and oculomotor disorders are frequent manifestations of nervous system damage in multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is associated with an increased risk of falls, degeneration of sensory organization, and a possible increased reliance on vision for balance control. The clinical picture of multiple sclerosis is characterized by numerous neurological symptoms, among which visual and oculomotor disorders occupy a significant place. This is because the consequences of inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration often negatively affect both the afferent and efferent parts of visual function, significantly worsening the quality of life of patients with multiple sclerosis. Objective: To determine the clinical and demographic characteristics, the significance of nervous system dysfunction and disability, the degree of visual and oculomotor impairment, severity of pain, fatigue, depression, and cognitive impairments, quality of life indicators in patients with multiple sclerosis and to identify the peculiarities of their course in terms of comorbidity. Materials and methods: A total of 216 patients with various forms of multiple sclerosis were examined. Clinical-demographic data, paraclinical characteristics of nervous system dysfunction and disability, severity of pain, fatigue, depression, cognitive disorders and quality of life indicators were analyzed. Patients were assessed using the Functional System Scale (FS), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), an extended neuropsychological examination. The presence and duration of comorbid diseases were clinically determined through laboratory and instrumental studies, as well as examinations by other specialists (ophthalmologist, therapist, cardiologist, rheumatologist, urologist, and dentist). Results: When conducting a study of patients with multiple sclerosis of the general sample, symptoms associated with pyramidal functions impairment were in 191 patients (88.4%), symptoms caused by the cerebellar functions impairment - in 178 patients (82.4%), symptoms caused by brainstem and cranial nerve dysfunction – in 161 patients (74.5%), symptoms associated with impaired sensitivity functions – in 169 patients (78.2%), symptoms due to pelvic disorders – in 187 patients (87.0%), symptoms caused by impaired visual functions – in 116 patients (53.7%), symptoms associated with impaired cerebral (mental) functions – in 184 patients (85.2%). In total, visual disorders were recorded in 116 (53.7%) patients with multiple sclerosis, among them - in 46 (21.3%) patients of I group (without comorbidity) and in 70 (32.4%) patients of II group (with presence of comorbidity), and oculomotor disorders - in 168 (77.8%) patients with multiple sclerosis, among them - in 77 (35.6%) patients of group I (without comorbidity) and in 91 (42.1%) patients of group II (with presence of comorbidity). In patients with multiple sclerosis, according to the data of the FS-3 FS scale (oculomotor disorders), the average indicators were as follows: group I - 1.4 ± 0.3; group II - 1.6 ± 0.3, and according to the FS-6 FS scale (visual disorders), the average indicators were as follows: group I - 0.8 ± 0.2, group II - 1.4 ± 0.3. Conclusions: The prevalence of visual disorders of patients with multiple sclerosis was 56.0%, and oculomotor disorders - 85.2%. Oculomotor disorders were more widely represented in patients with multiple sclerosis, which, in our opinion, is associated with damage to the structures of the posterior longitudinal bundle, which is often affected in multiple sclerosis due to the “dissemination in space” characteristic of the disease. It was found that in patients with multiple sclerosis visual disorders were most clearly correlated with the level of depression and cognitive impairment. Oculomotor disorders in patients with multiple sclerosis were most clearly correlated with levels of fatigue. In the group of patients with multiple sclerosis with comorbid pathology, visual and oculomotor disorders were significantly more prevalent.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT BHLHE22 encodes a Class II basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (bHLH). It is expressed exclusively in the retina and central nervous system (CNS), and functions as an important regulator of retinogenesis and neuronal differentiation. Mice lacking bhlhe22 show nearly complete loss of three brain comminsure, including the corpus callosum. Here we report eleven individuals from nine unrelated families with BHLHE22 variants, with a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting with absent or limited speech, severely impaired motor abilities, intellectual disability (ID), involuntary movements, autistic traits with stereotypies, abnormal muscle tone. The majority of individuals have partial or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). Additional symptoms comprised epilepsy, variable dysmorphic features, and eye anomalies. One additional individual had spastic paraplegia without delayed development and ACC, expanding the phenotype to milder and later onset forms. Four individuals carry de novo missense variants within the highly conserved helix-loop-helix domain while seven individuals from five unrelated families carry a recurrent homozygous frameshift variant, p.(Gly74Alafs*18). Our findings implicate BHLHE22 variants in causing a previously unidentified autosomal dominant and recessive neurodevelopmental disorder associated with ACC, severe motor, language, and cognitive delays, abnormal tone, and involuntary movements. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Class II bHLH variants in humans shown to significantly disrupt brain development, cognition, and movement.",

How the cognition progress to dementia is a key to be explored. The cognitive impairment shows two profiles: cortical (memory encoding, visuospatial abilities, and language) and subcortical, with a dysexecutive syndrome that includes deficits in recognition memory, attention processes, and visual perception as well as visual hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations. Behavioral problems such as apathy, anxiety, depression, and impulse control disorders take a significant part in the loss of autonomy and progression of the disease. To detect the risk of Parkinson’s disease dementia development, the integral evaluation of patients in all stages of the disease should consider the interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors, motor subtypes, and non-motor symptoms (NMS) in order to implement different therapeutics and supportive strategies when they are likely to have efficacy.",

      "title": "Cognitive Impairments in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "The clinical neuropsychologic profiles of patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with SDAT show both overlap and dissociation. Speech, language, and certain memory skills are examples of dissociable differences, especially in the early stages of the disease. Furthermore the presence of depression, evidence of cognitive slowing, and absence of aphasia in patients with Parkinson's disease suggest prominent subcortical involvement. It is probably premature to categorize all of the cognitive changes in patients with Parkinson's disease as subcortical, however. Some skills, such as visuospatial and executive functions, are impaired in both disorders, and although the etiologic bases for task failure may differ for each, this issue remains open-ended. Another problem is that often the evidence for or against the cortical/subcortical distinction is insufficient and in some cases based on a single measure thought to be representative of a given cognitive domain. Most importantly there are few comparative studies that provide unequivocal support for making a cortical/subcortical distinction. Failure to equate for level of cognitive impairment or functional disability between dementias and strict adherence to cross-sectional study designs further compromise efforts to characterize each syndrome precisely. Whitehouse suggested that a prospective study of several different dementias studied in parallel, examining a wide range of cognitive skills, is required before the cortical/subcortical classification scheme can be validated. A critical component is an autopsy program to confirm diagnoses and provide clinicopathologic correlation. It is possible that the diverse nature of the cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease is not a methodologic artifact but reflects multiple disease subtypes. Ross, Mahler, and Cummings proposed three dementia syndromes in patients with Parkinson's disease: one that is relatively mild and meets the criteria for subcortical dementia, a second that is more severe and shows a wider range of cognitive impairment but is still neuropathologically distinct from SDAT, and a third severe dementia with both subcortical and cortical involvement that may reflect basal ganglia and Alzheimer-type pathology.",

      "title": "Practical Recommendations for Hypnotic Switching in Insomnia Management: A Canadian Expert Clinical Framework",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a complex condition in which patients experience difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening. Chronic insomnia is defined as dissatisfying sleep quality or quantity, occurring at least three times per week, that has persisted for at least three months. Insomnia is common, with a higher incidence in certain subpopulations, including older adults (≥65 years of age) and patients with psychiatric and physical comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and alcohol or substance use disorders. Individuals experiencing insomnia often have disrupted sleep architecture, with polysomnography showing reduced time spent in the rejuvenating slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. As such, insomnia can seriously impair daytime functioning, cognition, and quality of life. Further, insomnia may result in a higher risk of various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, though the association between insomnia and these comorbidities is likely bi-directional. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the diagnosis is often missed or trivialized in medical practice. Given the profound impact of chronic insomnia, a proactive diagnosis and successful treatment is essential. The primary non-pharmacologic treatment option available for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on sleep hygiene techniques, sleep restriction, circadian rhythm therapy, and cognitive therapy. Although CBT-I is the first-line treatment for insomnia and should always be recommended, it may not always be available in a timely manner, it can be costly and not every patient can afford it, some patients choose to opt out, and may not be sufficient as a single therapy approach. Thus, in many cases, pharmacotherapy may be needed in addition to or instead of CBT-I to treat insomnia and improve daytime functioning and associated cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Of note, patients also often self-medicate with over-the-counter medications, including cannabis products. Currently, commonly prescribed medications for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs; e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam) and Z-drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone).10 In addition, despite their risks, antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have also been used to treat insomnia despite being off-label and promoting sleep indirectly.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Early‐onset benign childhood occipital seizures (EBOS) described by Panayiotopoulos constitute the commoner after the rolandic phenotype of a childhood seizure susceptibility syndrome. EBOS are the clinical representative of occipital spikes. Their cardinal features are infrequent (often single) partial seizures manifested with deviation of the eyes and vomiting, frequently evolving to hemi‐ or generalized convulsions. Ictal behavioral changes, irritability, pallor, and rarely cyanosis, and eyes wide open are frequent. Retching, coughing, aphemia, oropharyngolaryngeal movements, and incontinence may occur. Consciousness is usually impaired or lost, either from the onset or the course of the fits, but in a few children, it may be preserved. Duration varies from a few minutes to hours (partial status epilepticus). Seizures are usually nocturnal, but semiology is similar in nocturnal or diurnal fits. Onset is between 1 and 12 years with a peak at 5 years. One third of children have a single seizure, the median total number of fits is two to three, and the prognosis is invariably excellent, with remission usually occurring within I year from onset. A few children may later develop rolandic or other benign partial seizures. The likelihood to have seizures after age 12 years is exceptional and rarer than that of febrile convulsions. EEG shows occipital paroxysms demonstrating fixation‐off sensitivity, but random occipital spikes, occipital spikes in sleep EEG alone, or normal EEG may occur. Centrotemporal and other spike foci may appear in the same or more frequently in subsequent EEGs. The EEG does not reflect clinical course and severity.",

This problem was addressed by comparing neuropsychological performance in the early and later stages of PD. Impairment of recent memory, impairment of cognition, and somatic features of depression were seen early and worsened with more advanced disease. Impairment of visuospatial skills, remote memory, language, and mood were observed only in the later stages of PD. These findings suggest that neuropsychological impairments do not develop in a uniform manner with progression of PD.",

      "title": "Non-verbal Cognitive Dysfunction in Children with Specific Language Impairment",
      "abstract": "Background: Language deficits occur in a series of developmental disorders and are widely recognized as characteristic symptoms of a range of developmental clinical conditions. In fact, Specific Language Impairment (hereafter SLI) is currently defined as a significant impairment of the child's linguistic abilities on several levels (phonology, morphology, lexical, syntax, narrative) by the presence of non-verbal IQ scores in the normal range; the diagnosis is based on a set of inclusionary and exclusionary criteria including performance at least one standard deviation below age expectations on a generic language assessment but 'normal' non-verbal intelligence. Of course, the term 'normal' non-verbal intelligence raises issues about what constitutes a 'normal' non-verbal IQ in a-/typical development and must be handled with care. However, according to the classical definition (ICD-10-GM version 2009; F80.- 'Umschriebene Entwicklungsstorungen des Sprechens und der Sprache') a child with SLI performs below age expectations on language measures despite having adequate cognitive and sensory skills for typical development with no obvious identifiable cause such as hearing loss, brain injuries or other neurological disorders.\r\nMorphology studies of individuals with developmental language disorders claim reversed asymmetry or symmetry of the planum temporale and the pars triangularis (Wernicke's and Broca's area), yet so far there is no clear evidence that children with SLI have marked anatomical differences from other children in either brain hemisphere. Moreover, some indication suggest a possible genetic link because SLI can be passed down from parents to children - although such a SLI-gene of course hasn't been identified thus far. Hence, the investigations of etiological factors are at a premature and inconclusive stage of inquiry and so far nothing but speculative causes can be mentioned.\r\nTo sum up, current literature on SLI hardly defines a language profile as 'typical' for SLI given that the spectrum of the disorder is very broad and yet unclear since in both, academic and clinical practice, the 'specific' characteristics of this developmental impairment have been questioned. After all, the fluidity of the diagnosis, making it difficult to border SLI, should actually be considered an important descriptive aspect, portraying the interactive nature of 'specific' cognitive systems. In fact, this study is motivated by the interest in the extensive issue whether there is a relationship between language impairments and impairments on general levels of nonverbal cognitive skills, as part of the broader question of the nature of language and cognition. \r\nThus, the aim of this study is to profile a child's performance across linguistic and cognitive domains, to determine if the domains are similar or discrepant in levels of performance.\r\nMethods: 30 typically developing children and 12 children with SLI between 5;0-9;0 years were tested on both their verbal and non-verbal abilities with respectively two standardized tests each. The children with SLI were all currently in therapy and classified as 'SLI' by their speech and language pathologists. All participants were from South Tyrol or Vienna and therefore German native speakers with dialectical colouring; some had a bilingual background, this fact was of course taken into consideration while analyzing the results. To 'measure' the child's non-verbal performances level the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (parallel form) and the 'Zahlensymboltest' of the HAWIK-R was used. The Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices were used to give an indication about the child's (4;9-12;00) non-verbal performance; in each test item, a candidate is asked to identify the missing segment required to complete a larger pattern. \r\nThe verbal abilities were assessed with the German version of the standardized TROG-D (original edition by D.V.M. Bishop,1989; German by Annette V. Fox, 2006) which is used to test a child's (3;0-10;11) general linguistic and grammatical comprehension. However, some items (Set 'R') were discarded since the linguistic construction is not common in the children's dialect and therefore not recognizable by them. As a second test, the first part (forward digit span) of the 'Zahlennachsprechen' of the HAWIK-R assessed the phonological loop of the short term memory, while the second part (backward digit span) not only demands phonological memorizing but also the ability to act upon the shortly memorized item. \r\nThe test battery was reduced to these four items in order to successfully conduct the experiment without losing the child's attentiveness and interest. Each test session lasted for 20-35 minutes circa, depending on the child's accomplishment. In case the child was unable to concentrate or to carry out the given tasks, the experiment was stopped up and the results gained so far were used.\r\nResults: The preliminary results show a slight tendency towards underage-expected performance of the children diagnosed with 'SLI' in non-verbal tests compared to the control group. So far, this research alludes to a range of non-verbal cognitive mechanisms interacting with language and having its implications in delineating the profile of SLI. \r\nConclusions: Many of the studies of children with language impairments who do or do not display cognitive impairments are motivated by the interest in the broader issue of the relationship between language and cognition. The extent to which the two domains of language and general cognitive abilities are inherently singular or modular remains unresolved and controversial. However, this work has shown that to a small but noticeable extent the domains of cognition and language can operate as orthogonal dimensions. According to these findings, the definition of SLI as specifically and exclusively linked to language must be revised, since the characteristics of this developmental disorder seem to be wider than first documented.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Specific Language Impairment, Cognition, Non-verbal IQ, Developmental Disorder;\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n[1]\tLeonard L.

En raison de nombreux points communs entre la demence parkinsonienne (DMP), stade tres evolue de la maladie de Parkinson, et la DCL, de nombreux auteurs ont suggere de fusionner ces deux entites. En pratique clinique, il reste utile de distinguer la DMP de la DCL en reservant le terme de DCL aux patients chez lesquels les troubles cognitifs sont apparus precocement au cours de leur maladie. Les criteres diagnostiques de DMP recemment proposes sont plus precis que ceux du DSMIV et devraient permettre un diagnostic plus precoce. La survenue d’hallucinations, d’une diminution d’activite non expliquee par les signes moteurs ou d’une apathie chez un patient doit faire chercher une atteinte des fonctions superieures. En debut d’evolution, il peut etre difficile de distinguer sur la presentation cognitive une DCL d’une maladie d’Alzheimer. Le DAT-scan, l’existence d’hallucinations et de troubles du comportement en sommeil paradoxal doivent orienter vers une DCL. Le tableau cognitif est plus evocateur quand il associe des signes dysexecutifs et visuospatiaux. La rivastigmine est le seul inhibiteur de l’acetylcholinesterase a avoir eu son indication dans la DMP et il existe des elements en faveur de l’efficacite de cette famille therapeutique dans la DCL. La prise en charge de ces patients doit etre globale.

      "title": "Disorders of head-eye coordination.",
      "abstract": "Head-eye coordination subserves the rapid transference of gaze and between gaze shifts stabilizes fixation on stationary or smoothly moving targets. The coordination involves various combinations of the components of head movement, saccadic eye movements and visual and vestibular slow phase eye movement whose fine tuning may be adjusted, to an extent currently debated, by higher order mechanisms. Disorders of head-eye coordination may result in loss of acuity when slow phases are impaired or difficulty with reorientation if there is difficulty with saccades or head movement. Pathophysiology in the brain stem affecting individual components of eye movement may often be identified with success, particularly for the horizontal system, but the organization of other functions, notably pursuit suppression and vertical movements, are little understood. Similarly little is known about the disorders of the overall pattern of coordination--'gaze types'--including the apraxias, which have been attributed to cortical, basal ganglia or even cerebellar dysfunction and are reported in an almost bewildering variety of diseases. The development of coordination in infancy is a rich field in which there have been few studies with adequate observational techniques. The differentiation between congenital disorders whose severity may subsequently wax or wane, variants on normal development and acquired disorders poses a clinical problem which could largely be resolved with adequate recording techniques. For the future there is the tantalizing promise that once the principles of coordination are understood, we can move on to the more intriguing questions of how a certain 'toss of the head' and 'look in the eye' not only transfer gaze but can also be so meaningful.",

      "abstract": "A few observations regarding transient smartphone blindness (TSB) being misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS), as noted by Drs. Sathiamoorthi and Wingerchuk,1 require further discussion: 1. While optic neuritis cases may exhibit amaurosis fugax, diagnosis requires visual decline, relative afferent papillary defect, color vision or visual field changes, and pain during ocular movements with or without changes in the optic disc on funduscopy. Therefore, the ocular features of the presented case did not support the diagnosis of optic neuritis.1 We agree that MS diagnosis requires careful consideration of clinical features and clinical examination in addition to MRI features. 2. Binocular vision has the advantage of increased visual field, stereopsis, compensation for blind spot, and improved visuomotor functions.2 Monocular viewing is uncommon in humans with binocular vision, thus the clinical relevance of TSB needs further evaluation.3 3. Differential visual perception may occur with monocular exposure to any bright object, not only a smartphone. 4. Slow dark adaptation is a feature of diseases affecting the retinoid cycle and signal transduction or transmission of rod photoreceptors.4,5 Vitamin A deficiency and some forms of congenital stationary blindness, which may have an apparently normal fundus, may need to be ruled out in cases with exaggerated TSB.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "title": "LMNB1-Related Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics LMNB1-related autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a slowly progressive disorder of central nervous system white matter characterized by onset of autonomic dysfunction in the fourth to fifth decade, followed by pyramidal and cerebellar abnormalities resulting in spasticity, ataxia, and tremor. Autonomic dysfunction can include bladder dysfunction, constipation, postural hypotension, erectile dysfunction, and (less often) impaired sweating. Pyramidal signs are often more prominent in the lower extremities (e.g., spastic weakness, hypertonia, clonus, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilateral Babinski signs). Cerebellar signs typically appear at the same time as the pyramidal signs and include gait ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, dysmetria, and nystagmus. Many individuals have sensory deficits starting in the lower limbs. Pseudobulbar palsy with dysarthria, dysphagia, and forced crying and laughing may appear in the seventh or eighth decade. Although cognitive function is usually preserved or only mildly impaired early in the disease course, dementia and psychiatric manifestations can occur as late manifestations. Affected individuals may survive for decades after onset. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LMNB1-related ADLD is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and MRI findings and either an LMNB1 duplication or (more rarely) a heterozygous deletion upstream of the LMNB1 promoter identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. For autonomic dysfunction: Neurogenic bladder may require management of urinary retention and/or urgency and recurrent urinary tract infection. Constipation may require good hydration, increased dietary fiber, stool softeners, and/or laxatives. Orthostatic hypotension can be minimized by pharmacologic intervention, compression stockings, physical therapy, and increased dietary salt. Erectile dysfunction is treated medically. Impaired sweating is managed with cool environment and attention to fever during infection. Spasticity may be treated with medications and physical therapy. Ataxia can be managed with strategies to minimize falls and increase strength, and adaptive equipment such as walkers or wheelchairs. Feeding difficulties can be managed with speech therapy and appropriate feeding interventions to assure adequate nutrition while preventing aspiration pneumonia. Surveillance: Routine assessment of: weight, nutrition, and feeding; pulmonary status (re possible recurrent pneumonia); bladder and erectile function; psychosocial well-being; and medications/doses to avoid iatrogenic polypharmacy. At least yearly assessment: by a neurologist for disease manifestations and progression; and by a physiatrist, orthopedist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist to address orthopedic, equipment, and functional needs. Genetic counseling LMNB1-related ADLD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all individuals diagnosed with LMNB1-related ADLD whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as the result of a large LMNB1 duplication (or a deletion upstream of LMNB1) inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an individual with LMNB1-related ADLD has a 50% chance of inheriting the LMNB1 duplication (or deletion upstream of LMNB1). Once the causative pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for LMNB1-related ADLD are possible.",

After adjustment for depressive symptoms, elevated state anxiety was associated with higher levels of wake after sleep onset (measured by both actigraphy and sleep log) and shorter sleep onset latency (measured by sleep log). Higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with greater wake after sleep onset (measured by sleep log). Elevated state and trait anxiety were associated with worse social functioning, and higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with worse role functioning.

From the clinical perspective, the sleep–wakefulness continuum is subject to many neurological disorders, orientation and awareness are dependent on the integrity of the vestibular and visual systems, and there is always the possibility of a developing neurodegenerative condition with the subtleties of impaired cognition.

Assessments may involve potential aircrew with a history of a neurological problem and aircrew who develop a neurological problem, as well as potential aircrew without any history of a neurological condition or of neurological symptoms and established aircrew attending for renewal of their medical certificate. In aeromedical practice the vast majority of individuals have neither a history nor symptoms of a neurological condition.",

      "abstract": "This case report describes three separate episodes of isolated ataxia, hallucinations of being accompanied by another person, and bilateral dressing apraxia occurring in a single individual without prior warning signs. These symptoms are attributable to disruption of vestibular processing in the temporoparietal cortex or associated limbic structures. Neurological dysfunction at high altitude is usually ascribed to high altitude cerebral edema or acute mountain sickness. However, transient neurological symptoms occur abruptly at more extreme altitudes, often following vigorous exertion, without overt altitude-induced prodromes. These symptoms may be caused by intense neuronal discharge or neuronal synchronization as a feature of epileptic discharges or cortical spreading depression. Transient high altitude neurological dysfunction should be recognized as a separate complication of extreme altitude, distinct from high altitude cerebral edema.",

      "abstract": "The educational and social progress of a child with epilepsy depends not only on seizure control but also on cognitive and behavioral factors. The various epilepsy syndromes of childhood and adolescence differ greatly in terms of cognitive and behavioral outcome. A high proportion of babies who have West syndrome and children who have Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy) will have long-term cognitive and behavioral problems. The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome also often has a poor prognosis in this regard. Children with the Landau-Kleffner syndrome have a variable prognosis, some regain speech and others have permanent speech impairment. Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is now recognised as lying on a spectrum with the Landau-Kleffner syndrome: mild cases have few if any cognitive or behavioral problems but others may have quite severe difficulties. People with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy may have characteristics suggesting frontal lobe impairment. The educational and social impairments associated with the epilepsy syndromes of childhood and adolescence are of major importance but they have been the subject of remarkably few well-performed studies. The impairments are not always necessarily permanent and it seems highly likely that the cognitive and behavioural outcome of at least some of these syndromes can be influenced greatly by early effective treatment with either antiepileptic medication or surgery.",

Modern sleep research has opened important views into the structure of sleep and the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. In a narrower sense sleep disorders mean a deficiency of sleep (hyposomnia). This may concern the induction of sleep or its maintenance. Sleep disorders without underlying disease may be differentiated from those caused by different diseases. Hypersomnia may occur as a symptom of various cerebral dysfunctions and processes, as an episodic disorder (Kleine-Levin-syndrome) or as a part of the Pickwick-syndrome. In narcolepsy characteristic symptoms are sleep attacks, kataplexy (emotionally induced loss of muscle tone) and transient pareses during awakening. Disturbances linked with sleep are snoring, somnambulism, speaking and grinding of the teeth during sleep and nocturnal enuresis. They may constitute idiopathic disorders. On the other hand, there may be similarities between epileptic phenomena and these disorders. Some epilepsies demonstrate relations to the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness which become evident in the manifestation of seizures and epileptiform EEG activity at certain stages of vigilance.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "title": "Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is characterized by clusters of nocturnal motor seizures, which are often stereotyped and brief (5 seconds to 5 minutes). They vary from simple arousals from sleep to dramatic, often bizarre hyperkinetic events with tonic or dystonic features. Affected individuals may experience aura. Retained awareness during seizures is common. A minority of individuals experience daytime seizures. Onset ranges from infancy to adulthood. About 80% of individuals develop ADNFLE in the first two decades of life; mean age of onset is ten years. Clinical neurologic examination is normal and intellect is usually preserved, but reduced intellect, psychiatric comorbidity, or cognitive deficits may occur. Within a family, the manifestations of the disorder may vary considerably. ADNFLE is lifelong but not progressive. As an individual reaches middle age, attacks may become milder and less frequent. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ADNFLE is established in a proband who has suggestive clinical findings combined with a family history that is positive for other affected individuals and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CHRNA4, CHRNB2, CHRNA2, KCNT1, DEPDC5, or CRH on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Carbamazepine is associated with remission in about 70% of individuals, often in relatively low doses. Individuals with ADNFLE associated with the CHRNA4 pathogenic variant p.Ser284Leu are more responsive to zonisamide than carbamazepine. Resistance to AEDs, present in about 30% of affected individuals, requires a trial of all appropriate AEDs. Adjunctive fenofibrate therapy or vagal nerve stimulation may be considered for individuals resistant to AEDs. Surveillance: Reevaluation of EEGs at regular intervals to monitor disease progression. Evaluation of relatives at risk: A medical history from relatives at risk can identify those with ADNFLE so that treatment can be initiated promptly. Pregnancy management: Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given antiepileptic drug during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling ADNFLE is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with ADNFLE have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown, as the frequency of subtle signs of the disorder in parents has not been thoroughly evaluated and molecular genetic data are insufficient. Penetrance is estimated at 70% and the risk to each offspring of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%; thus, the chance that the offspring will manifest ADNFLE is (50% x 70% =) 35%. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dizziness is one of the commonest symptoms described by older adults, particularly women, and is associated with reduced quality of life, functional decline, and falls. The term dizziness is used by patients to describe a variety of symptoms, including a hallucination of movement (vertigo), light-headedness, and a true appreciation of unsteadiness associated with gait disorders. Although there are age-related decrements in the somatosensory, visual, vestibular, and motor systems, dizziness should not be regarded as part of normal ageing. Diagnosis can usually be reached without specialist investigations, through focused history taking and bedside clinical assessment, including careful examination of eye movements and the Dix-Hallpike test. The underlying cause may be in one or several physiological systems and this will guide treatment plans. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and neuritis are more common than Meniere’s. The presence of red flag symptoms or signs suggesting central vestibular disease will require further imaging.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To determine whether polysomnographic REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) distinguishes between clinically diagnosed synucleinopathy (SYN) and non-synucleinopathy (NSYN) etiologies of cognitive impairment and/or parkinsonism. Background: Neurodegenerative disease arises more commonly secondary to two proteinopathies; alpha-synuclein [(Parkinson disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)] and tau [(Alzheimer’s dementia (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal syndrome (CBS)], although other proteinopathies frequently co-exist. Symptom overlap complicates accurate antemortem diagnosis and additional diagnostic tools to distinguish between clinically diagnosed SYN and NSYN etiologies are needed. Design/Methods: We analyzed quantitative RSWA in 138 patients; 73 SYN (33 PD, 20 MSA, 20 DLB), 50 NSYN (15 AD, 11 FTD, 17 PSP, 7 CBS), and 15 primary snoring controls. Phasic, tonic, and “any” muscle activity percentages and phasic burst durations were calculated in the submentalis (SM) and anterior tibialis (AT) muscles. The automated REM atonia index was also determined in SM. Statistical group comparisons and regression were performed, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves used to determine RSWA cutoffs that distinguished SYN from NSYN. Results: All RSWA measures were significantly greater in SYN patients. SM cutoffs with AUC >0.9 (sensitivity, specificity) were: “any” 11.5% (75%, 96%); phasic 10.8% (75%, 98%); phasic burst duration 0.61 seconds (74%, 94%). In contrast, AT SYN discrimination was poor. Cutoffs were similar irrespective of clinical dream enactment behavior. Subgroup analysis showed greatest SM RSWA in patients with MSA, similar RSWA elevations in PD and DLB patients, and control level RSWA in AD, FTD, PSP and CBS patients. Conclusions: Quantitative submentalis REM sleep muscle activity accurately distinguished clinically diagnosed SYN from NSYN etiologies, even without clinical dream enactment. Polysomnographic RSWA appears to be a useful diagnostic tool for probable alpha-synucleinopathy in patients with parkinsonism and/or cognitive impairment.

      "title": "Down syndrome: Cognitive and behavioral functioning across the lifespan",
      "abstract": "Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) commonly possess unique neurocognitive and neurobehavioral profiles that emerge within specific developmental periods. These profiles are distinct relative to others with similar intellectual disability (ID) and reflect underlying neuroanatomic findings, providing support for a distinctive phenotypic profile. This review updates what is known about the cognitive and behavioral phenotypes associated with DS across the lifespan. In early childhood, mild deviations from neurotypically developing trajectories emerge. By school‐age, delays become pronounced. Nonverbal skills remain on trajectory for mental age, whereas verbal deficits emerge and persist. Nonverbal learning and memory are strengths relative to verbal skills. Expressive language is delayed relative to comprehension. Aspects of language skills continue to develop throughout adolescence, although language skills remain compromised in adulthood. Deficits in attention/executive functions are present in childhood and become more pronounced with age. Characteristic features associated with DS (cheerful, social nature) are personality assets. Children are at a lower risk for psychopathology compared to other children with ID; families report lower levels of stress and a more positive outlook. In youth, externalizing behaviors may be problematic, whereas a shift toward internalizing behaviors emerges with maturity. Changes in emotional/behavioral functioning in adulthood are typically associated with neurodegeneration and individuals with DS are higher risk for dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Individuals with DS possess many unique strengths and weaknesses that should be appreciated as they develop across the lifespan. Awareness of this profile by professionals and caregivers can promote early detection and support cognitive and behavioral development. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Circadian rhythm (CR) dysfunction is a prominent feature in bipolar disorder (BD) and sleep disturbances are characteristic, although not essential to the diagnosis. Objectives To review the literature regarding the CR dysfunction and its impact on the onset and clinical course of BD. Methods We conducted a MEDLINE search using bipolar disorder, circadian rhythm and sleep as keywords, selecting studies written in English. Results CR dysfunction is a trait marker of BD. It’s known that during depressive episodes insomnia is present, with difficulty falling asleep/ maintaining sleep and early awakening. Regarding mania, decreased need for sleep is a critical marker. During the euthymic period significant alterations in sleep pattern have been described. It’s also known that changes in the sleep pattern occur prior to those in mood patterns, indicating that sleep dysregulation may trigger the onset of mood episodes or relapses. Therefore, CR disruption may be associated with the pathophysiology of BD and some factors have already been identified: irregularity of the sleep-wake rhythm, eveningness chronotype, abnormality of melatonin secretion, vulnerability of clock genes and the irregularity of social zeitgeber. Conclusions Disturbances of sleep are pervasive, and an essential feature of BD, worse during mood episodes, but still present during euthymic periods. It remains to determine whether circadian rhythm dysfunction is a trait marker or mood state dependent. Further studies are warranted to clarify this association.

      "abstract": "Motor neurone disease is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative condition which causes progressive weakness, with normal sensation. It can occur at any age but is more frequent with increasing age. Key clinical presentations include bulbar (slurred or difficult speech, problems swallowing, tongue fasciculation), limb (typically in one limb with weakness and muscle wasting), respiratory (breathlessness, chest muscle fasciculation) and cognitive features (behavioural change, emotional lability, features of frontotemporal dementia). Although survival is typically three to five years from symptom onset, there is significant individual variation. Rarely, survival may be 20 years or longer. Favourable features include a limb rather than a bulbar presentation, preserved weight and respiratory function, younger age of onset and longer time from fist symptom to diagnosis. The patient should be linked to a multidisciplinary team able to provide support from the start with a designated individual as the point of contact, with regular, coordinated assessments, as the patient's needs change and their condition progresses. Gastrostomy is an important supportive intervention which maximizes nutrition, and minimizes aspiration and chest infection. Adequate nutrition and hydration is key to maximizing health and survival. It is possible for a patient to control a computer and speech by eye. movement alone. An important consideration is voice banking where the patient may store their voice before there is difficulty with speech so that it can be used at a later stage if they need a communication aid. Impaired cough and retention of respiratory secretions is frequent in the later stages, and may be managed with physiotherapy. The patient should be referred for expert respiratory assessment if needed.",

      "title": "Prognostic Counseling for Patients With Idiopathic/Isolated REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: Should We Tell Them What's Coming? Yes",
      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by often violent dream enactment behavior, such as sleep-related vocalization, screaming or shouting, punching, arm flailing, or kicking movements, that parallel the content of a nightmare or vivid dream.1, 2 Diagnosis requires confirmation by polysomnography (PSG), which demonstrates its neurophysiological signature of REM sleep atonia loss (a.k.a., REM sleep without atonia).3-5 iRBD has been recently demonstrated to be a common neurological disorder in the general population with a prevalence of approximately 1% to 2%.6, 7 Whether RBD is idiopathic/isolated (iRBD) or symptomatic, RBD is strongly associated with synucleinopathy neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and MSA.1, 2, 8-10 Even iRBD is strongly associated with symptoms or signs of an underlying covert syncleinopathy, with up to 80% of iRBD patients having nonmotor manifestations of autonomic, cognitive, olfactory, or visual manifestations, or \"soft\" motor signs insufficient for PD diagnosis of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, or postural instability at the time of diagnosis by PSG.10, 11 Approximately 70% of iRBD patients develop PD, DLB, or MSA over longitudinal follow-up of 10 to 15 years, and currently there is no proven beneficial neuroprotective strategy or therapy to prevent the evolution of increasingly devastating neurological deficits.10 Given this, there is currently prevailing uncertainty about the utility of prognostic counseling for iRBD patients, who are at high risk for future development of a neurodegenerative disorder. Should we tell them about their likely future, and if so, what should we tell them?12 Prognostic counseling in iRBD is further complicated by how the patient presents and is given the diagnosis. In between 50% to 60% of patients, dream enactment is not the patient's primary clinical complaint or concern in the sleep clinic, given that they may instead first present for concerns related to obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, hypersomnia symptoms, or chronic insomnia.13 Previous research suggests that sleep clinic populations are unsurprisingly enriched for the discovery of iRBD, with approximately 5% of sleep clinic cohorts having an iRBD diagnosis.14 In another recent study, 11% of patients had another presenting primary sleep complaint and RBD diagnosis was elicited only upon specific questioning, whereas 44% of patients in this cohort were unaware of their dream enactment behaviors.13 These data are consistent with our clinical experience in sleep medicine clinics where RBD is commonly discovered in the history taking process, by screening questionnaires, or even as a secondary and incidental finding during PSG indicated for another primary sleep concern. As such, not all iRBD patients receiving a diagnosis are aware of their dream enactment; many do not consider it a significant concern in their daily lives and are less likely to be seeking prognostic information. For these patients, relaying bad news is much more difficult than if the patient had a primary focus on their dream enactment as a chief complaint. Despite this differential presentation, recent evidence suggests that iRBD as a primary/chief or secondary complaint follows a similarly poor prognostic trajectory toward acquiring overt neurodegenerative disease.13 Currently, there are limited data concerning prognostic counseling of RBD patients. In one recent study, only 47% of adults with iRBD received prognostic counseling (or, at least, documentation concerning counseling), and male neurologists were most likely to have documented counseling in the electronic medical record.15 A more recent study of worldwide experts found that most RBD subspecialty experts provided prognostic counseling, but few asked patients their views concerning their preferences. There are currently no published studies concerning iRBD patient preferences regarding prognostic counseling. Given this evidence vacuum, providers must currently utilize their best judgment and individualize counseling for their specific patients. One prevailing view is that patients seem highly likely to learn about the strong associations between RBD and synucleinopathy risk regardless of what is discussed in the office, given wide availability of the Internet and increasing evidence that patients may seek medical information from this source. Given this, it may be logical to counsel proactively to avoid erosion of trust in the physician-patient relationship. The ethical principle of respect for autonomy holds that patients have a right for self-determination, including knowing as much as possible about their future risk and likelihood for developing a disease, and withholding prognostic information that may be valued by the patient would therefore constitute a breach of the physician's fiduciary responsibility. Despite the current lack of actionability for an ultimately poor and undesirable neurodegenerative disease, additional advantages for transparency in providing counseling to iRBD patients include future life planning regarding finances, health, and retirement. Informed by a likely future with a high risk for developing a neurodegenerative disease, iRBD patients who are currently healthy may want to contemplate their values and preferences for future health needs (including advance care directive documentation), purchase additional insurance for long-term care, ensure adequate financial resources available to support their future health needs, or even accelerate retirement planning (including pursuit of their individual \"bucket list\" wishes and plans). On the other hand, the principle of nonmaleficence demands that physicians carefully consider and minimize any potential harms that may be incurred by prognostic counseling. Whereas there is no evidence that prognostic counseling may be harmful for most patients, caution is needed especially for some individuals with significant mental health comorbidities who may be more vulnerable to experience worsened anxiety or deterioration in mood state. Asking about the iRBD patient's own values and preferences should be the first step in considering prognostic counseling. At a minimum, the iRBD patient should be informed that there is a strong association with other underlying or future neurological diseases, which then presents an opportunity to inquire whether they wish to know more about this association, and if so, when they would wish to be told, and in how much depth. Future research concerning iRBD patients' values and preferences is greatly needed, to inform best practices concerning counseling, but at the current time, at least discussing and documenting the strong iRBD/neurodegenerative disease risk association is a good start.

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a life-long neurological, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorder. Most frequent symptoms involve excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disrupted night-time sleep. The estimated prevalence of narcolepsy is 0.05%. Initial symptoms usually start in childhood and young adults. Diagnosis of narcolepsy is often problematic, and it can take up to 20 years between the first observed excessive sleepiness and a fully developed disorder. Both genetic and environmental contribute to narcolepsy onset. A very strong association was observed in the case of human leukocyte DQ antigens, especially DQB1_0602. We distinguish narcolepsy type 1 and 2. Diagnosis of both types is based on the patient’s history, confirmed by multiple sleep latency test (MLST) with preceding polysomnography (PSG). Highly specific findings in these examinations are SOREMPs – occurrence of REM period within 15 minutes after falling asleep. In narcolepsy type 1 cataplexy is present, and CSF hypocretin-1 concentration is undetectable as opposed to narcolepsy type 2. Early diagnosis and implemented treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of patients with narcolepsy. Non-pharmacological treatment such as good sleep habits and daytime naps play an important role in better symptom control. Pharmacological treatment helps to overcome hypersomnia and cataplexy. This review includes the most important clinical features of narcolepsy.",

      "abstract": "Examination of neuropsychological functioning in schizophrenia indicates that against a background of diffuse impairment, some neurocognitive domains are differentially impaired. These include attention, memory and, to a lesser extent, abstraction and mental flexibility ('executive functions'). The deficits are present at the onset of illness and persist despite clinical improvement. The severity of initial deficits is weakly related to initial severity of symptoms, but a follow-up longitudinal evaluation suggests that the less patients improve in negative symptoms, the less they improve in neuropsychological performance. By contrast, improvement in some positive symptoms is associated with less improvement in some neuropsychological functions. The cognitive deficits are related to data from structural and functional imaging. Lower temporal lobe volume is associated with poorer cognitive abilities, and abnormally high left temporal lobe metabolism is also associated with poorer memory. The interplay between cognitive functioning, measures of brain structure and function, and clinical data is complex and seems to merit intensive and focused investigation. Such work can help elucidate pathophysiologic processes related to the phenomenology of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Rare Clinical Image of Kennedy’s Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Sir, Bulbar motor neuron disease, often referred to as bulbar palsy or bulbar onset motor neuron disease, is a subtype of motor neuron disease (MND) that primarily affects the motor neurons located in the bulbar region of the brainstem.[1] This condition is characterized by the progressive degeneration of these motor neurons, leading to impairments in speech, swallowing, and sometimes breathing.[2] It falls under the broader category of neurodegenerative disorders, sharing similarities with conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).[3] The bulbar region of the brainstem is crucial for controlling essential functions such as chewing, swallowing, speaking, and breathing. Motor neurons in this area transmit signals from the brain to the muscles responsible for these actions. However, in bulbar motor neuron disease, these neurons gradually degenerate and lose their ability to function properly, resulting in the hallmark symptoms associated with the condition. One of the earliest and most prominent symptoms of bulbar motor neuron disease is dysarthria, a speech disorder characterized by slurred or unintelligible speech.[4] In addition to speech and swallowing impairments, individuals with bulbar motor neuron disease may also experience weakness and wasting of the facial muscles, leading to facial drooping or difficulty with facial expressions. The exact cause of bulbar motor neuron disease remains unclear, although it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Like other forms of motor neuron disease, bulbar onset disease is characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and eventual paralysis.[5] An 85-year-old male patient visited the neurology OPD with complaints of left-side weakness, difficulty swallowing solid food, mild discomfort with liquid food, and difficulty in speech articulation. He had a 15-year history of hypertension and had recently stopped taking antihypertensive medications. Over several months, his symptoms had progressively worsened, including slurred speech, recurrent choking during meals, and weakness in his facial muscles. The initial examination showed the patient to be conscious, cooperative, and well oriented. He was examined in a specific position, and his Glasgow Coma Scale score was E4V1M6. Additionally, the examination revealed the loss of certain reflexes, such as the gag reflex and jaw jerk reflex. Sensory examination indicated intact sensations, while motor examination showed reduced strength in the left upper and lower limbs. Diagnostic tests, including an MRI scan and blood tests, confirmed a diagnosis of bulbar disease. Figure 1a and b reveal the presence of a well-defined extra-axial crescent-shaped collection on the right cerebral hemisphere, with a maximum thickness of 2.5 cm. This collection appears hyperintense in T1WI and hypointense in T2/FLAIR, consistent with an early subacute subdural hematoma. The mass effect is evident, causing effacement of sulcal spaces and the ipsilateral lateral ventricle, along with a midline shift of 6 mm to the left. Additionally, there is focal right frontal periventricular white matter edema. Age-related changes are observed, with prominence in sulcogyral spaces, the cerebellar folia, and the ventricular system.Figure 1: MRI brain showing (a) Susceptibility weighted imaging with right subdural bleed, (b) T1WI imaging showing Subacute bleedPatient's consent The patient's guardian has provided a comprehensive and thorough consent.

The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

The frontostriatal and frontoparietal neural networks are thought to be particularly affected. Psychiatric phenotype shows a great variability. Around 30% of patients with 22q11 deletion syndrome develop paranoid syndromes but without negative symptoms or a defective state. Other clinical pictures are attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar depression or autistic spectrum disorders. Structural brain studies reported a decrease of brain volume with pronounced changes in the prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, cerebellum, and temporal lobe. Candidate genes locating within 22q11 deletion could effect brain development and neuropsychiatric outcome in patients, but evidence is still far from being conclusive. The role of 22q11 microdeletion in psychoses is still not defined; phenotype correlation could be helpful to elucidate biological bases.",

      "abstract": "In 10 female patients (age 2-26 years) with clinical evidence of Rett Syndrome (RS), unusual and prominent rhythmical theta activity (4-5/sec or 5-6/sec) proved to be the outstanding EEG feature. This pattern was present in waking state and/or sleep. When it was noted in the waking state, the localization (vertex, central region and vicinity) and blocking responses to active or passive movements suggested a slow equivalent of Rolandic mu rhythm (in two patients associated with a posterior 10-12/sec alpha rhythm). In sleep, rhythmical theta activity was either Rolandic or more diffuse, sometimes independently occurring with central spikes. The prominent rhythmical 4-5/sec or 5-6/sec activity and its relationship to Rolandic mu rhythm suggest a dysfunction of the motor cortex in RS. This would be congruent with the frequent observation of central spikes. EEG evidence of motor cortex dysfunction might be helpful in the understanding of this enigmatic disorder and conducive to the following hypothesis: RS is characterized by motor cortical dyscontrol due to primary frontal lobe dysfunction. The usefulness of EEG, however, is limited to insights into the (secondary) motor-cortex dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "The term 'stereotypies' encompasses a diverse range of movements, behaviours, and/or vocalizations that are repetitive, lack clear function, and sometimes appear to have a negative impact upon an individual's life. This review aims to describe motor stereotypies.This study reviewed the current literature on the nature, aetiology, and treatment of motor stereotypies.Motor stereotypies occur commonly but not exclusively in autistic spectrum disorders. Similar movements are also found in otherwise healthy children and those suffering sensory impairment, social isolation, or severe intellectual disabilities; they may be persistent over time. Although often difficult, it is possible to define and differentiate stereotypies from other movement disorders such as tics through features of the history, such as earlier onset and examination, together with the presence or absence of associated neurological impairment or developmental difficulties. Co-occurrence with other disorders affecting frontostriatal brain systems, including attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and tic disorders, is common.The underlying function of motor stereotypies remains unclear but may include the maintenance of arousal levels. A neurogenetic aetiology is proposed but requires further study. When treatment is sought, there are both pharmacological and behavioural options. Behavioural treatments for motor stereotypies may in time be shown to be most effective; however, they are difficult to implement in children younger than 7 years old.",

      "title": "Nonmotor manifestations of Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Traditionally, attention has focused on the motor symptomatology of PD, but it is now appreciated that the nonmotor symptoms affecting neuropsychiatric, sleep, autonomic, and sensory domains occur in up to 88% of PD patients and can be an important source of disability. Nonmotor manifestations of PD play a significant role in the impairment of disease-related quality of life. The cause of nonmotor manifestations of PD is multifactorial, but to a large extent, these manifestations are related to the nature of the neurodegenerative process and the widespread nondopaminergic neuropathological changes associated with the disease. Recognition of nonmotor disability is essential not only for ascertaining the functional status of patients but also for better appreciating the nature of the neurodegenerative process in PD. In addition, a number of nonmotor manifestations can precede the onset of motor symptoms in PD and can be used as screening tools allowing for early disease identification and for trials of possible disease-modifying interventions. This article reviews depression, sleep, and autonomic dysfunction in PD.",

      "title": "Cognitive Complaints in Motor Functional Neurological (Conversion) Disorders: A Focused Review and Clinical Perspective",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological (conversion) disorder (FND) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by sensorimotor symptoms exhibiting features incompatible with other neurologic diseases. Individuals with motor FND (mFND) typically present with limb weakness, nonepileptic seizures, and/or abnormal movements. However, this population also frequently reports clouded thinking, inattention, and memory difficulties. Cognitive complaints in individuals with mFND are important to evaluate as they may negatively impact quality of life and impede treatment engagement. We provide a narrative review of the neuropsychological testing literature detailing neurocognitive profiles of individuals with mFND. We also present three illustrative clinical cases at the intersection of mFND and cognitive concerns. Several studies and our case examples highlight that generally normal cognitive performance can be observed concurrently with subjective cognitive complaints in some individuals with mFND; this mismatch may be a possible “rule-in” sign of functional cognitive symptoms. Other studies have reported impairments in attention, memory, language, visuospatial, and executive functioning in individuals with mFND. These impairments could be related to medical-psychiatric comorbidities, psychotropic medication side effects, and intrinsic disease mechanisms. When evaluating individuals with mFND and their cognitive complaints, clinicians can use performance validity test and psychopathology findings to help them interpret the neuropsychological test results. Perceptual mismatches between intact objective cognitive performance and subjective cognitive complaints may reflect a negative attentional bias for cognitive abilities that can be targeted with cognitive retraining and cognitive behavioral therapy. Neuropsychological evaluations may provide a useful adjunctive tool clinicians can use to help assess individuals with mFND and cognitive concerns.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Assessment of patients who are blind can be complicated. In patients with Lewy body dementia (LBD), visuospatial abilities are often impaired early but assessment of these abilities is limited in patients who are blind. This case involved neuropsychological evaluation of a patient who is blind with suspected LBD and aims to expand existing literature. Method 75-year-old, blind (since early 20s) Caucasian female with onset of progressive cognitive decline 18 months prior and motor symptoms 12 months prior. Functional decline, cognitive fluctuations, hallucinations, and possible Rapid Eye Movement behavioral disorder were endorsed. MRI of the brain revealed “diffusely prominent perivascular spaces” and “chronic white matter ischemia”. Results Testing found deficits for verbal fluency, processing speed, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. This fronto-subcortical pattern of cognitive dysfunction and functional decline met criteria for mild dementia. Memory performance was variable but not indicative of Alzheimer’s dementia. History and symptoms raise concern for an underlying LBD. With vision loss, Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is a potential cause of some of the hallucinations but does not account for the other symptoms reported, which better support an LBD etiology. Conclusions This presentation aims to contribute to the limited literature surrounding assessment of LBD in patients who are blind. Aside from the obvious test selection restrictions, finding relevant research and available normative data surrounding neuropsychological assessment in this population is difficult due to the different causes and levels of vision impairment. Limited research surrounding the evaluation and diagnosis of LBD in patients who are blind further complicate this case.",

      "abstract": "Sleep difficulties are often leading symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that untreated insomnia predicts the onset of mental health disorders. Other sleep disorders also often cause mood and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, overlapping symptoms of sleep apnea, a sleep disorder with undoubted public health significance, and depression merits special attention. Sleep disorders have profound effect on daytime functioning causing daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. These symptoms may severely affect both the quality of life of the patient and also the sleep and quality of life of their bedpartners and family members, as well. It is increasingly appreciated that the majority of medically ill patients suffer from sleep disorders and sleep complaints, which contribute to their impaired quality of life and clinical outcomes. “Sleep Health” is an important aspect of everyone's life but has a special relevance in mentally or medically ill patients. In our studies focusing on patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (moderate to severe chronic renal failure, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) we have found high prevalence of sleep disorders (insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep, Sleep apnea). We have shown that they are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, increased illness intrusiveness and worse quality of life. Furthermore, RLS predicted mortality of kidney transplant recipients.

      "title": "Neuroimaging: connecting the pixels",
      "abstract": "Improving outcome for children with cerebral palsy is predicated on an understanding of the sequential links from etiological antecedents through brain pathophysiology, clinical phenotypes, and focused interventions to measured outcomes. Neuroimaging is the most widely utilized initial step in etiological investigation.1 Diagnostically, both abnormal and normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are beneficial; for example, a normal neuroimaging study in a child with dystonic cerebral palsy or spastic diplegia may point to the possibility of a neurotransmitter disorder.2 The study by Himmelmann et al.3 provides further insight into the relationship between the gestational timing of brain lesions using brain MRI and computed tomography, and the type and severity of sensory motor impairment. Consistent with previous neuroimaging studies, children with basal ganglia lesions were more likely to have severe motor impairments. Cortical/subcortical lesions were prevalent in children with five or more accompanying impairments. Children with mild motor impairment and few accompanying impairments were more likely to have periventricular white matter lesions or normal neuroimaging. Research findings of this population-based study are most generalizable to the geographically defined area studied. A notable strength of this study is the use of standardized functional assessments, such as the Gross Motor Function Classification System and Manual Ability Classification System, which provide a common language to evaluate research and outcomes across populations. This study, along with accumulating data from cohort and registry studies of children with cerebral palsy, helps inform evidence-based medicine. Studies exploring relationships between brain structure and function, interpreted within the emerging paradigm of brain plasticity, can help determine appropriate therapies. However, a ‘missing link’ remains the variability in selecting interventions for children with similar clinical and neuroimaging findings.4 For example, in children with spastic diplegia secondary to periventricular leukomalacia, one center might use selective dorsal rhizotomy and report success, while another employs intrathecal baclofen and claims equal benefit. Our challenge is, therefore, to carefully combine neuroimaging modalities with standardized measures of function and change and to further develop treatment options for both the motor and non-motor manifestations of cerebral palsy. While regional registries exist and are providing useful data,5 the ongoing development of international consortiums where data and experience can be combined to link etiology with treatment offer the best opportunity to optimize care for children with cerebral palsy.",

Approximately 30% of individuals with the 7q11.23 duplication have one or more congenital anomalies. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of the 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is established by detection of a recurrent 1.5- to 1.8-Mb heterozygous duplication of the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region (WBSCR). Management Treatment of manifestations: Aortic dilation is treated with beta blocker therapy and/or surgery as needed. Constipation should be aggressively managed at all ages to prevent encopresis and impaction. Address developmental disabilities, including ASD, through early intervention programs (including speech/language therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy), special education programs, and vocational training. Address ASD with applied behavior analytic interventions and other empirically supported psychosocial approaches. Address childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) or manifestations of this disorder with intensive speech/language therapy to maximize effective oral communication and prevent or limit later language impairment and/or reading disorder. Address emotional and behavioral disorders (aggression, social anxiety, selective mutism) with cognitive-behavioral therapy, applied behavior analysis behavior modification intervention, and psychotropic medications as needed. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of head circumference in infancy. Annual monitoring of aortic diameter (including Z scores in children) and behavior. Annual assessment by occupational and physical therapists and speech and language pathologists until age six years. Genetic counseling The 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. About 27% of probands have an affected parent.

We describe the clinical and neurophysiologic features of PME associated with SCARB2 mutations without renal impairment. Methods: Clinical and neurophysiologic investigations, including wakefulness and sleep electroencephalography (EEG), polygraphic recording (with jerk-locked back-averaging and analysis of the EEG–EMG (electromyography) relationship by coherence spectra and phase calculation), multimodal evoked potentials, and electromyography were performed on five Italian patients with SCARB2 mutations. Key Findings: The main clinical features were adolescent–young adulthood onset, progressive action myoclonus, ataxia, absence of cognitive deterioration and, in most cases, epilepsy. The severity of the epilepsy could vary from uncontrolled seizures and status epilepticus in patients with adolescent onset to absent or rare seizures in patients with adult onset. Relevant neurophysiologic findings were a pronounced photosensitivity and massive action myoclonus associated with rhythmic myoclonic jerks at a frequency of 12–20 Hz, clinically resembling a postural tremor. The cortical origin of rhythmic myoclonus was demonstrated mainly by coherence and phase analysis of EEG–EMG signals indicating a significant EEG–EMG coupling and a direct corticospinal transfer. Significance: Our patients with SCARB2 mutations showed the clinical and neurophysiologic phenotype of PME, in which epilepsy could be extremely severe, extending the spectrum reported in the typical AMRF syndrome. Patients with PME of unknown origin of adolescent or young adult onset, with these neurophysiologic features, should be tested for SCARB2 mutations, even in the absence of renal impairment.",

      "abstract": "We reviewed sleep and dream-related clinical symptoms in a set of four neurologic disorders (Parkinson’s Disease, REM Behavior Disorder, Narcolepsy and Depression) characterized by severe reductions in dopaminergic function. Sleep findings included excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), increased rapid eye movement sleep times (REM%), increased REM density or bursts of REMs, reduced REM latency periods, and sleep onset REM (SOREM). Clinical symptoms included perseverative or rigid thinking and personality styles, frontal lobe impairment, increased complaints of, or vulnerability to negative affect, and increased vivid and unpleasant dreams. The increased vulnerability to unpleasant dreams was particularly interesting as descriptions of dream content were strikingly similar across all 4 disorders. Dreams of feeling threatened or being attacked by animals or dangerous creatures were very frequent. We hypothesize that the cluster of sleep, dream and cognitive changes associated with these four disorders can be explained by assuming that lowered dopaminergic tone leads to a disinhibition of REM physiology and amygdalar activity and that this disinhibition of REM and amygdalar function yields unpleasant dreams, negative affect, and frontal lobe impairment. Careful study of the cluster of co-occurring symptoms identified here may illuminate 1) the ways in which dopamine might function in regulation of sleep states, and 2) aspects of the neurology of dream content.

His cognitive profile revealed declines in his intellectual functioning as well as visuospatial and executive deficits in the context of preserved attention, language, and memory.

      "abstract": "The term coma is used to refer to patients whose eyes are permanently closed and who cannot be awakened nor are in a functioning state.(1) According to Zasler,(2) coma is a state in which there is no meaningful response. Comatose patients normally maintain their eyes closed without evidence of opening spontaneously or to external stimuli, do not follow instructions, do not show goal-directed or voluntary conduct, do not speak and cannot sustain looking or tracking movements of more than a 45˚ angle. Excluded are secondary neurobehavioral signs and symptoms in coma that have been treated pharmacologically with sedatives. The definition of coma in terms of cerebral functioning refers to a state of acute brain failure not strictly related to any particular cerebral substratum or specific anatomical level of lesion. Coma normally occurs when broad areas in the upper and lower brain stems, or cerebral hemispheres, or simultaneously in the cerebral hemispheres and brain stem are damaged. The most frequent causes of coma are diffuse axonal pathology, hypoxia and secondary lesions which affect the brainstem (Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4).",

      "title": "Evidence of Neuroinflammation and Immunotherapy Responsiveness in Individuals with Down Syndrome Regression Disorder",
      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Background Down syndrome regression disorder is a symptom cluster consisting of neuropsychiatric regression without cause. This study evaluated the incidence of neurodiagnostic abnormalities in individuals with Down syndrome regression disorder and determine if abnormalities are indicative of responses to therapeutic intervention. Methods A retrospective, multi-center, case-control, study was performed. Patients were required to have subacute onset and the presence of four of five symptom groups present (cognitive decline, expressive language, sleep derangement, loss of ability to perform activities of daily living and/or a new movement disorder) and no other explanation for symptoms. Results Individuals with Down syndrome regression disorder were comparable to a cohort of individuals with only Down syndrome although had higher rates of autoimmune disease (<italic>p</italic>= 0.02, 95%CI: 1.04-1.75). Neurodiagnostic abnormalities were found on EEG (n=19, 26%), neuroimaging (n=16, 22%) and CSF (n=9, 17%). Pleocytosis was appreciated in five cases, elevated total protein in nine, elevated IgG index in seven, and oligoclonal bands in two. Testing within two years of symptom onset were more likely to have neurodiagnostic abnormalities (<italic>p</italic>= 0.01, 95%CI: 1.64-37.06). In individuals with neurodiagnostic abnormalities immunotherapy was nearly four times more likely to have a therapeutic effect than in those without neurodiagnostic abnormalities (OR: 4.11, 95%CI: 1.88-9.02). In those with normal neurodiagnostic studies (n=43), IVIg was effective in 14 of 17 (82%) patients as well although other immunotherapies were uniformly ineffective. Conclusions This study reports the novel presence of neurodiagnostic testing abnormalities in individuals with Down syndrome regression disorder, providing credence to this symptom cluster potentially being of neurologic and/or neuroimmunologic etiology.",

      "title": "Identification of parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common movement disorder associated with considerable disability. The clinical syndrome of parkinsonism is based on the presence of core clinical features of rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and impaired postural reflexes or gait. Parkinsonism is most often caused by Parkinson's disease, but can also be caused by other disorders, including cerebrovascular disease, multiple-system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and other disorders. Parkinsonism can be identified by questionnaires and confirmed in person or by videotaped clinical examinations. The identification of presymptomatic cases remains problematic but is motivated by the hope for treatment before symptoms appear. Quantitative approaches to the diagnosis of parkinsonism based on the measurement of the cardinal features are available. Clinical approaches should include identification of features atypical for Parkinson's disease, which exclude the diagnosis, and documentation of a response to dopaminergic medications, which support a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Loss of smell and visual dysfunction are found in early patients and may be useful in screening protocols. In addition, behavioral changes, including depressive symptoms, may be detected in presymptomatic cases. Cognitive changes, such as impaired set shifting, have been observed in early Parkinson's disease, but can be seen with other causes of parkinsonism. Neuroimaging techniques, including positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography, are available to quantify dopaminergic neurons, while magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in differentiating other forms of parkinsonism from Parkinson's disease. There are numerous approaches available to the identification of parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease. The gold standard remains a clinical diagnosis, confirmed by autopsy.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The syndromes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild neurocognitive disorder (MiND), often prodromal to dementia (Major Neurocognitive Disorder), are characterized by acquired clinically significant changes in one or more cognitive domains despite preserved independence. Mild impairment has significant medicolegal consequences for an affected person and their care system. We review the more common etiologies of MiND and provide a systematic review of its medicolegal implications. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed English literature on medicolegal aspects of MCI or MiND using comprehensive search terms and expanding our review to include sources cited by these reports. Results: Impairment of memory, executive function, social cognition, judgment, insight or abstraction can alter an individual’s abilities in a variety of areas that include decision making, informed consent, designation of a surrogate decision-maker such as a health care proxy, understanding and management of financial affairs, execution of a will, or safe driving. Conclusion: Even mild cognitive impairment can have significant behavioral consequences. Clinicians can assist care partners and persons with MCI or MiND by alerting them to the medicolegal concerns that often accompany cognitive decline. Early recognition and discussion can help a care system manage medicolegal risk more effectively and promote thoughtful advance planning.",

Hypotheses about the brain systems underlying these processes can be examined using functional brain imaging.",

      "title": "Screening and a comprehensive special educational diagnostic assessment of five-year-old children with developmental coordination disorder",
      "abstract": "Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself as difficulties in acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills, and difficulties that are manifested as clumsiness as well as slowness and inaccuracy of performance of motor skills. This motor skills deficit significantly and persistently interferes with activities of daily living, and impacts academic/school productivity, prevocational and vocational activities, leisure, and play. Difficulties in specific motor skills performance are long-standing and non-progressive. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period, and motor skills deficits are not better explained by intellectual disability or visual impairment and are not attributable to a neurological condition affecting movement. It occurs in approximately 7% of children, and is more common in boys. It is more common in children with low birth weight, in prematurely born children, and in children with attention disorders, autistic spectrum disorders, or with speech and language disorders. Children with DCD are too often identified in school, and not sooner. \r\nThe main purpose of our quantitative and qualitative research was to identify children with DCD, and apply our comprehensive special educational diagnostic assessment of children with DCD before entering school. \r\nIn the first part of the study, a screening procedure was carried out using 3 tests (the Movement ABC, the Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration and the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire), which included 196 five-year-olds from Ljubljana public kindergartens. \r\nIn our given sample there were 6.6% of children with clinical signs of DCD, 1.5% of them with severe motor problems in terms of DCD. Male to female ratio was 1.6:1. In the borderline DCD group ratio was equal between genders. Results of children with DCD were statistically different from the results of children without DCD in all three tests and in all parts of the tests.\r\nIn the second, qualitative part of the study, 5 case studies involving boys with presumable DCD were analised, based on comprehensive diagnostic assessment using established diagnostic assessment tools, on interviews with parents and professional staff in kindergartens, on the observation and assessment of children's competences in activities of daily living, and on the assessment of children’s individual developmental achievements. \r\nResults showed no specific deviations in term of social factors for the assessed children with DCD. Analysis of the developmental factors, on the other hand, showed different risk factors in early childhood. As expected, the assessed children had problems in gross motor skills, motor planning, lateral dominance, fine motor skills, perception, and in activities of daily living (slowness, difficulties in dressing themselves, in feeding, personal care, and a specific play). Some difficulties were also encountered in individual’s communication, speech and language, some had difficulties in the socio-emotional domain, some with motivation, and some had attention difficulties. Their strengths were in the verbal domain and in cognitive abilities. \r\nBased on our findings, we developed a two-stage model of identification and a comprehensive special educational diagnostic assessment of five-year-old children with DCD. In our final model, the screening process included only the Movement ABC and the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire. A wide range of other diagnostic assessment tools, observation and information received from significant others was included in the later comprehensive diagnostic assessment, for which we proposed a wider range of the team of professionals, that is to take a more interdisciplinary approach. In the end, our research showed a diversity of the DCD phenomenon, an importance of assessing both strengths and difficulties in a child, and a poor insight of child's significant others into his developmental achievements. \r\nFurthermore, some other important and currently not yet researched DCD aspects were found, such as a higher prevalence of girls than expected in a group of children with a borderline DCD, the exceptional psychometric properties of Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire, which was applied to preschool teachers, and finally, the important role of assessing strengths in children with DCD.",

      "abstract": "Unexplained physical signs and symptoms represent a significant portion of patient presentations in acute care settings. Even in cases where a patient presents with a known medical condition, functional or somatic symptoms may complicate the diagnostic and treatment processes and prognostic outcome. One umbrella category for neurologically related somatic symptoms, functional neurological disorder (FND), presents as involuntary neurological symptoms incompatible with another medical condition. Symptoms may include weakness and/or paralysis, movement disorders, non-epileptic seizures, speech or visual impairment, swallowing difficulty, sensory disturbances, or cognitive symptoms (1). While FND presents as neuropsychiatric, providers commonly report feeling hesitant to diagnose these disorders. Inexperience or lack of appropriate education on relevant research regarding evidence-based practices or standard of practice (SOP) may result in over- or underperforming diagnostic workups and consultations, utilizing inappropriate medications, and failing to offer evidence-based psychological interventions. Being mindful of these challenges when treating patients presenting with functional symptoms in acute care settings can help to support and protect the patients and care team and appropriately control healthcare costs.",

One patient had a prominent behavioral (autistic spectrum) presentation and the other a psychiatric (paranoid psychosis) presentation. Both had additional features, such as delayed milestones, ataxia, pyramidal signs, upgaze restriction, or impaired cognition to varying extent, but these were partly subtle or developed later in the disease course.Prominent behavioral or psychiatric features can be the first or most prominent manifestation of ATP13A2-related disease.

Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry.

Various sleep disorders, including long or short sleep duration and poor sleep quality of numerous causes, may increase the risk of diabetes. Some symptoms of diabetes, such as painful peripheral neuropathy and nocturia, or associated other sleep disorders, such as sleep breathing disorders or sleep movement disorders, may influence sleep quality and quantity. Both sleep disorders and diabetes may lead to cognitive impairment. The risk of development of cognitive impairment in diabetic patients may be related to vascular and non-vascular and other factors, such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, central insulin resistance, amyloid and tau deposits and other causes. Numerous sleep disorders, e.g., sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, and poor sleep quality are most likely are also associated with cognitive impairment. Adequate functioning of the system of clearance of the brain from toxic substances, such as amyloid β, i.e. glymphatic system, is related to undisturbed sleep and prevents cognitive impairment.

      "abstract": "Abstract Essential tremor (ET) is a syndrome of tremor in posture and movement, but recent studies have revealed additional cerebellar motor disturbances, cognitive disturbances, personality changes, hearing loss, and olfactory deficits. Even dementia and shortened life expectancy were found in one cohort. Recent postmortem studies have found limited Lewy body pathology in some patients and Purkinje cell loss with torpedoes and Bergmann gliosis in others. These findings have led to the hypothesis that ET is a syndrome produced by at least two neurodegenerative diseases with more widespread clinical consequences than previously appreciated. We review the evidence for and against this hypothesis and conclude that studies purporting to support this hypothesis have failed to control for age‐associated comorbidities, depression, medications, and other confounding factors. We propose the alternative hypothesis that abnormal neuronal oscillation is the fundamental abnormality in ET, and the well‐documented cerebellar signs and symptoms, the controversial non‐motor signs, and even the cerebellar pathology of ET could be caused by this oscillation. A major problem for many studies is the lack of a diagnostic gold standard. Lacking such a standard, we propose a subclassification of ET into three categories: hereditary ET, sporadic ET, and senile ET, which we believe will help researchers resolve many of the controversies in this field. © 2009 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting multiple organ systems. 30-40 % of the patients manifest variable neuropsychiatric symptoms leading to significant morbidity and mortality. CNS involvement could be primary if directly related to SLE activity in the CNS or secondary to treatment, infections, metabolic abnormalities or other systemic manifestations such as hypertension (Futrell et al,1992). Primary NPSLE is divided into focal and diffuse disease. Focal NPSLE is characterized by focal neurologic deficits and is strongly associated with the occurrence of thromboembolic events. Diffuse primary NPSLE is a group of neurologic, psychiatric, and cognitive syndromes that vary from overt neurologic and psychiatric symptoms (eg. seizures, psychosis) to more subtle signs such as headache, mood disturbances, anxiety disorders or mild cognitive dysfunction. Neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE) manifestations can occur in the absence of either serologic activity or other systemic disease manifestations (Sibbit et al., 1999). Thus, in clinical practice the diagnosis of primary NPSLE is rather presumptive, after the exclusion of alternative causes of the neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is no single diagnostic test that is sensitive and specific for SLE-related neuropsychiatric manifestations. The assessment of individual patients is based on clinical, neurologic and rheumatologic evaluation, immunoserologic testing, brain imaging, and psychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. These examinations are used to support or refute the clinical diagnostic impression, rule out alternative explanations, and form the basis for prospective monitoring of clinical evolution and response to treatment interventions. The lack of a diagnostic gold standard makes the correct diagnosis of primary NPSLE a challenge. This realization has led us in developing under the auspices of the European League Against Rheumatology (EULAR) evidence and expert based recommendations for the management of NPSLE (Bertsias et al, 2010).",

      "title": "REM Sleep in Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is mainly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, but the characteristic feature is abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena. REM sleep disturbances can manifest as cataplexy (in narcolepsy type 1), sleep paralysis, sleep-related hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, abnormal dreams, polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep disruption with sleep-onset REM periods, and fragmented REM sleep. Characterization of REM sleep and related symptoms facilitates the differentiation of narcolepsy from other central hypersomnolence disorders and aids in distinguishing between narcolepsy types 1 and 2. A circuit comprising regions within the brainstem, forebrain, and hypothalamus is involved in generating and regulating REM sleep, which is influenced by changes in monoamines, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides. REM sleep is associated with brainstem functions, including autonomic control, and REM sleep disturbances may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Medications used to treat narcolepsy (and REM-related symptoms of narcolepsy) include stimulants/wake-promoting agents, pitolisant, oxybates, and antidepressants; hypocretin agonists are a potential new class of therapeutics. The role of REM sleep disturbances in narcolepsy remains an area of active research in pathophysiology, symptom management, and treatment. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of REM sleep and its dysfunction in narcolepsy.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "abstract": "Musical hallucinations are a particular type of auditory hallucination in which the patient perceives instrumental music, musical sounds, or songs. Musical hallucinations are associated with acquired hearing loss, particularly within the elderly. Under conditions of reduced auditory sensory input, perception-bearing circuits are disinhibited and perceptual traces released, implying an interaction between peripheral sensory deficits and central factors related to brain dysfunction.A 71-year-old Caucasian man with hearing loss complained of memory difficulties and resting tremor of the right upper limb in the previous 2 years. He already had difficulties in instrumental activities of daily life. Neurological examination showed Parkinsonian signs and hypoacusia. Neuropsychological examination identified deficits in executive functions and memory tests. Brain computerized tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance scans showed mild cortical and subcortical atrophy. The clinical diagnosis of possible dementia with Lewy bodies was established. Five years later, the patient began complaining of musical hallucinations. There had been no previous change in medication. An otorhinolaryngologist diagnosed age-related hearing loss and prescribed bilateral hearing aids. After using the hearing aids, the patient did not hear the songs any longer, only some tinnitus, described as a whistle. However, at the same time, the patient started experiencing visual hallucinations he never had before.To our knowledge, the immediate shift of hallucinations from one sensory modality to another sensory modality when perception is improved has not been previously described. This report emphasizes the interaction between brain pathology and sensory deficits for the genesis of hallucinations, and reinforces the theory that attention and control networks must couple properly to the default mode network, as well as integrate and select adequately peripheral signals to the somatosensory cortices, in order to keep a clear state of mind.The clinician should bear in mind and let the patient know that improving one sensory modality to ameliorate hallucinations may sometimes paradoxically lead to hallucinations in a different sensory modality.",

Fluctuation in cognitive state either in the form of episodic confusional states resembling delirium or transient periods of reduced or loss of consciousness, superimposed on a background variability is described in 80% of patients in some series. This fluctuation of cognition may be less marked in those LBD cases who most resemble AD.",

      "title": "Driving Ability among Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: Can Legislation Be Provided on the Matter?",
      "abstract": "Background−Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition with relapsing periods of neurological disabilities which is often followed by a progressive stage of disability accumulation. Depending upon the area where demyelination has occurred, the neurological manifestations vary: patients may be visually impaired with adequate motor function or have normal vision with tetraparesis, for example. Likewise, they may have good coordination and cognitive dysfunction or lack of coordination and adequate cognitive abilities. Multiple sclerosis typically affects young adults who may be willing to drive and may be completely fit or partially/totally unfit to do so. Methods−The authors performed a systematic review of the literature using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement. Results−Twenty-seven papers on the subject were identified. The majority of these papers agree that MS may negatively influence the ability to drive, particularly when patients have physical and/or cognitive and/or emotional disabilities. The heterogeneity of methods and assessments in these papers make it difficult to draw conclusions and so aid clear legislation on the subject. Conclusion−There is no specific literature on driving abilities in patients with MS that assists in creating legislation.",

      "abstract": "Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects more than 1% of the population aged over 65 years and manifests with both motor symptoms – bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity, and non-motor symptoms. Cognitive impairment and dementia are recognized non-motor symptoms that can significantly affect the quality of life of both the patient and caregivers and are a risk factor for institutionalization in nursing homes and a risk factor for early mortality. Cognitive impairment is frequent in Parkinson’s disease (PD) that can develop even before the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease based on its motor features. Conclusions: There are several clinical, molecular, and imaging factors that constitute risk factors for the development of Parkinson’s disease dementia, in which basal cholinergic and prefrontal dopaminergic systems are involved. Histological changes are Lewy-body, Alzheimer, but also vascular pathology. Clinically can be distinguished subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment and, subsequently, Parkinson’s disease dementia. There are no remedies with a proven effect to prevent the occurrence of cognitive decline in PD. The only approved drug for already developed D-PD is the cholinesterase inhibitor – donepezil. Non-pharmacological interventions are thought to be beneficial. A multidisciplinary approach to cognitive impairment is recommended, with specific pharmaceutical treatment of the cognitive disorder and comorbidities, and appropriate rehabilitation.",

Studies showed that several non-motor symptoms, such as olfactory dysfunction, constipation, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, depression and fatigue, can occur before the onset of motor symptoms. Fatigue has been considered as one of the most disabling symptoms, and it has a significant impact on activity of daily living and quality of life, and brings heavy burdens to caregivers.

      "abstract": "Subjective sleepiness is defined as \"an elemental feeling state\" by which the subject, and only him/her knows whether he/she is alert or sleepy. Subjective sleepiness has little been used for the clinical evaluation of sleepiness. Objective sleepiness is defined as a consequence of the homeostatic need for sleep. In the absence of a measurable marker of the fulfillment of the function of sleep, the evaluation of objective sleepiness has to rely on a behavioral approach based on the postulate that the more you need sleep (i.e., the sleepier you are), the more likely you are to fall asleep. However, as for many other fundamental human behaviors (drinking, eating, sexual behavior), it is likely that the sleeping behavior serves other purposes than its primary objective, which distorts the relationship between the observed sleeping behavior and the actual need for sleep. The likelihood to fall asleep can be measured by the speed with which a sleep episode occurs under standardized laboratory conditions (multiple sleep latency test, maintenance of wakefulness test, OSLER test), or by the frequency of unwanted sleep episodes under the more naturalistic conditions of daily life (Epworth Sleepiness Scale). These various approaches have advantages and drawbacks, but none of them can be considered the \"gold standard\".",

      "abstract": "The author fundamentally questions the traditional concept of the disease-entity (or several disease entities) of 'schizophrenia' and discusses an alternative concept, based on vulnerability and information-processing. According to this, schizophrenia-like psychotic phenomena develop in three phases. In the first, premorbid phase, combined biological (genetic and possibly other organic) and psycho-social influences lead to a premorbid 'vulnerability', characterised by a low tolerance of cognitive and emotional stress, corresponding to an insufficient capacity for the adequate processing of complex information. In the second phase, stressful life-events can lead to unique or repeated acute productive psychotic episodes. The third phase, that of long-term evolution, depends more on psycho-social influences than on biological factors. Under unfavourable conditions, it may lead to predominantly unproductive residual states of various degrees, which can largely be understood as regulatory mechanisms to restrict stressful over-stimulation. There is no clearly delimitable disease entity of schizophrenia with constant causes, psychopathological picture, or course, but rather a multi-conditioned life-process, occurring in people with a particular vulnerability, interacting with complex life-events and circumstances. This new concept has important consequences for therapy and prevention.",

While the relationship between sleep and neurodegenerative disease is likely bidirectional, sleep disturbances often predate the onset of other hallmark clinical symptoms. Neuronal waste clearance is significantly more efficient during sleep; thus, disturbed sleep may lead to the accumulation of neuronal proteins that underlie neurodegenerative diseases. Key pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases include an accumulation of misfolded or misprocessed variants of amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, alpha synuclein (α-syn), and TarDNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43). While the presence of fibrillar protein aggregates of these neuronal proteins are characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases, the presence of small soluble toxic oligomeric variants of these different proteins likely precedes the formation of the hallmark aggregates.",

Because the basis of normal brain function is not sufficiently understood, the basis of abnormal function is understood poorly. Even in disorders where the fundamental biochemical defect is known, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and other enzyme defects, the exact basis for brain dysfunction is uncertain. The outcome for treated PKU, galactosemia, homocystinuria, and lysosomal disorders is not yet optimal. The various forms of nonketotic hyperglycinemia often respond poorly to current therapy. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures, such as deficient synthesis of serine or creatine and impaired glucose transport into the brain, and disorders with variable malformations, such as Smith‐Lemli‐Opitz (SLO) syndrome and the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures and disorders with variable malformations may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Simple tests of urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid may lead to a diagnosis, accurate genetic counseling, and better treatment.

Firstly, the clinical presentation of a dementia disorder, especially in the elderly, may involve features consistent with the clinical diagnostic guidelines for the syndrome of dementia with Lewy bodies, including fluctuating cognitive performance, visual hallucination and mild features of parkinsonism. Secondly, patients with an established neurological diagnosis of Parkinson's disease have an increased risk of developing dementia during their illness. At these extremes the clinical diagnoses are distinct, but many patients are encountered who are less easy to classify clinically. Throughout this spectrum the pathological features of brain and peripheral nerve disease are overlapping and do not provide the basis for clear-cut syndromic diagnoses. Cognitive impairment in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia is associated with more extensive anatomical spread of α-synucleinopathy in the brain and variable, often extensive, Alzheimer type pathology.

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

Few (39%) F-PN patients had motor nerve conduction abnormalities, but the majority showed proximal conduction abnormalities in somatosensory evoked potentials (80%), and all had focal hypertrophy and/or increased short tau inversion recovery image signal intensity on plexus MRI. Impairment remained monomelic in most (94%) F-PN patients, whereas abnormalities developed in other limbs in 57% of F-SMN, and 40% of F-MN patients (P = .015). The prognosis of F-PN patients was significantly better: none had an ONLS score > 2 at the final follow-up visit, vs 43% of F-SMN patients and 40% of F-MN patients (P = .026). Our findings from a large cohort of focal CIDP patients confirm the existence of different entities that are typically categorized under this one term: on the one hand, patients with a focal plexus neuropathy and on the other, patients with monomelic sensori-motor or motor involvement of peripheral nerves. These two last subgroups appeared to be more likely to evolve to LSS or MMN phenotype, when F-PN patients have a more distinctive long-term, focal, benign course.",

      "abstract": "A 13 year adolescent boy presented with complaints of progressive loss of speech and seizure disorder for the past 1 year. The boy was developmently normal before the onset of illness. There was history of subtle trauma to head. He started communicating with signs followed by paucity of speech progressed to complete aphasia and abnormal behavior in the form of burst of aggressiveness and hyperactivity. Boy had partial, generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurred during sleep. Mental status examination revealed abnormal behaviour, attention deficits, auditory agnosia and aphasia (both expressive and receptive). All relevant investigations including BERA were normal. EEG showed repetitive spikes and wave activity in bilateral parietooccipital regions during nonrapid eye movement. Clinical features and EEG led to a diagnosis of Landau Kleffner Syndrome. He was started on Lamotrigine, steroid and speech therapy. The boy started showing improvement of symptoms in form of understanding of short sentences.

      "abstract": "Mood disorders are characterized by abnormalities of mood and affect regulation, cognitive changes, motor activity alterations, sleep abnormalities, appetite changes, and other disturbances of homeostatic/drive states (e.g., libido, motivation). Although the etiology of mood disorders in most patients is \"idiopathic,\" neuropsychiatric disorders are commonly associated with disturbances of mood and affect, especially depressive syndromes. A growing literature supports a similar neurobiological basis for mood disorders, regardless of etiology. However, rather than defining a single causative \"lesion\" or neurochemical abnormality, current models propose an integrated set of distinct but interconnected neural systems underlying the phenomenological features of mood disorders. Each of these systems may be more or less disturbed, resulting in variable symptomatic presentation and treatment response. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], and bipolar disorder) are a pervasive and costly public health concern. Mood disorders have a 12-month prevalence rate of about 10% and a lifetime prevalence rate of about 20%. Mental and behavioral disorders, especially major depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability in the United States and present a significant economic burden nationally and globally. Current and developing mood disorder treatments are based on the complex interplay of anatomy, biochemistry, and phenomenology of mood disorders. By analogy, the treatments for many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), vary depending on the paradigm on which an intervention is based, such as biochemistry (e.g., dopamine agonists, enzyme inhibitors, anticholinergic medication), anatomy, or neurocircuitry (e.g., ablation, deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Similarly, greater acknowledgment of the intricate neurobiology of mood disorders will likely generate many diverse and hopefully effective treatments.",

La presencia conduce a deterioro fisico y cognitivo del paciente, en relacion al componete cognitivo los factores mas reportadas son deficits en funciones ejecutivas, atencion, velocidad de procesamiento, habilidades visoespaciales y memoria, pocos estudios han reportado las alteraciones que presentan los pacientes con EM en aspectos del lenguaje, especificamente en el componente pragmatico, referido como la comprension de aspectos del significado de enunciados emitidos de los cuales no se puede obtener informacion de la intencion del hablante por una referencia directa o el lenguaje literal. En la literatura ha sugerido que las fallas en el componente pragmatico subyacen a la interaccion de otros dominios cognitivos. Existen 2 modelos que intentan explicar esta hipotesis identificando por un lado a las Funciones Ejecutivas (FE) y por otro a las Habilidades Visoespaciales (HV) en otras poblaciones como demencia tipo Alzheimer, siendo estas funciones tipicamente alteradas en EM. El objetivo del trabajo es examinar el rol de los componentes cognitivos involucrados en el deficit del funcionamiento pragmatico de pacientes con EM. Se realizara un estudio transversal correlacional, participaran 30 pacientes con EM remitente recurrente, se evaluara su desempeno en tareas de FE, HV y pragmatica utilizando la Bateria Neuropsicologica de Screening en Esclerosis Multiple y el Protocolo para la Evaluacion de la Comunicacion de Montreal. Los resultados de las dos evaluaciones se correlacionaran con el objetivo de identificar la relacion entre FE, HV y el componente de pragmatica para determinar si las alteraciones presentadas por los pacientes podrian estar permeadas por la funcion de otros dominios cognitivos.",

      "abstract": "Motor neglect is characterized by underutilization of one side of the body when this failure cannot be attributed to primary sensory and motor defects. Impaired motor activity manifests itself in disturbance of using spontaneously contralesional limbs in the absence of severe hemiplegia (motor neglect) or in reduced readiness to initiate and carry out intact ipsilesional arm movements within or towards the contralesional hemispace (pre-motor neglect). These specific higher-order motor deficits may occur in isolation (pure motor neglect) or as part of a more pervasive neglect syndrome involving disturbances in visual, auditory, and tactile modalities or even in mental images. The lesions underlying the motor variant of hemi-neglect are ascribed to various topographic sites of the brain involving cortical and subcortical structures of the right or, rarely, the left hemisphere. Motor features of neglect are more frequent, more severe and long-lasting in right--as compared with left--brain-damaged patients. This deficit additionally makes improvement and neurorehabilitation of patients with focal brain damage difficult.",

      "abstract": "Malformations of cortical development (MCDs) are a common cause of epilepsy, although seizures are not always the most prominent neurologic manifestation of these disorders. In localization-related epilepsy, certain features should create a strong suspicion that an MCD is the underlying cause; these include developmental delay and static focal neurologic deficits, a family history of developmental delay or epilepsy, frequent seizures from onset, and episodes of focal status epilepticus. MCDs can be classified according to a number of different criteria emphasizing clinical phenotype, imaging findings, pathology, or genetic defects. The overall classification of MCDs is based on the 3 fundamental events of cortical formation: 1) proliferation of neurons and glia in the ventricular and subventricular zones; 2) multidirectional migration of immature but postmitotic neurons to the developing cerebral cortex; and 3) cortical organization. Among the most common and distinct syndromes and entities affecting patients with MCDs and epilepsy are focal cortical dysplasia, hemimegalencephaly, tuberous sclerosis, classical lissencephaly, periventricular nodular heterotopia, focal subcortical heterotopia, polymicrogyria, and schizencephaly, all of which are discussed herein.",

Esta revisión describe las características clínicas de la EP con énfasis en aquellas que diferencian la enfermedad de otros trastornos parkinsonianos. Debido a que no existe una prueba definitiva para el diagnóstico de la EP, la enfermedad debe diagnosticarse con base en criterios clínicos. El temblor en reposo, la bradicinesia, la rigidez y la pérdida de los reflejos posturales se consideran generalmente los signos cardinales de la EP. La presencia y la presentación específica de estas características se utilizan para diferenciar la EP de los trastornos parkinsonianos relacionados. Otras características clínicas incluyen síntomas motores secundarios (por ejemplo: Hipomimia, disartria, disfagia, sialorrea, micrografía, marcha arrastrando los pies, festinación, congelación, distonía, reflejos glabelares), síntomas no motores (por ejemplo: Disfunción autonómica, anomalías cognitivas / neuroconductuales, trastornos del sueño y anomalías sensoriales como anosmia, parestesias y dolor). La ausencia de temblor en reposo, la aparición temprana de dificultad para caminar, la inestabilidad postural, la demencia, las alucinaciones y la presencia de disautonomía, oftalmoparesia, ataxia y otras características atípicas, junto con una respuesta deficiente o nula a la levodopa, sugieren diagnósticos distintos de la EP. Un conocimiento profundo del amplio espectro de manifestaciones clínicas de la EP es fundamental para el diagnóstico adecuado de la enfermedad. Las mutaciones o variantes genéticas, las anomalías en la neuroimagen y otras pruebas son biomarcadores potenciales que pueden mejorar el diagnóstico y permitir la identificación de personas en riesgo.",

      "title": "Practical approach to the patient with acute neuromuscular weakness",
      "abstract": "Acute neuromuscular paralysis (ANMP) is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapid onset muscle weakness progressing to maximum severity within several days to weeks (less than 4 wk). Bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness may or may not be present. It is a common neurological emergency which requires immediate and careful investigations to determine the etiology because accurate diagnosis has significant impact on therapy and prognosis. Respiratory failure caused by neuromuscular weakness is considered as more critical than lung disease because its development may be insidious or subtle until sudden decompensation leads to life threatening hypoxia. Also, the arterial blood gas finding of severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis may not be apparent until respiratory failure is profound. Hence, the requirement for respiratory assistance should also be intensively and promptly investigated in all patients with neuromuscular disease. The disorder is classified based on the site of defect in motor unit pathway, i.e., anterior horn cells, nerve root, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction or muscle. Identification of the cause is primarily based on a good medical history and detailed clinical examination supplemented with neurophysiologic investigations and sometimes few specific laboratory tests. Medical history and neurological examination should be focused on the onset, progression, pattern and severity of muscle weakness as well as cranial nerves testing and tests for autonomic dysfunction. Associated non neurological features like fever, rash or other skin lesions etc. should also be noted. Globally, Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most frequent cause of ANMP and accounts for the majority of cases of respiratory muscles weakness associated with neuromuscular disorders. Newly acquired neuromuscular weakness in intensive care unit patients consist of critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy and drug induced neuromuscular weakness which may arise as a consequence of sepsis, multi-organ failure, and exposure to certain medications like intravenous corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents.",

The notion of confusional arousals in children has received less attention overall compared with that concerning adults. The impression gained in adults is that, especially in response to forced awakenings, the behavioral disturbance in adult episodes is more forceful, vigorous and resistive, sometimes leading to violent behavior. Childhood confusional arousals do not usually require treatment, only advice to parents that they can be considered to be a passing phase. The same cannot necessarily be said of confusional arousals in adult life when they have more of a tendency to persist, depending on their etiology and relationship to other sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "The perception of eye gaze is crucial for social interaction, providing essential information about another person's goals, intentions, and focus of attention. People with schizophrenia suffer a wide range of social cognitive deficits, including abnormalities in eye gaze perception. For instance, patients have shown an increased bias to misjudge averted gaze as being directed toward them. In this study we probed early unconscious mechanisms of gaze processing in schizophrenia using a technique known as continuous flash suppression. Previous research using this technique to render faces with direct and averted gaze initially invisible reveals that direct eye contact gains privileged access to conscious awareness in healthy adults. We found that patients, as with healthy control subjects, showed the same effect: faces with direct eye gaze became visible significantly faster than faces with averted gaze. This suggests that early unconscious processing of eye gaze is intact in schizophrenia and implies that any misjudgments of gaze direction must manifest at a later conscious stage of gaze processing where deficits and/or biases in attributing mental states to gaze and/or beliefs about being watched may play a role.",

The chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathies are less severe, and less distinctive. Their recognition depends on eliciting a history of earlier classical manifestations of Lyme disease and by laboratory testing. In both acute and chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathy, electrophysiologic testing often proves the presence of a sensorimotor, axon loss polyradiculoneuropathy. Both acute and chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathy have similar pathologic features and can be classified as a nonvasculitic mononeuritis multiplex. The pathogenesis is uncertain; both direct infection as well as parainfectious mechanisms may play a role. The treatment with which we have the most experience is intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g/day for 2 to 4 weeks. Improvement occurs rapidly over days to weeks in early Lyme neuroborreliosis, but slowly over many months in chronic neuroborreliosis.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating mental illness characterized by an early onset and chronic course. Evidence from several lines of research suggests significant neuropsychological deficits in patients with OCD; executive dysfunction and nonverbal memory deficits have been reported consistently in OCD. These deficits persist despite controlling potential confounders such as comorbidity, severity of illness, and medications. Neuropsychological impairments are independent of illness severity, thus suggesting that the neuropsychological deficits are trait markers of the disease. In addition, these deficits are seen in first-degree relatives of individuals with OCD. These reports suggest that neuropsychological deficits are potential endophenotype markers in OCD. Neuropsychological studies in pediatric OCD are limited; they show impairments of small effect size across multiple domains but with doubtful clinical significance. Preliminary evidence shows that different symptom dimensions of OCD may have unique neuropsychological deficits suggestive of discrete but overlapping neuroanatomical regions for individual symptom dimensions. Overall, neuropsychological deficits further support the role of frontostriatal circuits in the neurobiology of OCD. In addition, emerging literature also suggests the important role of other areas, in particular parietal cortex. Preliminary evidence suggests the possible role of neuropsychological deficits to be markers of treatment response but needs to be examined in future. Longitudinal studies with examination of patients at different time points and examination of their potential utility as predictors of treatment response are needed in future.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease with motor, cognitive, and other neuropsychiatric manifestations. Cognitive symptoms include impairments in attention, information processing efficiency and speed, executive functions, and long-term memory. Cognitive impairments are independent of the duration of the disease and are very little associated with neurological manifestations. Most MS patients need psychiatric treatment, usually for a cognitive or an affective disorder. Therapeutic management includes treatment of acute exacerbations, symptomatic treatment, and disease-modifying treatment/biological therapies. This case presentation aims to emphasize the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists when facing the psychiatric manifestations of MS. Our patient is a 52-years old man who presented to our clinic with suicidal ideation with plan and method, depressive mood, multiple delusions, affective inversion towards family members, severe anxiety, and irritability, symptoms that led to significantly diminished functionality. He also presents neurological symptoms with severe damage to the motor area. MS is a chronic, progressive disease with well-known neurological symptoms. However, the psychiatric manifestations are often overlooked. MS is thought to be an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks the myelin sheath that protects nerve fibers, resulting in inflammation and damage, eventually leading to a loss of function. The psychiatric manifestations of MS can be just as debilitating as the physical symptoms and significantly reduce the quality of life. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach between specialists in psychiatry and neurology is often needed to provide patients with the most appropriate medical care.",

      "title": "Peripheral Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Peripheral neuropathy describes the clinical syndrome of weakness, sensory loss, diminished tendon reflexes, or some combination of these findings caused by lesions of peripheral nerves. It may symmetrically involve the distal extremities, usually lower extremity greater than upper extremity (distal sensory, motor, or sensorimotor polyneuropathy), or may involve one or more named nerves (mononeuritis or mononeuritis multiplex). Peripheral neuropathy can also involve nerve roots (polyradiculopathy). From a pathophysiologic perspective, peripheral neuropathies are commonly divided into axonal and demyelinating types. Axonal neuropathy primarily destroys the axon, with secondary loss of the myelin sheath. Nerve conduction velocities are commonly normal with axonal neuropathy, but the sensory or motor amplitudes are low. Demyelinating neuropathy is associated with loss of the myelin sheath but preservation of the axon. Nerve conduction velocities are slowed, but the amplitudes are normal with this type of neuropathy. From a clinical standpoint, four main types of peripheral neuropathy occur among HIV-infected persons: (1) distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN), (2) acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP and CIDP), (3) mononeuritis or mononeuritis multiplex (MM), and (4) lumbosacral polyradiculopathy (LSPR). With HIV-infected patients, the type of neuropathy depends in part on the degree of their immunodeficiency. Patients with AIDP and CIDP more often have early stage HIV disease. Distal sensory neuropathy, the most common form of neuropathy, generally develops in patients with more advanced, or late stage HIV disease. Similarly, LSPR predominantly occurs in patients who have progressed to AIDS. Mononeuritis or limited MM can develop in early stage HIV disease; extensive neuritis is seen in late stage HIV disease and may resemble CIDP.",

      "title": "Long-term Cognitive and Functional Impairments After Critical Illness",
      "abstract": "As critical illness survivorship increases, patients and health care providers are faced with management of long-term sequelae including cognitive and functional impairment. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated impairments persisting at least 1–5 years after hospitalization for critical illness. Cognitive domains impacted include memory, attention, and processing speed. Functional impairments include physical weakness, reduced endurance, and dependence on others for basic tasks of daily living such as bathing or feeding. In characterizing the trajectory of long-term recovery, multiple risk factors have been identified for subsequent impairment, including increased severity of illness and severe sepsis, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and delirium. Preadmission status including frailty, high level of preexisting comorbidities, and baseline cognitive dysfunction are also associated with impairment after critical illness. Development of cognitive and functional impairment is likely multifactorial, and multiple mechanistic theories have been proposed. Neuroinflammation, disruption of the blood–brain barrier, and structural alterations in the brain have all been observed in patients with long-term cognitive dysfunction. Systemic inflammation has also been associated with alterations in muscle integrity and function, which is associated with intensive care unit–acquired weakness and prolonged functional impairment. Efforts to ease the burden of long-term impairments include prevention strategies and rehabilitation interventions after discharge. Delirium is a well-established risk factor for long-term cognitive dysfunction, and using delirium-prevention strategies may be important for cognitive protection. Current evidence favors minimizing overall sedation exposure, careful selection of sedation agents including avoidance of benzodiazepines, and targeted sedation goals to avoid oversedation. Daily awakening and spontaneous breathing trials and early mobilization have shown benefit in both cognitive and functional outcomes. Multifactorial prevention bundles are useful tools in improving care provided to patients in the intensive care unit. Data regarding cognitive rehabilitation are limited, while studies on functional rehabilitation have conflicting results. Continued investigation and implementation of prevention strategies and rehabilitation interventions will hopefully improve the quality of life for the ever-increasing population of critical illness survivors.",

Recent findings Lyme facial palsy remains the most common manifestation of Lyme neuroborreliosis. Recent investigations show likely evidence of vagal involvement in Lyme disease. Summary The literature on Lyme neuroborreliosis continues to evolve. Lyme disease can affect nearly any cranial nerve in addition to causing various headache syndromes. The most common manifestation is Lyme disease facial palsy, occurring in up to 5–10% of patients with documented Lyme disease. Headache syndromes are common in the context of facial palsy but can occur in isolation, and more specific headache syndromes including trigeminal and geniculate neuralgias can occur rarely. Signs and symptoms indicative of vestibulocochlear nerve involvement are relatively common, although it could be that these represent other vestibular involvement rather than a specific cranial neuropathy. Optic neuritis is a controversial entity within Lyme disease and is likely overdiagnosed, but convincing cases do exist. Physicians who see any cranial neuropathy, including optic neuritis, in an endemic area can consider Lyme disease as a possible cause.",

      "title": "Epilepsy after Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Clinicians are commonly confronted with the differential diagnosis of altered mental status, impaired cognition and altered level of consciousness in hospitalized patients including those admitted to medical, geriatric, emergency, intensive and post-operative care units. Although delirium is the most common acute neuropsychiatric condition in the acute hospital setting this diagnosis is commonly delayed, made too late or missed altogether. Difficulties and importance of timely diagnosis The causes of delirious states are manifold. Both, direct damage to the brain tissue as well as encephalopathy as a result of other medical diseases, can be the cause of delirium. Depending on the predisposition delirious syndromes can be provoked by minor medical interventions. Clinical presentation is very variable, but remains largely independent of the triggering mechanisms. Purely catatonic, hypoactive, hyperactive and excitatory types as well as mixed forms can be distinguished. Immediate diagnosis of a delirious syndrome and rapid elucidation of its causes are keys for the implementation of curative therapy. There is a need to act fast because delirious phases are associated with significantly longer hospital stay and increased morbidity as a result of long-term cognitive deficits as well as increased mortality. As negative outcome is closely linked to the duration of a delirious episode, early diagnosis and rapid termination of the delirium constitute a significant positive predictor of outcome. In this respect, delirium represents an emergency, with or without concomitant cerebral or extracerebral symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia in older people that has only been recognized in the past decade and that remains widely underdiagnosed. At postmortem examination, affected patients show numerous α-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies (LB) in many parts of the cerebral cortex, particularly neocortical and limbic areas in addition to the nigral LB degeneration characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinical presentation, unlike PD, is with progressive cognitive decline with particular deficits of visuospatial ability as well as frontal executive function accompanied by usually only mildly to moderately severe parkinsonism, which is often akineto-rigid without the classical parkinsonian rest-tremor. Further accompanying features include spontaneous recurrent visual hallucinations and conspicuous fluctuations in alertness and cognitive performance. The two main differential diagnoses are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). To improve the differential diagnosis of DLB, consensus criteria have been developed that establish possible and probable levels of clinical diagnostic accuracy. Generally, their sensitivity is variable and low but their specificity is high. Current consensus is to restrict a diagnosis of DLB only to patients with parkinsonism who develop dementia within 12 months of the onset of motor symptoms. Using operationalized criteria, DLB can be diagnosed clinically with an accuracy similar to that achieved for AD or PD. Ancillary investigations, particularly neuroimaging, can aid in differential diagnosis. We review the present state of the best practice in the clinical diagnosis of DLB. Future modifications of diagnostic criteria would ideally include the full range of clinical presentations that can be associated with LB disease. © 2005 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) is composed of cellular components organized in a complex structure that is unlike other organ systems. At the macroscopic level, the parenchyma of the CNS can be categorized into two structurally and functionally unique components: gray and white matter. The CNS can be divided into a number of anatomic regions, each with specific neurologic or cognitive functions. Disease or damage to these regions produces neurologic or cognitive deficits that correlate with the anatomic location and extent of disease. There are several ways to divide these structures. The main divisions are the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Developmental neuropathology encompasses a broad variety of cerebral malformations and functional impairments caused by disturbances of brain development, manifesting during ages from the embryonic period through adolescence and young adulthood. The neurologic and psychiatric manifestations of neurodevelopmental disorders range widely depending on the affected neural systems and include such diverse manifestations as epilepsy, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, breathing disorders, ataxia, autism, and schizophrenia. In terms of morbidity and mortality, the spectrum is extremely broad: the mildest neurodevelopmental disorders can be asymptomatic, whereas the worst malformations often lead to intrauterine or neonatal demise. This chapter focuses on the genetic disorders of brain development, caused by mutations of gene loci or chromosomal regions with important neurodevelopmental functions.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are abnormal behavioral or physiological events that intrude into the sleep process disrupting its continuity. Parasomnia associated to REM sleep include REM sleep behavior disorder, nightmare disorders, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (SP), and sleep-related painful erections. The quality of life of patients suffering from parasomnias may vary according to the disorder. REM sleep behavior disorder patients experience recurrent vivid and violent dreams and frequent sleep-related injuries for themselves or bed partners, with possible impacts on personal, couple, and social life. Despite the possible awakening from REM sleep, sleep architecture is usually preserved in RBD. Idiopathic RBD may often precede a neurodegenerative disease, and its diagnosis might imply a psychological burden for patients and their family. The increased risk for neurodegenerative illnesses poses the ethical dilemma whether the patient should or should not be told about, especially in view of the current lack of effective neuroprotective strategies and the lack of knowledge about the precise extent of this risk. Nightmares are intensely disturbing dreams involving a variety of dysphoric emotions, most often fear and anxiety. Nightmares have been correlated to various measures of psychopathology, namely neuroticism, anxiety, depression, but not all studies support this relationship. Personality factors, such as nightmare frequency, nightmare distress (ND), and coping style, appear to be important in modulating the clinical severity of nightmare disorder. Parasomnias, especially nightmare and SP, can lead to postawakening anxiety with difficulty returning to sleep, sleep avoidance, and sleep deprivation, with subsequent insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and intensification of the parasomnia REM-rebound related.",

      "title": "Narcolepsy and rapid eye movement sleep",
      "abstract": "Since the first description of narcolepsy at the end of the 19th Century, great progress has been made. The disease is nowadays distinguished as narcolepsy type 1 and type 2. In the 1960s, the discovery of rapid eye movement sleep at sleep onset led to improved understanding of core sleep-related disease symptoms of the disease (excessive daytime sleepiness with early occurrence of rapid eye movement sleep, sleep-related hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rapid eye movement parasomnia), as possible dysregulation of rapid eye movement sleep, and cataplexy resembling an intrusion of rapid eye movement atonia during wake. The relevance of non-sleep-related symptoms, such as obesity, precocious puberty, psychiatric and cardiovascular morbidities, has subsequently been recognized. The diagnostic tools have been improved, but sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods on polysomnography and Multiple Sleep Latency Test remain key criteria. The pathogenic mechanisms of narcolepsy type 1 have been partly elucidated after the discovery of strong HLA class II association and orexin/hypocretin deficiency, a neurotransmitter that is involved in altered rapid eye movement sleep regulation. Conversely, the causes of narcolepsy type 2, where cataplexy and orexin deficiency are absent, remain unknown. Symptomatic medications to treat patients with narcolepsy have been developed, and management has been codified with guidelines, until the recent promising orexin-receptor agonists. The present review retraces the steps of the research on narcolepsy that linked the features of the disease with rapid eye movement sleep abnormality, and those that do not appear associated with rapid eye movement sleep.",

Disturbances in body image of delusional proportions were present in all patients. This is an important diagnostic and prognostic sign. Disturbance in the accuracy of perception or recognition of bodily states is the second pathognomic sign. Failure to recognize signs of nutritional needs is the outstanding aspect. The paradoxical overactivity of these patients is related to the same cognitive deficit. The third characteristic these patients had in common, an all-pervading sense of ineffectiveness, is of more general significance. It is the outcome of a personality development with a deficit of confirmation of child-initiated behavior. \"Insight-giving\" psychotherapy is ineffective. Evoking awareness of impulses originating within the patient is essential if the treatment is to succeed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Perhaps no other organ in the body is affected as often and in as many ways as the brain is in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Several factors contribute to the neurological disorders in CKD including accumulation of uremic toxins, metabolic and hemodynamic disorders, oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired blood brain barrier among others. The neurological disorders in CKD involve both peripheral and central nervous system. The peripheral neurological symptoms of CKD are due to somatic and cranial peripheral neuropathies as well as a myopathy. The central neurological symptoms of CKD are due to the cortical predominantly cortical, or subcortical lesions. Cognitive decline, encephalopathy, cortical myoclonus, asterixis and epileptic seizures are distinct features of the cortical disorders of CKD. Diffuse white matter disease due to ischemia and hypoxia may be an important cause of subcortical encephalopathy. A special and more benign form of subcortical disorder caused by brain edema in CKD is termed posterior reversible encephalopathy. Subcortical pathology especially when it affects the basal ganglia causes a number of movement disorders including Parkinsonism, chorea and dystonia. A stimulus‐sensitive reflex myoclonus is believed to originate from the medullary structures. Sleep disorder and restless leg syndrome are common in CKD and have both central and peripheral origin. This article provides an overview of the available data on the nature, prevalence, pathophysiology, consequences and treatment of neurological complications of CKD.",

      "title": "Djinnati Syndrome in Baluchistan: The Role of Traumatic and Abuse Experiences on Individual Vulnerability",
      "abstract": "is a culture-bound syndrome in Baluchestan, Iran. Experts believe that dissociation theory is more suitable for providing a psychopathological description of this syndrome in this region. In addition, they highlight need for investigating its pathology, particularly role of factors such as traumatic and abuse experiences during childhood.\r\n\r\nAccording to 4th edition of diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (1), the essential feature of dissociative disorders is a disruption in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception of environment. The disturbance may be sudden or gradual, transient or chronic. According to DSM-IV-TR, dissociative disorders include: dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue and unspecified dissociative disorder. A dissociate disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) is a disorder that includes a dissociative symptom (i.e. disturbance in usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity or perception of environment), that does not meet criteria for any specific dissociative disorder.\r\n\r\nIn addition, according to DSM a dissociative state may be defined as a dissociative trance disorder that includes a possession or trance state. Dissociative trance disorder is a single or episodic disturbance in state of consciousness, identity, or memory that are indigenous to particular locations and cultures. Dissociative trance involves narrowing of awareness of immediate surroundings or stereotyped behaviors or movements that are experienced as being beyond one’s control. Possession trance involves replacement of customary sense of personal identity or a new identity, attributed to influence of a spirit, power, deity, or other person, and is associated with stereotyped “involuntary” movements or amnesia. It is probably most prevalent dissociative disorder in Asia. The dissociative or trance disorder is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice.\r\n\r\nMany culture-related syndromes, such as amok, bebainan, latah, pibloktoq, ataque de nervios and possession, shin-byung, enchantment, lack of spirit, Zar and djinnati (2, 3), are considered as dissociative disorders. Culture-bound syndromes include a set of psychological phenomena that are of interest to psychologists and psychiatrists. The eclectic nature of this syndrome has made it difficult to have a precise definition. Thus, deciding on a specific definition has been controversial. According to DSM, term culture-bound syndrome denotes a locality-specific pattern and repetition of an aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be illnesses, or at least afflictions that mostly have local names. Culture-bound syndromes do not one-by-one match routine diagnostic system diseases. Most of these syndromes were initially reported as an issue specific to a certain culture or a relevant set, or geographically-related to original culture (4).\r\n\r\nThe term Djinnati is a culture-bound syndrome, widely known by that name in Iranian and Pakistani Baluchestan (3, 5). Based on clinical observations, this syndrome was introduced by Bakhshani and Kianpoor in Baluchestan, Iran (6). A new study by Bakhshani et al. (3) on a rural population in Baluchestan showed total prevalence of 0.5% and 1.03% among rural population and women of that population, respectively. Common symptoms of this disorder include disruption in consciousness, memory and stereotyped behaviors such as laughing, crying, speaking incomprehensibly, which are attributed to a new identity known as Djinn. Attacks usually begin with pain, irritation and sometimes limb paralysis. In some groups, loss of speech and in some other cases, speaking in different languages and change in speaking rhythm and tone of voice have been reported. In addition, there was a partial and rarely complete amnesia during attack. Some patients were far beyond their physical strength. In addition, lack of control and harming themselves and others, during attack, have been reported; although, injuries were not serious. Sometimes during attack, The patients express some demands and possessor (Djinn) requests for satisfying these demands. Attacks usually last from 30 minutes to two hours (3). \r\n\r\nIt seems that traumatic and abuse experiences have an essential role in initiation and maintenance of dissociative disorders (7, 8). Results from Bakhshani et al. (3) study showed that 43% of patients experienced their first attack after a traumatic accident (5). After civil war of Mozambique, based on results of a study reported by Igreja et al. (9) on 941 subjects (255 males and 686 females), trauma and civil war resulted damages, which explain high prevalence of this disorder.\r\n\r\nCastillo (10), believes that biological and psychoanalytic perspectives are not capable of explaining spirit possession. Etiologically, he suggested that spirit possession, similar to multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a spontaneous trance reaction to severe and negative events in environment (particularly child abuse). On other hand, Naring and Nijenhuis observed a significant correlation between traumatic events and possession experiences (11). In addition, Naring and Nijenhuis (11) considered dissociative identity disorder to be a consequence of childhood abuse or other traumatic events, thus support post-trauma model. In this regard, a study by Pasquini et al. (12), showed a relationship between traumatic experience in childhood and development of dissociative disorders. Kaplan et al. (13) found that those with higher score in dissociative experience scale had been more sexually abused during their childhood. They have been reported to commit further suicide and aggressive behaviors (13).\r\n\r\nIn general, it can be concluded that traumatic experiences, specifically childhood maltreatment and abuse, are related to possession and dissociative experiences. Therefore, in future studies, it is required to investigate type of cultural beliefs abuse and other environmental factors with onset of clinical signs of Djinatti, and then develop and practice preventive and therapeutic approaches, based on findings.",

      "abstract": "The repertoire of behavioral symptoms depends on the degree of severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to cognitive symptoms such as memory loss and language impairment, patients with AD often develop behavioral symptoms. While cognitive symptoms are required for the diagnosis of AD and are relentlessly progressive, behavioral symptoms are not inevitable, usually fluctuate in severity, and may be intermittent or transient. Before initiating treatment, the physician must determine whether physical illness, medications, or environmental or interpersonal factors are contributing to the behavioral symptoms. Elderly patients are more sensitive than younger adults to medication effects and side effects. The combination of aging and AD produces marked deficits of brain neurotransmitter systems, particularly acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Delusions and hallucinations occur most often in patients with AD who have mild to moderately severe dementia. Anxiety is relatively uncommon in patients with AD. Several classes of medications may be used, most of which can produce tolerance with long-term use.",

It can be differentiated from other disorders causing daytime drowsiness by its clinical symptoms and by sleep laboratory studies. The disorder usually begins in adolescence and remains present throughout life. Genetic susceptibility to narcolepsy is closely associated with specific HLAs that indicate the existence of a gene in the region of the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6 that increases susceptibility to narcolepsy. Neurochemical studies of human and canine narcolepsy have demonstrated disturbed monoaminergic and cholinergic function that may account for impaired regulation of rapid eye movement sleep, but the link between these abnormalities and the genetic factors is still unknown. Treatment of sleepiness with stimulants and cataplexy with tricyclic antidepressants leads to substantial improvement but does not fully resolve symptoms in most patients.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders refer to a spectrum of conditions that interfere with regular sleep patterns. One of the most frequently reported clinical issues is sleep disturbance. Physiological, neurological, social, and mental well-being can be critically affected by insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Overall, health and quality of life can be impacted by sleep disorders. Mental health and sleep share a significant relationship. It has long been acknowledged that individuals with mental health disorders frequently experience sleep issues. The predominant theory has been that sleep issues are basically signs of the psychiatric disorders that they are interrelated with. The fact that sleep issues are defining characteristics of a number of psychiatric disorders and are included in the diagnostic criteria for these conditions supports this aspect. However, sleep and mental health problems are associated further in diverse ways. Emerging research evidence suggests that the relationship between mental health problems and sleep disorders is complex and includes bi-directional causation, in contrast to the long-held view of this relationship that considered sleep issues as symptoms of psychiatric disorders. An increased prevalence of mental/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among certain others, is reported among patients with insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and narcolepsy, suggesting sleep disorders as a risk factor for mental health disorders. Although much has been established about the relationship between impaired mental health and sleep, further research is required to elaborately comprehend this relationship. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the relationship between sleep disorders and mental health.",

Amnesias are common following a traumatic brain injury. Paramnesias are false or distorted recall – seen in acute confusional states or in dementia. Hallucinations are perceptual experiences without an external sensory stimulus – in other words, people see objects that are not there, hear voices, or believe there is a smell. Breakdown in speech production occurs in many dementias, such as motor neurone disease with dementia. Many find the classification of speech disorders difficult. Language competency depends on a discrete set of abilities: sensory decoding of the spoken message, appreciation of meaning, the capacity for repetition, and production of correctly articulated and correct speech.",

However, most individuals with transient insomnia do not develop chronic insomnia. The current study investigated the differential contributing factors for these two conditions to further the understanding of this phenomenon. Method Chronic insomnia patients and normal sleepers with high and low vulnerability to transient insomnia completed measures of pre‐sleep arousal, dysfunctional sleep beliefs, and sleep‐related safety behaviors. Results Both cognitive and somatic pre‐sleep arousals were identified as significant predictors for transient insomnia. Dysfunctional beliefs regarding worry about insomnia and cognitive arousal were predictors for chronic insomnia. Sleep‐related safety behavior, although correlated with insomnia severity, was not a significant predictor for both conditions. Conclusions Dysfunctional beliefs associated with worry and losing control over sleep are the most critical factors in differentiating chronic insomnia from transient insomnia. These factors should be addressed to help prevent individuals with high sleep vulnerability from developing chronic sleep disturbance.",

Nevertheless, after comprehensive evaluations, the conclusive diagnosis was confirmed as ataxic sensory neuropathy with Sjögren's syndrome.

      "title": "Cognition in Restless Legs Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Cognition is the mental abilities related to knowledge which includes attention, memory, language, judgment, and decision making. Cognitive function can be affected by several factors including attention, emotion, and sleep. In restless legs syndrome (RLS), cognitive dysfunction may ensue due to sleep disturbance, emotional disorders, and attention deficit which are common in RLS. However, it remains unclear whether cognitive performance is decreased in patients with RLS. To date, there are ten published articles which studied cognition in RLS. Five studies reported cognitive dysfunction of RLS, particularly decreased performance in the attention, frontal executive function, and mental flexibility function. Three reported no significant differences in cognitive performance between RLS patients and control subjects. Two studies reported even better performance in patients with RLS compared with control subjects. Dopamine agonist may improve cognitive performance in RLS. However, it remains unclear whether this is direct effect on RLS symptoms or indirect effect including improved sleep duration, daytime sleepiness and depression, or both. Event-related potential studies demonstrated reduced P300 amplitude either oddball task or Sternberg working memory task. Larger sample and studies using functional neuroimaging study are needed to confirm whether cognition is impaired or not in RLS.

Ich patologia wiąże się z utratą komórek nerwowych, zaś istota procesu chorobowego wiedzie do wystąpienia wielu objawów uszkodzeń neurologicznych, związanych z funkcją motoryczną (np. ataksja) oraz z pamięcią (demencja). Proces wiodący do pojawienia się objawów choroby neurodegeneracyjnej rozpoczyna się znacznie wcześniej, zanim się one pojawią. Przebiega często przez wiele lat i bywa bezobjawowy. Pierwsze symptomy pojawiają się gdy znacząca liczba neuronów ulegnie uszkodzeniu, bądź uszkodzenie dotyczy określonej części ośrodkowego układu nerwowego. Jedną z chorób neurodegradacyjnych jest choroba Alzheimera . Dotyczy głównie osób po 65. roku życia i dotyka 5-7% populacji. Czas jej trwania wynosi ok. 8-14 lat. Specyfiką choroby jest stopniowe i nieodwracalne zaburzenie homeostazy organizmu, zaburzenia procesów poznawczych i postępujący zanik pamięci, który prowadzi do zaburzeń orientacji wzrokowo-przestrzennej. Pojawiająca się apraksja skutkuje niemożnością posługiwania się przyborami codziennego użytku. W późnej fazie otępienie jest bardzo nasilone zaś pamięć często ograniczona jedynie do faktów autobiograficznych. Zaburzenia mowy są na tyle zaawansowane, że chory może wypowiadać pojedyncze słowa. Występują również zaburzenia emocjonalne, przejawiające się apatią lub agresywnością. Zaburzenia obejmują również problemy z przeżuwaniem, przełykaniem i kontrolą zwieraczy. Występowanie choroby w strukturze rodziny wywołuje liczne zmiany oraz wyrzeczenia ze strony jej członków.",

      "abstract": "Lewy body disease (LBD) is a progressive neurological disorder with parkinsonism, having many Lewy bodies (LBs) and degenerative changes. LBD is classified into the three types according to the distribution of LBs: \"brain-stem type\", \"transitional type\" and \"diffuse type\". The brain-stem type is identical to classical Parkinson's disease (PD). The diffuse type is nominated as \"diffuse Lewy body disease\" (DLBD). DLBD is a neuropathological entity, characterized by abundant LBs not only in the basal ganglia and brain-stem but in the cerebral cortex, combined with senile changes. Juvenile onset DLBD is called \"pure form\" of DLBD because of no or few senile changes. The LBs are present in the amygdala, nucleus basalis of Meynert, hypothalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, nucleus paranigralis, locus caeruleus, dorsal vagal nucleus and reticular nuclei. The cerebral LBs are numerous in the parahippocampal gyrus, cingular gyrus, and insular, frontal and temporal cortices. The LBs show immunoreactivity to ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-immunoreactive neurites in the CA2-3 region appear to be specific for DLBD. The clinical features of DLBD in the senium are progressive dementia, psychotic state, parkinsonism and autonomic signs. In general, progressive dementia is an initial symptom, followed by parkinsonism in the later stage. Some show progressive autonomic failure. A few present respiratory failure or vocal cord palsy resulting in sudden death in DLBD. DLBD is characterized neurochemically by severe affection of multiple neurotransmitters networks. In DLBD an impairment of the innominato-cortical cholinergic and mesocortical dopaminergic system, differentiating from Alzheimer's disease and PD, may play an important role in developing disease process.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Lennox–Gastaut (L‐G) syndrome is an intractable generalized epilepsy of childhood onset, associated with spike waves at a slow rate and paroxysmal fast activity. These epileptiform discharge patterns are thought to reflect excessive neocortical excitability and arise from neuronal and synaptic features peculiar to the immature central nervous system. The epileptic processes associated with L‐G syndrome may lead to enduring patterns of abnormal activity and connectivity. These abnormal patterns compete with normal developmental mechanisms and may result in subsequent impairment and/or regression of cognition. Recurring or prolonged seizures themselves may also damage the brain. We hypothesize that the presence of slow spike waves diverts the brain from normal developmental processes toward seizure‐preventing mechanisms. Adding to this burden, antiepileptic medications, sleep disruption, and social isolation all retard cognitive development and the learning process at a crucial time of brain maturation.

However, little is known about the factors that are associated with these cognitive biases. Recently, researchers have begun to consider whether neurocognitive deficits, common in schizophrenia, may be risk factors for the development of cognitive biases. In the present study, we assessed neurocognition (verbal learning, delayed verbal recall memory, and verbal recognition memory) and cognitive biases (knowledge corruption and impaired cognitive insight) in 72 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. As hypothesized, poorer delayed verbal recall memory was associated with increased knowledge corruption. Contrary to expectations, verbal learning and verbal memory were not associated with cognitive insight. These findings suggest that an inadequate recall memory system may put patients with schizophrenia at greater risk for cognitive distortions.",

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors are considered to be manifestations of the same nosologic continuum. It has been proposed that a sudden arousal from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is the cause of these disorders. Benign forms of NREM arousal parasomnias occur frequently in childhood and attenuate in teen years; however, they can persist into or begin in adulthood. The available literature documents high levels of psychopathology in adult patients. Sleepwalking and night terrors are most likely to manifest during the first episode of slow wave sleep, but may also appear any time during NREM sleep. The hypersynchronous delta activity, previously considered to be a hallmark of somnambulism, has proven to be unspecific. Post-arousal EEG activity reveals altered consciousness during sleepwalking and sleep terror episodes. Pathophysiology of NREM arousal parasomnias consists of predisposing factors, which may be a genetically determined tendency for deep sleep, facilitating factors which deepen sleep and increase slow wave sleep, and triggering factors which increase sleep fragmentation, such as stress, environmental or endogenous stimuli, and stimulants. Recently published data on low delta power in the first sleep cycle and slow decline of delta power in successive sleep cycles suggest a chronic inability to sustain slow wave sleep.",

      "title": "Relationship between Sleep Quality and Cognitive Function in Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in middle-aged and elderly people. PD is characterized by resting tremor, myotonia, bradykinesia, abnormal posture, and gait. The incident of PD increases with age. In addition to motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms have raised additional concerns in recent years. Cognitive impairment is very common in PD patients. It is estimated that the incidence of PD mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is 20–50%,[1] which is present at the initial visit in some patients and a great number of patients with PD-MCI eventually develop PD with dementia (PDD). PD patients are much more likely to develop dementia than the normal population. It has been found that 2/3 of PD patients suffer from different forms of sleep disorders, which are indicated to be one of the common nonmotor symptoms in PD patients. The symptoms of various sleep disorders in PD patients include night insomnia, increased sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, reduced sleep efficiency, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, thus having a serious impact on the patient's sleep quality and increasing the risk of dementia.[2] Therefore, cognitive dysfunction and sleep disorders are two important nonmotor symptoms of PD, exerting greater impacts on the quality of life (QOL). Here, we evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and cognitive function of PD patients. From May 2016 to May 2017, we enrolled a total of 111 native Chinese patients with primary PD and without audiovisual dysfunction who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, the First Hospital of Hebei Medical University. The diagnosis of PD was based on the criteria of the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank. Moreover, the diagnosis of PDD conformed to the diagnostic criteria of dementia proposed by the Movement Disorder Society Task Force: (1) diagnosis of primary PD, (2) PD-related cognitive decline by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), (3) cognitive impairment that affected the patient's daily life ability, and (4) development of extrapyramidal system of PD before dementia, with regular time interval. Patient information was collected by two trained neurologists, including name, sex, age, duration of illness, and educational level. Of these, duration of disease was calculated from the time the patient initially complained of discomfort. The assessment was performed since medications were initiated. The Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) was used to assess the severity of the disease, and Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) staging was utilized for disease rating. According to the severity, the patients were divided into stage 1.0–5.0, including mild (1.0–2.0), moderate (2.5–3.0), and severe (4.0–5.0). According to complaints of patients and their family concerning declined cognitive function and interference with daily life activities in our study, PD patients were divided into three groups as follows: normal group, MCI group, and dementia group, according to MMSE and MoCA (Beijing version) normal cognitive function. MoCA ≥26 points and denying cognitive decline was categorized as a normal cognitive function, MoCA <26 points and MMSE ≥26 as well as a complaint of decreased cognitive function but denying interference with daily life activities as MCI, and MMSE <26 and complaint of decreased cognitive function and affected daily lives as dementia. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate the quality of sleep in PD patients over the pastmonth. Patients with PSQI score ≥6 points were classified as suffering sleep disorders, and patients with long-term use of sleeping pills were excluded. SPSS version 19.0 software (SPSS, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Student's t-test was used for the comparisons. The significance level was set at a value of P < 0.05. There were a total of 111 (61 males and 50 females) PD patients, with a mean age of 66.5 ± 8.7 years, a mean educational level of 11.2 ± 3.5 years and a mean duration of 6.1 ± 4.1 years. The mean H-Y staging was 2.20 ± 0.80, which was classified as mild-to-moderate PD, including mild in 59 (53.15%) patients, and moderate in 52 (46.85%) patients. Patients with PSQI ≥6 were diagnosed with having sleep disorders. There were 67 (60.36%) patients with cognitive impairment, including 30 (27.03%) with MCI and 37 (33.33%) with dementia. The MMSE score in dementia group was 23.04 ± 1.73, which was categorized as mild dementia. The results of the comparison of sleep quality in PD patients with different cognitive levels showed different sleep quality in mild PD patients with different cognitive levels, with the poorest sleep quality in the dementia group. Pairwise comparison showed that the PSQI score was significantly higher in the dementia group than in the normal group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) [Supplementary Table 1]. Different cognitive levels in moderate PD patients were associated with different sleep quality, with the poorest quality in the dementia group. The pairwise comparison indicated significantly higher PSQI scores in dementia group than in the normal group (P < 0.01) [Supplementary Table 2]. Regarding sleep quality, no significant differences were noted in mild and moderate PD patients (P = 0.935).Supplementary Table 1: Comparison of sleep quality in mild Parkinson's disease patients with different cognitive levelsSupplementary Table 2: Comparison of sleep quality in moderate Parkinson's disease patients with different cognitive levelsWith respect to general information in PD patients with different sleep quality, there was no significant difference between the two PD groups regarding age, educational level, duration of disease, and H-Y staging (P > 0.05). However, UPDRS score was significantly higher in the sleep disturbance group than in the normal group, whereas MoCA score and MMSE score were remarkably lower than those in the normal group (both P < 0.05) [Table 1]. The correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between cognitive level and sleep quality in PD patients after controlling H-Y variables (r = 0.461, P < 0.01).Table 1: Comparison of general information in Parkinson's disease patients with different sleep conditionsPD is a common degenerative disease of CNS in the elderly. In addition to motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms in recent years, such as cognitive decline, sleep disorders, autonomic nerve damage, anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, seriously affect the QOL of patients, thereby raising additional concerns. A considerable number of people experience decreased sleep quality at the onset of early PD or before PD symptoms. Common types of sleep disorders in PD patients include difficulty falling asleep, wakefulness/sleep fragmentation, daytime lethargy, sleep-deprivation, REM sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep episodes. In addition, altered sleep parameters have been observed, including sleep structure. Those are confronted with unapparent difficulties of falling asleep, difficulties of maintaining sleep and disordered sleep structure, higher incidence of asymptomatic periodic limb movements, and REM sleep behavior disorder, adversely impacting patients' QOL. There are studies suggesting that RBD is a risk factor for cognitive impairment in PD patients.[3] As we reported, mean H-Y staging of all 111 patients was 2.20 ± 0.80, showing a mild-to-moderate PD. PQSI scale was used to assess the quality of sleep in 111 PD patients enrolled, indicating the prevalence of 54.95% in sleep disorders. PD sleep disorders have been reported to be associated with aging, the severity of illness, depression, and dopaminergic dose. There is no consensus on the prevalence of sleep disorders in PD patients based on various studies, which is, however, generally higher than our results. Several studies have shown that PD patients suffer abnormal sleep at an early stage, which is likely to worsen as the disease progresses. Even at early stage, PD patients have a significantly decreased health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) compared with their peers, and that PD impacts HR-QOL in various manners. PD at an early stage has a limited effect on HR-QOL due to relatively mild motor symptoms. Thus, the priority should be given to nonmotor symptoms. The authors of the study recognize depression, fatigue, and sleep disorders as the leading cause of the decline in HR-QOL in early PD patients.[4] The current findings reveal that a higher rate (54.95%) of sleep disorders is noted in mild-to-moderate PD patients, and sleep disorders negatively impact cognitive function in PD patients, thereby leading to further decline of HR-QOL. Sleep disorders and cognitive disorders, as the two major nonmotor symptoms of PD, interact with each other. Sleep disorders can be seen as a concomitant symptom of cognitive impairment and can lead to involvement of the brainstem nerve nucleus, thus impairing cognitive function. The current results showed that sleep disorders in PD patients were associated with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and a marked decline in cognitive function. Consistent with the above findings, PD patients with dementia had poorer sleep quality than those with normal cognitive function, suggesting an interaction between sleep quality and cognitive function. Based on studies in the Western countries,[5] α-synuclein, Aβ protein, and tau protein have been found in multiple brain functional areas of PD patients with sleep disorders. Currently, Aβ protein and tau protein are recognized to be associated with pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease.[6] In addition, α-synuclein abnormally aggregates to form Lewy bodies, which are characteristic pathological changes of Lewy body dementia, suggesting a common pathological basis of sleep disorders and cognitive decline. This study has several limitations. First, patients enrolled had mild-to-moderate PD and MCI. Second, there was a small sample size. Third, the effect of medications patients took on sleep is not taken into account. Last, the types of sleep disorders patients suffered were not specified. Patients with severe PD should be included, and larger sample size is needed. In addition, research methods need to be improved to obtain more detailed and accurate data. Conclusively, our findings suggest that sleep disorder in PD patients can be considered as a concomitant symptom of cognitive decline, and further aggravate cognitive impairment, indicating a potential interaction. Although the underlying pathophysiological processes remain incompletely understood, the association between sleep disorders and cognitive function in PD patients may suggest a decrease in dopamine levels in the limbic system.

      "abstract": "El proposito de esta revision es realizar una actualizacion acerca de los trastornos cognoscitivos mas frecuentes en los pacientes epilepticos. Aunque muchos epilepticos mantienen sus capacidades intelectuales y llevan un estilo de vida normal, otros pacientes no son tan afortunados y sufren un impacto directo sobre las funciones cognoscitivas y/o la conducta. La detencion o regresion en el desarrollo, dificultades en el aprendizaje o una marcada fluctuacion en las habilidades cognoscitivas pueden ser los sintomas de presentacion. La disfuncion neuropsicologica en ninos con epilepsia tiene diversas causas interrelacionadas, incluyendo factores organicos, factores relacionados con la enfermedad (etiologia de la epilepsia, edad de inicio, frecuencia y tipo de las crisis, duracion de la enfermedad, las descargas subclinicas epileptiformes) y con el tratamiento. Las funciones cognoscitivas mas afectadas por la epilepsia son: memoria, atencion, funciones ejecutivas y lenguaje. Palabras Clave: epilepsia, disfuncion cognitiva, trastorno cognitivo transitorio, electroencefalograma.",

      "abstract": "Sleep problems, particularly sleep deprivation and fragmentations, are common hazards in modern lifestyles and maybe an unavoidable occupational drawback. Different metabolic or hereditary causes may induce sleep problems. Cognitive functions and the closely related metacognition, which depends significantly on decision making, are essential for learning and problem-solving. When impaired for any reason, the quality of life deteriorates, and the person may become dependent on others in severe cases of dysfunction. Sleep and cognition/metacognition are related, and an insult to one function may lead to the other domain's collapse. The present review highlights the significant causes and conditions of sleep problems, cognitive and metacognitive dysfunctions, the possible mechanisms, interactions, and the potential tools or agents that may improve them.",

A normal examination with discordant findings; abnormal examination findings which rule out malingering or suggest a co-occurring condition; functional neurologic findings on examination, for instance, slowness, stop medicine sign or slowness in the mental status examination and objective findings and presence of objective findings which can and cannot be malingered. The patient would acknowledge they can hear the noise. Then the patient is either blindfolded or asked to close his or her eyes while repeating the examination. When the tuning fork is placed on the vertex of the head the patient has the ability to hear the noise in the good ear, which causes lateralization. Historically, the motor examination has been the most studied out of all the neurological examinations for signs of feigning or malingering.",

      "title": "Multiple sclerosis and its psychiatric symptomatology",
      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease with motor, cognitive, and other neuropsychiatric manifestations. Cognitive symptoms include impairments in attention, information processing efficiency and speed, executive functions, and long-term memory. These cognitive impairments are independent of the disease’s duration and are minimally associated with neurological manifestations. Most MS patients require psychiatric treatment, usually for cognitive or affective disorders. Therapeutic management includes treatment of acute exacerbations, symptomatic treatment, and disease-modifying treatments/biological therapies. This case presentation aims to emphasize the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists when addressing the psychiatric manifestations of MS. Our patient is a 52-year-old man who presented to our clinic with suicidal ideation, a plan and method, depressive mood, multiple delusions, affective inversion towards family members, severe anxiety, and irritability, symptoms that led to significantly diminished functionality. He also presented with neurological symptoms and severe damage to the motor area. MS is a chronic, progressive disease with well-known neurological symptoms. However, the psychiatric manifestations are often overlooked. MS is thought to be an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks the myelin sheath that protects nerve fibers, resulting in inflammation and damage, which eventually leads to a loss of function. The psychiatric manifestations of MS can be just as debilitating as the physical symptoms and can significantly reduce quality of life. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach between specialists in psychiatry and neurology is often necessary to provide the most appropriate medical care for patients.",

      "abstract": "Congenital abnormalities of the optic disc are not so rare. The etiology for the most of them is unknown. Visual acuity of affected eye may be minimally or severely affected, depending on the extent of lesion. All of these conditions can be unilateral or bilateral. Children who have unilateral optic disc abnormalities generally present during the preschool years with sensory esotropia. Visual acuity may be unaffected like in optic disc pit, optic disc drusen, fibre medullares, ect. However, during the evolution they may cause a decrease in visual acuity like serous retinal detachment in optic disc pit, atrophy or subretinal neovascularisation in optic disc drusen. Some of them like fibre medullares needs only a good diagnose and they do not have any evolution. Fluorescein angiography and ultrasonography may be crucial diagnostic procedures to discover some of them, like optic disc drusen. Optic disc abnormalities may be associated with other congenital disorders of the eye and often central nervous system malformations. Secondary they may be associated retinal detachment, retinochisis, macular edema, choroid neovascularisation and lipid exudation. Some of these conditions may be found on routine ophthalmologic exam such as optic disc drusen and fibre medullares and often are diagnostically problem. The aim of our study was to present some of our cases with different optic disc abnormalities such as fibre medullares, optic disc coloboma, hypoplasio disc, optic disc drusen and optic disc pit.",

      "title": "The impact of stress on sleep: Pathogenic sleep reactivity as a vulnerability to insomnia and circadian disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep reactivity is the trait-like degree to which stress exposure disrupts sleep, resulting in difficulty falling and staying asleep. Individuals with highly reactive sleep systems experience drastic deterioration of sleep when stressed, whereas those with low sleep reactivity proceed largely unperturbed during stress. Research shows that genetics, familial history of insomnia, female gender and environmental stress influence how the sleep system responds to stress. Further work has identified neurobiological underpinnings for sleep reactivity involving disrupted cortical networks and dysregulation in the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Sleep reactivity is most pathologically and clinically pertinent when in excess, such that high sleep reactivity predicts risk for future insomnia disorder, with early evidence suggesting high sleep reactivity corresponds to severe insomnia phenotypes (sleep onset insomnia and short sleep insomnia). High sleep reactivity is also linked to risk of shift-work disorder, depression and anxiety. Importantly, stress-related worry and rumination may exploit sensitive sleep systems, thereby augmenting the pathogenicity of sleep reactivity. With the development of cost-effective assessment of sleep reactivity, we can now identify individuals at risk of future insomnia, shift-work disorder and mental illness, thus identifying a target population for preventive intervention. Given that insomniacs with high sleep reactivity tend to present with severe insomnia phenotypes, patient sleep reactivity may inform triaging to different levels of treatment. Future research on sleep reactivity is needed to clarify its neurobiology, characterize its long-term prospective associations with insomnia and shift-work disorder phenotypes, and establish its prognostic value for mental illness and other non-sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies: recognition and approaches to care",
      "abstract": "Abstract The term “developmental and epileptic encephalopathy” (DEE) refers to when cognitive functions are influenced by both seizure and interictal epileptiform activity and the neurobiological process behind the epilepsy. Many DEEs are related to gene variants and the onset is typically during early childhood. In this setting, neurocognition, whilst not improved by seizure control, may benefit from some precision therapies. In patients with non‐progressive diseases with cognitive impairment and co‐existing epilepsy, in whom the epileptiform activity does not affect or has minimal effect on function, the term “developmental encephalopathy” (DE) can be used. In contrast, for those patients with direct impact on cognition due to epileptic or epileptiform activity, the term “epileptic encephalopathy” (EE) is preferred, as most can revert to their normal or near normal baseline cognitive state with appropriate intervention. These children need aggressive treatment. Clinicians must tailor care towards individual needs and realistic expectations for each affected person; those with DE are unlikely to gain from aggressive antiseizure medication whilst those with EE will gain. Patients with DEE might benefit from a precision medicine approach in order to reduce the overall burden of epilepsy.",

Case summary: History-taking, ophthalmologic examination, neurologic examination, cerebrospinal fluid examination including 14-3-3 protein analysis, and brain MRI were performed in a 48-year-old man with progressive visual loss and a visual field defect. These symptoms were accompanied by visual illusion and macropsia. Neurologic examination revealed relatively rapidly progressing cognitive impairment, ataxia, aphasia, and myoclonus. The 14-3-3 protein was detectable in otherwise normal CSF samples. The diffusion weighted brain MRI showed increased signal intensity in both occipital lobes, the basal ganglia, the temporal and frontal lobes. He was clinically diagnosed as having a Heidenhain variant of sporadic CJD. Conclusions: In a patient with a rapidly progressive visual loss, visual field defects, visual illusion, and neurologic abnormalities including progressive dementia, ataxia, aphasia, and myoclonus, the Heidenhain variant of CJD should be considered. Because prions, a cause of CJD, exhibit unusual resistance to conventional chemical and physical decontamination methods, it is necessary to have an appropriate management scheme to prevent the spread of infection.",

Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment.

      "abstract": "Introduction Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease affecting primarily the central nervous system, characterized by focal lesions of white-matter demyelination. It can present with a variety of neurological symptoms, including monocular vision loss, sensory loss, paresthesias, limb weakness, ataxia and bladder dysfunction, and has a typically chronic and progressive course. Neuropsychiatric manifestations including depressive or manic symptoms, anxiety disorders and psychosis, are also frequently observed, and are of particular importance to mental health practitioners. Objectives To describe a case of a 45-year-old female patient with a history of suspected MS presenting with manic symptoms, and to discuss the possible neuropsychiatric manifestations of Multiple Sclerosis. Methods Clinical case report and literature review. Results A 45-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department presenting with severe acute agitation, irritable mood, rapid speech and persecutory delusions. She had no prior history of neuropsychiatric symptoms, but her medical history was notable for a suspected diagnosis of MS, having suffered an episode of optic neuritis 16 years before the present episode. Magnetic Ressonance Imaging performed 3 months before emergency admission documented non-specific white-matter lesions presenting as hyper-intense in long TR sequences, as well as a cervical lesion of atypical characteristics, representing possible spondylotic myelopathy or demyelination. A head CT performed at emergency admission did not reveal relevant acute findings. The patient was hospitalized and initiated risperidone and valproic acid therapy. She responded favorably to medication, with progressive stabilization of mood and remission of delusional ideas over three weeks. Conclusions Neuropsychiatric symptoms are a common and concerning manifestation of Multiple Sclerosis. The present case illustrates that clinicians should be on alert for signs of mood and psychotic symptoms in patients with suspected or confirmed MS, as these can manifest at any point during the disease course.

      "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in most neurological disorders and can have a major impact on the patient’s disability and quality of life. However, mostly due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and the complexity of the underlying comorbidities, depression can be difficult to diagnose, resulting in limited recognition and in undertreatment. The early detection and treatment of depression simultaneously with the neurological disorder is key to avoiding deterioration and further disability. Although the neurologist should be able to identify and treat depression initially, a neuropsychiatry team should be available for severe cases and those who are unresponsive to treatment. Neurologists should be also aware that in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, different depression symptoms could develop at different stages of the disease. The treatment options for depression in neurological diseases include drugs, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and somatic interventions, among others, but often, the evidence-based efficacy is limited and the results are highly variable. Here, we review recent research on the diagnosis and treatment of depression in the context of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and strokes, with the aim of identifying common approaches and solutions for its initial management by the neurologist.",

Ocular impairments can affect various aspects of vision and eye movement. Thus, patients can show dry eyes, blepharospasm, reduced blink rate, saccadic eye movement abnormalities, smooth pursuit deficits, and impaired voluntary and reflexive eye movements. Furthermore, visuoperceptive impairments affect the ability to perceive and recognize visual stimuli accurately, including impaired contrast sensitivity and reduced visual acuity, color discrimination, and object recognition. Visuospatial impairments are also remarkable, including difficulties perceiving and interpreting spatial relationships between objects and difficulties judging distances or navigating through the environment. Moreover, PD patients can present visuospatial attention problems, with difficulties attending to visual stimuli in a spatially organized manner. Moreover, PD patients also show perceptual disturbances affecting their ability to interpret and determine meaning from visual stimuli. And, for instance, visual hallucinations are common in PD patients. Nevertheless, the neurobiological bases of visual-related disorders in PD are complex and not fully understood. This review intends to provide a comprehensive description of visual disturbances in PD, from sensory to perceptual alterations, addressing their neuroanatomical, functional, and neurochemical correlates. Structural changes, particularly in posterior cortical regions, are described, as well as functional alterations, both in cortical and subcortical regions, which are shown in relation to specific neuropsychological results. Similarly, although the involvement of different neurotransmitter systems is controversial, data about neurochemical alterations related to visual impairments are presented, especially dopaminergic, cholinergic, and serotoninergic systems.",

If neurons die, become dysfunctional, or are disconnected following a challenge, functionality of the affected neural circuit is compromised. Depending on the magnitude and localization, this may have relatively mild consequences (such as a learning deficit) or major consequences (such as developmental delay, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or death). We are interested in selective or regional neuron death because they can help to explain the neurologic dysfunction experienced by an individual or give insight into the pathologic process that preceded death.",

      "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), a condition of dream enactment, often predates Parkinson's disease (PD) and is the result of early neurodegenerative processes in the brainstem. Normally, REM sleep is characterized by vivid mentation combined with skeletal muscle paralysis. This REM atonia is diminished or absent in RBD, which enables patients to act out their dreams with violent, injurious nocturnal behaviors. Consistent with an impending neurodegenerative disorder, patients with RBD demonstrate subtle motor, autonomic, and cognitive changes frequently seen in synucleinopathies. These disorders include PD as well as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In PD, RBD is linked with the akinetic–rigid predominant subtype, gait freezing, and predicts aggressive cognitive impairment. Clinical management is focused upon decreasing the potential for sleep-related injuries (SRIs), treating comorbid sleep disorders, and eliminating exacerbating agents. High-dose melatonin, low-dose clonazepam, and combined melatonin–clonazepam appear to be effective therapies.",

      "title": "Autonomic Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) results not only in motor and sensory deficits but also in autonomic dysfunctions. The disruption of connections between higher brain centers and the spinal cord, or the impaired autonomic nervous system itself, manifests a broad range of autonomic abnormalities. This includes compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, thermoregulatory, and sexual activities. These disabilities evoke potentially life‐threatening symptoms that severely interfere with the daily living of those with SCI. In particular, high thoracic or cervical SCI often causes disordered hemodynamics due to deregulated sympathetic outflow. Episodic hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia develops as a result of massive sympathetic discharge often triggered by unpleasant visceral or sensory stimuli below the injury level. In the pelvic floor, bladder and urethral dysfunctions are classified according to upper motor neuron versus lower motor neuron injuries; this is dependent on the level of lesion. Most impairments of the lower urinary tract manifest in two interrelated complications: bladder storage and emptying. Inadequate or excessive detrusor and sphincter functions as well as detrusor‐sphincter dyssynergia are examples of micturition abnormalities stemming from SCI. Gastrointestinal motility disorders in spinal cord injured‐individuals are comprised of gastric dilation, delayed gastric emptying, and diminished propulsive transit along the entire gastrointestinal tract. As a critical consequence of SCI, neurogenic bowel dysfunction exhibits constipation and/or incontinence. Thus, it is essential to recognize neural mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying various complications of autonomic dysfunctions after SCI. This overview provides both vital information for better understanding these disorders and guides to pursue novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate secondary complications. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

      "title": "Eye movement disorders and neurological symptoms in late‐onset inborn errors of metabolism",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Inborn errors of metabolism in adults are still largely unexplored. Despite the fact that adult‐onset phenotypes have been known for many years, little attention is given to these disorders in neurological practice. The adult‐onset presentation differs from childhood‐onset phenotypes, often leading to considerable diagnostic delay. The identification of these patients at the earliest stage of disease is important, given that early treatment may prevent or lessen further brain damage. Neurological and psychiatric symptoms occur more frequently in adult forms. Abnormalities of eye movements are also common and can be the presenting sign. Eye movement disorders can be classified as central or peripheral. Central forms are frequently observed in lysosomal storage disorders, whereas peripheral forms are a key feature of mitochondrial disease. Furthermore, oculogyric crisis is an important feature in disorders affecting dopamine syntheses or transport. Ocular motor disorders are often not reported by the patient, and abnormalities can be easily overlooked in a general examination. In adults with unexplained psychiatric and neurological symptoms, a special focus on examination of eye movements can serve as a relatively simple clinical tool to detect a metabolic disorder. Eye movements can be easily quantified and analyzed with video‐oculography, making them a valuable biomarker for following the natural course of disease or the response to therapies. Here, we review, for the first time, eye movement disorders that can occur in inborn errors of metabolism, with a focus on late‐onset forms. We provide a step‐by‐step overview that will help clinicians to examine and interpret eye movement disorders. © 2018 The Authors.

      "abstract": "A number of mental disorders comprise aberrant perceptions that are often described as possessing a perceptual quality approaching real-life sensory experience, while at the same time lacking a sensory correlate in the real world. Healthy individuals can also have perceptual experience without an external correlate when they engage in mental imagery. Aberrant perceptions differ from mental imagery in their lack of voluntary control and the sense of reality. Early theories suggested that increased imagery vividness could lead to aberrant perceptions in a number of clinical disorders. However, cognitive and neuroimaging studies do not endorse this view, and instead suggest that mental imagery comprises a functional architecture that is at least partly shared with memory and perception. Miscommunication or disconnection between brain areas or functional modules within this architecture may give rise to aberrant perceptions and their sense of reality. We describe the evidence for this view in relation to psychotic hallucinations in schizophrenia, hallucinations in neurodegenerative disorders and flashbacks of traumatic events in post-traumatic stress disorder. We suggest that an impaired neural architecture of imagery, rather than merely increased intensity or vividness of imagery, underlies aberrant perceptions. This view fits with neurobiological models of mental disorders that suggest that psychopathological symptoms arise from disrupted communication between brain areas.",

The alteration of consciousness during epileptic seizures is discussed with respect to these findings: Alterations of consciousness during epileptic seizures may be produced by subcortical, i.e., reticular formation, and/or cortical dysfunction followed by excessive, hypersynchronous neuronal discharges. An impairment of consciousness during absence seizures may be due mainly to cortical dysfunction; during complex partial seizures (CPS), it may be due to dysfunctional subcortical neuronal structures. The mechanisms underlying an alteration of consciousness are defined as causing “irritative” functional disturbances and/or as having “inhibitory” effects on consciousness‐related structures.",

Sleep issues may affect children differently than adults, and distinct treatment approaches are often used in children.Sodium oxybate was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2018 for an expanded indication of treatment of sleepiness or cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy type 1 or narcolepsy type 2 aged 7 years or older, with side effect and safety profiles similar to those seen in adults. Restless sleep disorder is a recently proposed entity in which restless sleep, daytime sleepiness, and often iron deficiency are observed, but children do not meet the criteria for restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movement disorder.Children's sleep is discussed in this article, including normal sleep patterns and effects of insufficient sleep. Sleep disorders of childhood are reviewed, including insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, parasomnias, narcolepsy, and Kleine-Levin syndrome. Children with neurologic issues or neurodevelopmental disorders frequently have sleep disorders arising from an interaction of heterogeneous factors. Further attention to sleep may often be warranted through a polysomnogram or referral to a pediatric sleep specialist. Sleep disorders may cause indelible effects on children's cognitive functioning, general health, and well-being, and awareness of sleep disorders is imperative for neurologists who treat children.",

      "title": "Early Diagnosis of Visual Defects",
      "abstract": "Usually the defect will occur gradually affecting either the visual acuity of one eye only, or the visual field of one or both eyes. In the very young, the defect which goes unnoticed until school age and the consequent school medical examination is unilateral suppression amblyopia induced by strabismus or anisometropia. There is a very much better response to treatment if the problem can be detected at about age three when it is possible to assess a child's visual acuity with accuracy. Further there now exist appropriate diagnostic techniques such as the simple 'cover test' which can be efficiently administered by an orthoptic technician to children of this age. In the elderly, the more important causes of defective vision include vascular disorders, cataract, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and chronic glaucoma. However, only the last two offer scope for early detection and treatment. The detection of diabetic retinopathy depends in turn on the early detection of diabetes. Chronic glaucoma is an important cause of blindness and signs of the disease may be present for a long while before the patient is conscious of any abnormal symptoms and it is therefore a suitable problem for early detection. Treatment is based entirely on the reduction of intra-ocular pressure. Detection of the disease is frequently by measurement of this pressure by tonometry, but this presents problems in that it is not possible to indicate an upper limit for normal pressure. It also gives a positive finding in many who have normal visual fields and who are unlikely to have future loss of vision. It would be unreasonable to treat these patients in the hope that they might benefit, especially as the treatment has undesirable side effects and interferes with the subjects' enjoyment of life. There is a clear need therefore, for the development of tests which can be used on those with pressures above a certain level and which will predict more accurately the probability of future loss of vision. Meantime, other methods of early diagnosis, all of which are cheaper than tonometry, include determination of the visual fields, observing the retina by ophthalmoscopy and selection by family history. The first method detects those who already have a significant loss of function and is thus concerned with established disease rather than the true pre-symptomatic stage. Ophthalmoscopy is practised by every optician in the course of a routine eye test, but the number of false positives is high until a latest age in the disease. There is a high prevalence of abnormality amongst relatives of known sufferers, so this does provide a method of initial selection to be followed by a more thorough examination. It is recommended that this last method be implemented under the direction of the General Practitioner.",

It is a complex age-related epilepsy syndrome with multiple possible etiologies such as hypoxic ischemic injuries, genetic syndromes, cerebral cortical malformations, and tumors. The etiology may remain elusive in approximately 25% of the cases.1 Similar to many other childhood epilepsy syndromes, the age at onset can be variable but can be delayed into adulthood. LGS is characterized by multiple seizure types, abnormal EEG characteristics, and cognitive decline. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus, previous diagnosis of West syndrome, earlier age at onset, and a symptomatic etiology are the known independent risk factors for progressive neuropsychological decline. Multiple seizures types, such as tonic-atonic drop attacks, tonic seizures, focal impaired awareness seizures, atypical absences, myoclonic seizures, focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, or generalized seizures, can be encountered. Diffuse generalized slowing, generalized paroxysmal fast activity of 10–20 Hz mainly during non-REM sleep, and slow spike and slow wave (<2.5 Hz) are some of the electroencephalographic hallmarks of this syndrome. Both pediatric and adult epileptologists are well familiar with the diagnostic challenges and delays and medical intractability of LGS. Brain MRI can help clinicians to exclude focal or diffuse structural abnormalities. Genetic/chromosomal DNA microarrays are other diagnostic tools because the disease lacks any biomarkers. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have found lamotrigine, valproic acid, topiramate, felbamate, clobazam,2 rufinamide,3 and cannabidiol4 to be effective. Other treatment options include ketogenic diet, vagal nerve stimulation, corpus callosotomy, anterior thalamic stimulation, or even resection of focal lesions.5",

      "abstract": "Synopsis The CNS maintains a fundamental distinction between actions elicited by external stimuli and actions elicited by internal goals (acts of will). As a result the intact organism can monitor centrally three aspects of its own actions: (1) the action appropriate to current external stimulation (stimulus intention or meaning); (2) the action appropriate to current goals (willed intention); and (3) the action which was actually selected (corollary discharge). In Type I (acute) schizophrenic patients, intentions of will lead to actions, but these willed intentions are not monitored correctly. This apparent discrepancy between will and action gives rise to experiential (1st rank) positive symptoms (e.g. delusions of control and passivity). In Type II (chronic) patients, intentions of will are no longer properly formed and so actions are rarely elicited via this route. This gives rise to behavioural negative signs (e.g. poverty of speech). The behaviour of Type II schizophrenics has surface similarities to that shown by patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with frontal lobe lesions in that all three types of patient show a relative deficit of actions elicited by willed intentions. Dopamine blocking drugs reduce positive symptoms in Type I patients precisely because they induce Parkinsonism, i.e. reduce the likelihood of actions being initiated by willed intentions. This in turn reduces the likelihood that actions will occur for which the patient had no awareness of his intention to act.",

Notably, accommodative excess due to ocular MG is rare, but may occur with exotropia, with or without diplopia.

Both patients showed ocular motor deficits which appeared to localize to the pons but were instead due to ocular MG.

Essa condição não apenas se manifesta por déficits cognitivos progressivos, mas também por flutuações na atenção e na cognição, alucinações visuais, e sintomas motores que se assemelham aos da doença de Parkinson. Os sintomas podem variar consideravelmente entre os indivíduos, complicando o diagnóstico, que muitas vezes é erroneamente confundido com a doença de Alzheimer ou distúrbios psiquiátricos. O reconhecimento precoce da DCL é fundamental, pois permite a implementação de intervenções terapêuticas que podem melhorar a qualidade de vida dos pacientes, retardar a progressão dos sintomas e aliviar o impacto sobre os cuidadores. A complexidade do quadro clínico é acentuada por distúrbios do sono, que são frequentemente observados em pacientes com DCL e podem afetar significativamente o manejo da condição. Este artigo revisa a literatura atual sobre a DCL, abordando aspectos clínicos, neurobiológicos e opções de tratamento, visando fornecer uma compreensão abrangente dessa condição. Além disso, o estudo destaca a importância dos diagnósticos diferenciais e a necessidade de estratégias terapêuticas personalizadas que levem em consideração a heterogeneidade dos sintomas e as necessidades específicas de cada paciente. A pesquisa contínua sobre a DCL é vital, não apenas para o aprimoramento do diagnóstico e tratamento, mas também para o desenvolvimento de novas abordagens que possam impactar positivamente a vida de milhões de pessoas afetadas por essa doença neurodegenerativa.",

      "abstract": "Fulminant hepatic failure and other causes of multiorgan dysfunction can be associated with seizures. These seizures can be convulsive or nonconvulsive, and may significantly affect the pathobiology of the patient's critical condition. The use of continuous electroencephalography has become very ­important in the identification and treatment of seizures in critically ill patients with hepatic or other metabolic disorders. Seizures arise either as a direct result of the organ failure, or as a result of a secondary metabolic disturbance. ­Correction of the underlying metabolic syndrome may result in the prevention and treatment of the seizures. Secondary organ failure and endocrine abnormalities are commonly seen in the neurocritically ill population, and these patients are more prone to seizures. Organ failure can influence the treatment of both new onset and preexisting seizure disorders by altering the pharmacokinetics of major anticonvulsants. Alternatively, anticonvulsants can precipitate organ failure. Therefore, pharmacotherapy of seizures in these settings should be undertaken cautiously.",

      "abstract": "Dementia is a clinical syndrome with the development of impairment in multiple cognitive functions (including memory), severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living, as the main symptom. There are a large number of disorders that can lead to dementia, and neuropathological examination after death is necessary to determine the underlying cause with certainty. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate neuropathological findings in patients with dementia and neuropathological staging of dementia disorders, the main potential gain being increased epidemiological knowledge and improved neuropathological dementia diagnostics. We could confirm the generally accepted opinion that on a neuropathological basis, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common dementia disorder, followed by vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed AD+VaD. Also, in a significant number of patients, the clinical dementia subtype diagnosis does not correspond with the neuropathological findings. Furthermore, degeneration of the nucleus locus coeruleus, often seen already macroscopically, generally indicates the diagnoses Lewy body disease (LBD) or AD among the demented, while a preserved locus coeruleus occurs mainly in VaD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Moreover, various neuropathological staging systems for AD differ in procedure and targeted pathology, and the choice of system affects the judgement of Alzheimer pathology and hence the final diagnosis. Also, various neuropathological LBD staging systems differ in applicability and to some extent in the judgment of Lewy-related pathology. (Less)",

      "abstract": "Most psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, mood disorders, or neurotic disorders are associated with sleep disorders of various kinds, among which insomnia is most prevalent and important in psychiatric practice. Almost all patients suffering from major depression complain of insomnia. Pharmacological treatment of insomnia associated with major depression shortens the duration to achieve remission of depression. Insomnia has been recently reported to be a risk factor for depression. Hypersomnia is also a major sleep problem in patient suffering from depression. There have been no clinical guide to treat the symptoms of hypersomnia in depression, but some clinical trials treating them with NDRI or adjunctive administration of psychostimulants. In patients with schizophrenia, insomnia is often an early indicator of the aggravation of psychotic symptoms. Electroencephalographic sleep studies have also revealed sleep abnormalities characteristic to mood disorders, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. A shortened REM sleep latency has been regarded as a biological marker of depression. Reduced amount of deep Non-REM sleep has been reported to be correlated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Recently, REM sleep abnormalities were found in teenagers having post-traumatic stress disorder after a boat accident. Although these facts indicate that insomnia plays an important role in the development of psychiatric disorders, there are few hypotheses explaining the cause and effect of insomnia in these disorders. Here, we reviewed recent articles on insomnia and hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorders together with their clinical managements.",

      "title": "Niemann-Pick disease type C symptomatology: an expert-based clinical description",
      "abstract": "Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a rare, progressive, irreversible disease leading to disabling neurological manifestations and premature death. The estimated disease incidence is 1:120,000 live births, but this likely represents an underestimate, as the disease may be under-diagnosed due to its highly heterogeneous presentation. NP-C is characterised by visceral, neurological and psychiatric manifestations that are not specific to the disease and that can be found in other conditions. The aim of this review is to provide non-specialists with an expert-based, detailed description of NP-C signs and symptoms, including how they present in patients and how they can be assessed. Early disease detection should rely on seeking a combination of signs and symptoms, rather than isolated findings. Examples of combinations which are strongly suggestive of NP-C include: splenomegaly and vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (VSGP); splenomegaly and clumsiness; splenomegaly and schizophrenia-like psychosis; psychotic symptoms and cognitive decline; and ataxia with dystonia, dysarthria/dysphagia and cognitive decline. VSGP is a hallmark of NP-C and becomes highly specific of the disease when it occurs in combination with other manifestations (e.g. splenomegaly, ataxia). In young infants (<2 years), abnormal saccades may first manifest as slowing and shortening of upward saccades, long before gaze palsy onset. While visceral manifestations tend to predominate during the perinatal and infantile period (2 months–6 years of age), neurological and psychiatric involvement is more prominent during the juvenile/adult period (>6 years of age). Psychosis in NP-C is atypical and variably responsive to treatment. Progressive cognitive decline, which always occurs in patients with NP-C, manifests as memory and executive impairment in juvenile/adult patients. Disease prognosis mainly correlates with the age at onset of the neurological signs, with early-onset forms progressing faster. Therefore, a detailed and descriptive picture of NP-C signs and symptoms may help improve disease detection and early diagnosis, so that therapy with miglustat (Zavesca®), the only available treatment approved to date, can be started as soon as neurological symptoms appear, in order to slow disease progression.",

Neurophysiological and psychophysiological dysfunctions should be considered in connection with the ubiquitous cognitive dysfunctions. Schizophrenic patients have problems with the integration of information, resulting in deficits of perceptual organization, and in 'metacognitive' deficits of executive functions in the area of behavior and experience. The biological basis of these cognitive functions is in the frontal cortex, but the primary dysfunction seems to be a subcortical one. Negative symptoms can be understood as a secondary exhaustion mechanism, and partly as an adaptive process, corresponding with energetic deficits in information processing. Psychophysiological studies of regional cerebral blood flow, positron emission tomography, electrophysiological recordings and measures of eye tracking point to frontal dysfunction and hypoactivation in patients with negative symptoms. This agrees well with the results of cognitive studies. Psychophysiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying different aspects of the same systems disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Complaints about sleep are common in elderly adults. While changes in sleep architecture occur with normal aging, complaints about sleep are often related to pathological and treatable sleep disturbances. Primary sleep disturbances occurring in older adults include circadian rhythm disturbances, insomnia, sleep disordered breathing, rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and periodic limb movements in sleep. Particularly in older adults, sleep disturbances are likely to represent a multifactorial syndrome in which medical illness, psychiatric illness, and medications play a role. Sleep complaints necessitate the attention of the clinician as they are associated with poor outcomes. Because treatment strategies differ depending on the etiology of the sleep disturbance, a careful and systematic approach to diagnosis is crucial. This chapter reviews the normal changes in sleep that occur with age and sleep disorders frequently seen in older adults including in those with major neurocognitive disorders/dementia. Diagnosis and treatment strategies are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare and potentially dangerous autoimmune neuromuscular disease, which affects the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle. lt is characterized by fluctuating weakness and fatigue of the ocular, bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles and initial symptoms are usually ptosis and diplopia. Over half of patients with MG will initially experience isolated ocular symptoms in one eye or both eyes, which are called ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG). OMG’s diverse symptoms may readily masquerade as other neurological conditions, posing a diagnostic challenge to clinicians. Case presentation: A 49-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with a seven-day history of unilateral persistent ptosis with inflexible eye movement, concerning for oculomotor nerve paralysis initially. However, cranial CTA found no evidence of stroke or any other central etiology. Routine laboratory testing was unremarkable. Neurology was consulted and neurologist recommended sending tensilon testing (pharmacologically induced improvement in symptoms using the anticholinesterase inhibitor) and electromyographic testing. At the patient’s subsequent hospitalization in neurology department, these tests were found to be abnormal. The patient underwent complete ophthalmic examination and medical history review, was diagnosed of ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) eventually. The patient subsequently underwent hormone and immunosuppressive therapy with obvious improvement in her symptoms. Conclusions MG may present as unilateral ptosis or diplopia with the hallmark characteristic of fluctuating muscle weakness. Early diagnosis and subsequent treatment of MG improve long term prognosis and remission rates. Prednisone is the most commonly used immune modulator for the treatment of MG. Emergency physicians should consider myasthenia gravis in cases of ocular symptoms after ruling-out emergent central etiologies.",

LD is a member of the family of progressive myoclonic epilepsies, which are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by myoclonic epilepsy, developmental regression, and associated neurologic symptoms. The following is a report and discussion of a 20-year-old man with no relevant past medical history until the age of 16 years when he had his first generalized tonic-clonic seizure. At a recent medical evaluation, he reported having clusters of generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity 2 to 3 times per week, had recently developed status epilepticus, and was having progressive impairment of cognitive function. The unique clinical elements of LD, including later onset of disease, the excellent initial response to anticonvulsants, and the neurophysiologic clues to the diagnosis are discussed and detailed in relation to this man. Additional research is required to discover a third, unknown locus for LD and to further elucidate the features of the laforin and malin complex-associated pathway.

      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is defined as non-progressive damage to the brain at or around birth, which leads to varying symptoms depending on the extent and location of damage. The leading symptom is sensory-motor impairment of varying expression, but additional perceptual, cognitive, and socio-emotional symptoms are common. CP can be divided into four types, with bilateral spastic being by far the most frequent, followed by the unilateral spastic, the dyskinetic, and the ataxic variants. The intellectual, linguistic, and cognitive profile of CP is extremely variant, but all qualities correlate more or less with CP type and motor impairment. Early diagnosis is important since early intervention may promote all developmental dimensions. Generally, individuals with unilateral spastic CP have the best (almost normal) intellectual, linguistic, and cognitive outcomes, while those with bilateral spastic CP fare the worst. Language perception is often an individual strength, while language expression, and particularly speech, may be heavily impaired. Attention and executive functions are often impaired as compared to typically developing controls, even in those children with normal intellectual functioning. The same holds true for visual perceptual functions, which are impaired in almost half of all children and adolescents with CP. The potential neuropsychological dysfunctions are a risk factor for arithmetic functions and literacy. Obstacles to participate in society are high for individuals with CP and heavily dependent on their motor, language, intellectual, and cognitive functions. However, quality of life is good for most children and adolescents, and they develop a sound self-concept. On the other side, bully experience is more common than amongst typically developing children and is associated with behavior problems and executive dysfunction. The development of children and adolescents with CP is determined by a complex interplay between physical, intellectual, and neuropsychological functions.",

      "abstract": "<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> Visual impairment is a common comorbidity in people living with dementia. Addressing sources of visual difficulties can have a significant impact on the quality of life for people living with dementia and their caregivers. Depth perception problems are purportedly common in dementia and also contribute to falls, visuomotor task difficulties, and poorer psychosocial well-being. However, depth perception and binocular vision are rarely assessed in dementia research. Sleep fragmentation is also common for people living with dementia, and binocular cooperation for depth perception can be affected by fatigue. Pupillary responses under cognitive load also have the potential to be a risk marker for cognitive decline in people living with dementia and can be combined with the above measures for a comprehensive evaluation of clinical visual changes in people living with dementia and their relation to changes in cognitive status, sleep quality, and cortical structure or function. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> This study aims to characterize the nature of clinical visual changes and altered task-evoked pupillary responses that may occur in people living with dementia and evaluate whether these responses relate to changes in cognitive status (standardized Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] score), Pittsburgh sleep quality index, and cortical structure or function. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> This proposed exploratory observational study will enroll ≤210 people with recently diagnosed dementia (within the last 24 months). The following parameters will be assessed on 3 occasions, 4 months apart (plus or minus 2 weeks): visual function (visual acuity and contrast sensitivity), binocular function (motor fusion and stereopsis), task-evoked pupillary responses (minimum and maximum pupil size, time to maximum dilation, and dilation velocity), cognitive status (MMSE score), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). A subset of patients (n=30) with Alzheimer disease will undergo structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging at first and third visits, completing a 10-day consensus sleep diary to monitor sleep quality, verified by sleep actimetry. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> This research was funded in February 2018 and received National Health Service Research Ethics Committee approval in September 2018. The data collection period was from October 1, 2018, to November 30, 2019. A total of 24 participants were recruited for the study. The data analysis is complete, with results expected to be published before the end of 2020. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> Findings will demonstrate how often people with dementia experience binocular vision problems. If frequent, diagnosing and treating them could improve quality of life by reducing the risk of falls and fine visuomotor task impairment and by relieving psychosocial anxiety. This research will also demonstrate whether changes in depth perception, pupillary responses, and quality of vision relate to changes in memory or sleep quality and brain structure or function. If related, these quick and noninvasive eye tests help monitor dementia. This would help justify whether binocular vision and pupillary response testing should be included in dementia-friendly eye-testing guidelines. </sec> <sec> <title>INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT</title> RR1-10.2196/16089 </sec>",

Several other clinical and imaging features are highly suggestive such as the presence of rapid eye movement sleep disorder, severe sensitivity to neuroleptics and specific neuroimaging abnormalities. Therapeutic strategies include prescription of L-dopa and cholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine, and avoidance of anticholinergic medications and neuroleptics.

Brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP), somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) can be affected together, but isolated abnormalities are more frequently observed. Diffuse neuropathological changes have been found in the optic nerves, periventricular regions, brainstem and spinal cord in postmortem pathological studies. Similar changes have been found in animals with experimental diabetes. The pathophysiology of central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities is uncertain, many causes are probably active in including neural damage: chronic hyperglycemia, hypoglycemic episodes, angiopathy, blood-brain barrier dysfunction and others, still unknown.",

      "abstract": "Psychogenic or functional movement disorders (PMDs) may occur at almost any age, particularly those affecting vulnerable populations. Mostly, that are not explained by an specifiable organic disease and that especially related to psychiatric underlying cause. Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

This may also be disassociated, affecting only one type of eye movements, and this suggests supranuclear lesions. Concerting lateral movements, complete paralysis of abduction, adduction (sparing convergence) or ipsilateral laterality is suggestive of damage to the radicular fibres of the abducencs nucleus (VI), to its internuclear neurons or to the nucleus itself respectively. Isolated paralysis of saccades is in favour of a lesion of the paramedian pontine reticular formation. As regards vertical movements, paralysis of the oculomotor nerve (III), either isolated or associated with complete paralysis of the contralateral rectus superior oculi muscle, suggests a lesion of the radicular fibres of III or of the nucleus itself respectively. Paralysis of downward or both downward and upward saccades indicates the presence of bilateral lesions in the region of the mesencephalic reticular formation. Paralysis of upward saccades alone reflects a unilateral lesion located near the posterior commissure.",

      "abstract": "Objectives \"Epileptic dementia\" is reported in adults with childhood-onset refractory epilepsy. Cognitive deterioration can also occur in a \"second-hit model\". Materials and methods We studied the clinical and neuropsychological characteristics of patients with cognitive deterioration (≥1 SD discrepancy between current IQ and premorbid IQ). Memory function, reaction time and processing speed were also evaluated. Analyses were performed to investigate which clinical characteristics correlated with cognitive deterioration. Results Twenty-seven patients were included with a mean age of 55.7 years old, an average age at epilepsy onset of 33.9 years and a mean duration of 21.8 years. Over 40% had experienced at least one status epilepticus. About 77.8% had at least one comorbid disease (most of (cardio)vascular origin). Cognitive deterioration scores were significant for both Performance IQ and Full Scale IQ, but not for Verbal IQ. Impairments in fluid functions primarily affected the IQ-scores. Memory was not impaired. Epilepsy factors explained 7% of the variance in deterioration, whereas 38% was explained by relatively low premorbid IQ and educational level, high age at seizure onset and older age. Conclusions A subgroup of patients with localization-related epilepsy exhibits cognitive decline characterized by deterioration in PIQ and FSIQ, but with preserved higher order functions (VIQ and memory). Patients typically have epilepsia tarda, comorbid pathology, relatively low educational level and older age. These are factors known to increase the vulnerability of the brain by diminishing cognitive reserve. Cognitive deterioration may develop according to a stepwise \"second-hit model\", affecting and accelerating the cognitive ageing process.",

      "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment is a significant risk factor for a host of psychiatric, developmental, medical, and neurocognitive conditions, often resulting in debilitating and long-term consequences. However, there is no available neuropsychological resource reviewing the literature on the associated neurocognitive deficits in children and adolescents. This review comprehensively examines the 23 prior studies that evaluated the intellectual, language, visual-spatial, memory, motor, and/or attention/executive functions in children and adolescents following an experience of childhood abuse and/or neglect. Neurocognitive impairments were frequently reported. Impairments in executive functions were the most frequent and severe reported impairments, although intelligence, language, visual-spatial skills, and memory are also at serious risk for compromised development following maltreatment. However, specific factors such as abuse/neglect duration, severity, type, and timing during development were all associated with neurocognition. This indicates that these factors are of greater importance than just the presence of abuse/neglect in identifying risk for neurocognitive compromise. Such neurocognitive deficits appear to be a consequence to the known neurobiological and brain development abnormalities of this population, suggesting traumatic stress can be a potential cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings have critical implications for the clinical practice and research involving children following childhood maltreatment and other types of traumatic stress.",

      "abstract": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is characterized by behavioral or cognitive change from baseline for at least 30 minutes with EEG evidence of seizures. Categorized into complex partial status epilepticus (with lateralized seizures), and generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus (bilateral diffuse synchronous seizures), there is debate regarding the diagnosis and morbidity of NCSE. Because EEG is needed for diagnosis, only a high index of suspicion leads to a request for the study, whereas EEG is often unavailable after hours or on weekends. Furthermore, the cognitive changes during NCSE are often incorrectly ascribed to a postictal state, intoxication, psychogenic or psychotic states, and mental retardation. Regarding categorization, present classifications address EEG features but fail to distinguish among depths of coma. Deeply comatose patients (with coma etiologies that themselves carry poor prognoses) are mixed with lightly obtunded patients with no morbidity, confusing the prognosis. Thus, a classification that subsumes depth of coma, and possibly etiology, is sorely warranted. Regarding treatment, comatose NCSE patients treated with benzodiazepines may worsen, whereas generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus patients may suffer iatrogenically from aggressive treatment (hypotension and respiratory depression) necessitating balancing the potential neurologic morbidity of NCSE against the possible morbidity of IV antiepileptic drugs. A high index of suspicion is needed to initiate EEG studies. Better stratification of level of consciousness will be needed to distinguish among morbidity due to underlying conditions, treatment, and the effects of status epilepticus, proper.",

Both stages include moderate to severe impairment or damage to the colour-opponent (and most likely the fine-acuity) system.

The clinical phenotype in females with SBH varies widely with cognitive abilities that range from average or mild cognitive impairment to severe intellectual disability and language impairment. Seizures, which frequently are refractory to antiepileptic medication, may be either focal or generalized and behavioral problems may also be observed. In DCX-related lissencephaly and SBH the severity of the clinical manifestation correlates roughly with the degree of the underlying brain malformation as observed in cerebral imaging. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a DCX-related disorder is established in a proband by identification of a DCX pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Antiepileptic drugs for epileptic seizures; deep brain stimulation may improve the seizure disorder in individuals with SBH; special feeding strategies in newborns with poor suck; physical therapy to promote mobility and prevent contractures; special adaptive chairs or positioners as needed; occupational therapy to improve fine motor skills and oral-motor control; participation in speech therapy, educational training, and enrichment programs. Surveillance: Regular neurologic examination and monitoring of seizure activity, EEG, and antiepileptic drug levels; regular measurement of height, weight, and head circumference; evaluation of feeding and nutrition status; assessment of psychomotor, speech, and cognitive development; prompt consultation in the event of novel neurologic findings or deterioration, aspiration, or infections; monitoring for orthopedic complications such as foot deformity or scoliosis. Genetic counseling DCX-related disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. Up to10% of unaffected mothers of children with a DCX pathogenic variant are presumed to have germline mosaicism with or without somatic mosaicism. A woman who is heterozygous for a DCX pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy. Hemizygous male offspring usually manifest DCX-related classic lissencephaly, while heterozygous female offspring may be asymptomatic or more frequently manifest a wide phenotypic spectrum of SBH. If the pathogenic variant has been identified in the family, testing to determine the genetic status of at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible.",

      "title": "1429 Assessing the Neurodegenerative Progression of REM Behavior Disorder and Trauma Associated Sleep Disorder with Cutaneous Alpha-Synuclein Testing",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Isolated rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is one of the earliest and most specific prodromal signs of α-synuclein driven neurodegenerative disease including Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. Trauma Associated Sleep Disorder (TASD) overlaps significantly with iRBD, with features of both dream enactment and REM without atonia; however, it remains unclear if TASD also represents a prodromal neurodegenerative disease. Cutaneous phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (P-Syn) is a sensitive and specific biomarker of α-synuclein; however, rates of P-Syn positive in TSAD are unknown. Report of case A 35-year-old man with medical history of major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder was referred for the evaluation of sleep violence and dream enactment. He reported weekly nightmares with dream enactment that have been persistent for a few years. Most of these actions were typically in response to nightmares related to his time in Afghanistan. He denied other prodromal symptoms including hyposmia, cognitive impairment, or autonomic dysfunction. Video polysomnogram confirmed the presence of REM without atonia. Autonomic testing including measures of sudomotor, cardiovagal, and sympathetic adrenergic function was normal. Skin biopsy was performed at the C7 paraspinal area, proximal and distal leg and processed for immunohistochemical analysis of P-Syn. All sites were normal without denervation of P-syn deposition. Conclusion A diagnosis of RBD or TASD can be distressing for patients due to the risk of progression to a debilitating neurocognitive disorder. This case illustrates the utility of synuclein testing in further distinguishing RBD and TASD. Skin biopsies are usually well-tolerated by patients and can offer an objective approach to characterizing disease severity and progression. Further studies are needed in larger cohorts to confirm absence of P-Syn in TASD. Support (if any)",

      "title": "Recognizing subacute sclerosing panencephalitis",
      "abstract": "A DEVASTATING COMPLICATION OF measles infection, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is also called Dawson encephalitis. This disease develops following infection with a rubeola virus that has mutated. Usually fatal, it develops 2 to 10 years after the patient recovers from rubeola. Why the virus mutates in some people isn't known. Because of widespread measles vaccination, SSPE is uncommon in the United States, but it remains widespread in India and the Middle East. Most patients are children and young adults up to age 35. Subtle early signs Initially, signs and symptoms may be subtle and nonspecific: irritability, intellectual deterioration, and memory loss without apparent neurologic signs. A child may have trouble with schoolwork or develop behavior problems. As the disease progresses, he experiences progressive motor and mental deterioration with myoclonus (involuntary movement and seizurelike activity), the hallmark of SSPE. He loses the ability to walk, speak, or swallow and may become blind. Without treatment, most patients die within 3 years of disease onset. Diagnosis is based on a history of measles infection and physical examination. A neurologic assessment may reveal optic nerve or retinal damage, poor motor coordination, and myoclonus. An electroencephalogram may be normal in early stages; later, changes typical of SSPE appear, reflecting progressive deterioration of the central nervous system. A serum measles antibody titer may be elevated, and a spinal tap may reveal elevated rubeola antibodies. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging may be ordered to determine the degree of white matter changes and atrophy. Supportive care Treatment for SSPE, which is primarily supportive and palliative, includes antiviral treatment and anticonvulsant therapy to control seizures. Oral isoprinosine, an antiviral orphan drug approved to treat SSPE, may slow disease progression. It may be combined with other drugs, such as interferon beta, interferon alpha, and ribavirin, although no controlled studies have been done to establish the effectiveness of various regimens. Patients who respond to these treatments usually continue receiving them for the rest of their lives. If you're caring for a child with SSPE, provide ongoing support to the child and his parents. Assess the child's nutritional needs, including his ability to eat and swallow, and prepare him for enteral feeding if indicated. Facilitate physical, occupational, and speech therapy to maintain optimal quality of life. Finally, provide information about respite and hospice resources that can help the family deal with terminal illness. Amy Wisniewski is a case manager for Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pa.

      "abstract": "AIM To provide an overview of those neurological disorders that are mainly characterized by a paroxysmal pattern of involvement, and in which a clear genetic or metabolic etiology has been identified. DEVELOPMENT The term 'paroxysmal' refers to the abrupt onset of clinical manifestations in a relatively stereotyped manner, usually upon exposure to specific triggering factors with an almost complete resolution of such findings between attacks. They are commonly not associated to either a relentless progression or a stepwise deterioration, and the majority of them do not lead to the development of gross neuropathological abnormalities. Although they are difficult to classify due to the heterogeneity of their clinical manifestations and underlying deficits, a neuroaxis-based approach is proposed for practical purposes, for example, from those conditions affecting predominantly cortical grey matter (manifesting mainly with seizures) to those with an almost exclusive muscular and/or neuromuscular pattern of involvement. The majority of them are caused by genetic defects in either transporters or neuronal channels, which can be either ions or neurotransmitters. In recent years, the concept of 'channelopathies' has grown in acceptance in the medical field, although not all of the described disorders are caused by defects in molecular channels. CONCLUSIONS Despite their individual rarity, as a group, they are important to the neurologist due to the advances that their understanding have provided for the development of the field of neurogenetics and neurosciences in general.",

      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

      "abstract": "There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the relationships among impaired insight, symptoms, and neurocognition in schizophrenia. The inconsistent findings likely reflect the multidimensionality of insight in this population, along with variations in study design. We examined 46 individuals with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were recently discharged from an inpatient unit. Insight was operationalized as awareness of having a mental disorder and awareness and attribution of both current and past symptoms. Positive, negative, disorganized, and depression symptoms were rated, and a neurocognition battery, including measures of visual processing, memory, visuo-spatial ability, and executive functions, was administered. Poor awareness of symptoms was moderately associated with core schizophrenia symptoms, and higher levels of depression were strongly associated with good awareness. Symptom misattribution, more so than symptom unawareness, was associated with deficits in frontal lobe functioning. Finally, different patterns of associations between symptoms, neurocognition, and insight were noted for current symptoms versus past symptoms. The data suggest that insight deficits in schizophrenia are multidimensional, and that investigators should pay careful attention to the choice of measures as well as to phase of illness characteristics in future studies.",

Phenomenological details of visitor experiences are expected to reflect the functions of deep temporal lobe structures; common details involve cosmic meaningfulness, vestibular experiences, flickering, complex visual sensations and alimentary references. After intense experiences, interictal-like behaviors similar to religious conversions (widening affect, sense of personal, desire to spread the word, concern about Man's destiny) emerge. Normal people who are prone to these experiences show frequent temporal lobe signs and specific personality characteristics that include enhanced creativity, suggestibility, mild hypomania, anxiety, and emotional lability. Learning histories that encourage the use of right temporal lobe functions for the consolidation of memory, such as compartmentalization of beliefs or repression due to early sexual abuse, predispose to intense visitor experiences. The most frequent precipitants are psychological depression, personal (existential) stress and proximal exposure to the focal tectonic strain fields that accompany luminous phenomena.

      "title": "Regional cerebral glucose metabolism in children with deterioration of one or more cognitive functions and continuous spike-and-wave discharges during sleep",
      "abstract": "The Landau—Kleffner syndrome(LKS) and the syndrome of continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow sleep(CSWS) were originally described, and are still considered, separately. The former combines an acquired aphasia with spike-and wave discharges that are activated by slow wave sleep, behavioural disturbances, and sometimes epileptic seizures. The latter is characterized by continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow wave sleep, usually combined with global intellectual deterioration and epileptic seizures. These two syndromes share many common features: (i) onset during childhood; (ii) deterioration of cognitive functions that were previously normally acquired; (iii) seizer type; (iv) EEG pattern; (v) pharmocological reactivity; (vi) regression of the neuropsychological symptoms, of the EEG abnormalities and of the seizers before the end of adolescence; (vii) absence of obvoious strucural lesion detected by CT or MRI scan. Therefore, we postulated that thease patients might, in fact, be presenting several facets of a single process associating the deterioration of cognitive functions and continuous spike-and-wave discharges during slow wave sleep. The pathogenesis of this syndrome remains unknown. Seven patients, presenting CSWS associated with neuropsychological deterioration (isolated aphasia, three cases; language disturbances with more widespread cognitive deterioration, three cases; isolated apraxia, one cases) were studied using PET with l 18 Flfluorodexyglucose (FDG). We hoped to find metabolic arguments in favour of a unifying hypothesis, and to reveal clues as to pathogenesis. We present the retrospective analysis of 21 studies performed between 1986 and 1993, 12 of which were done during sleep. For three of these patients, follow-up studies were obtained until recovery. The metabolic patterns were very variable from one patient to another and in the same patient over time. Among the six patients studied during the active phase of the affection, our results showed unilateral, focal or regional increase in glucose metabolism of the cortex in five patients. This hypermetabolism was observed during sleep with continuous spike-and-wave discharges, but also persisted during wakefulness. In the last patient, the metaboic pattern was different: decreased regional glucose metabolism was observed during wakefulness, whereas during sleep, the metabolic pattern in the temporal areas varied during the course of the affection. After recovery, the metabolic pattern in four children (including the seventh patient) was either normal or jshowed focal or regional, uni-or bilateral decrease in cortical glucose metabolism. Despite this apparent disparity, four basic metabolic characteristics formed a common pattern in all patients, in line with our unifying postulate: (i) the metabolic pattern is characteristic of an immature brain. (ii) The metabolic abnormalities involved focal or regional areas of the cotex. This finding is in good agreement with recent neurophysiological data suggesting a focal origin of the spike-and-wave discharges. (iii) The matabolic disturbances predominantly involved deterioration is in good agreement of neuropsychological deterioration is in good agreement with the topography of the disturbances of cortical glucose matabolism. (iv) The thalamic nucleiremained symmetrical despite significant cortical asymmertries, suggesting either that cortico-thalamic neurons do not participate in the generation of spike-and-wave discharges or that they are inhibited by the pathologic mechanisms. we hypothesize that the acquired deterioration of cognitive function with CSWS is caused by an alteration of the maturation of one or several associative cortices, primarily involving local interneurons and cortico-cortical associative neurons.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders Among the Visually Impaired",
      "abstract": "Introduction and Definition: Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are characterized by delusions, visual and/or auditory hallucinations, disorganized thinking and speech, abnormal motor behavior, and negative emotional symptoms. Although the cause of these disorders remains unknown, hallucinations stand out as a prominent symptom. Historically, research on visual hallucinations in blind or visually impaired individuals has been limited. This entry aims to explore the existing data concerning the relationship between vision and symptoms of psychotic disorders, with an emphasis on visual hallucinations. Current Research: Research indicates a correlation between schizophrenia and deteriorating eye health, likely stemming from prolonged visual hallucinations and the medications used to manage schizophrenia. Childhood blindness has been identified as a protective factor against psychosis, highlighting the role of glutamate receptors in the accuracy of prediction errors related to visual hallucinations. In older individuals with declining vision, Charles Bonnet syndrome stands as a notable exception, representing a cause of visual hallucinations linked to significant vision loss rather than a psychotic disorder. Implications: There are no reported cases of schizophrenia among congenitally blind individuals. However, several studies on hallucinogenic drugs, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), in congenitally blind individuals have found that, rather than experiencing visual hallucinations, they report alterations in other senses, such as touch. This suggests that congenital blindness may serve as a protective factor against schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, whereas late-onset vision loss does not confer the same protection. Future Directions: Future efforts should prioritize destigmatizing psychotic disorders and promote more research on nonpsychotic disorders that present with visual hallucination symptoms, such as Charles Bonnet and Usher syndrome. This is particularly important given that many individuals with these disorders refrain from reporting their visual hallucinations due to fear of being misidentified as mentally ill and concerns about potential hospitalization. Targeted Interventions: Research on the origins of visual hallucinations—whether they involve the brain, the eyes, or both—suggests that targeting the serotonin-glutamate system in therapy can improve visual hallucination symptoms in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Furthermore, clinical interventions that target neurocognitive assessments help to individualize treatment based on personal symptoms and neural processing.",

Sleep-disordered breathing resulting from these disorders may take the form of periodic central or obstructive apneas or hypopneas or sustained hypoventilation; all forms generally worsen during rapid eye movement sleep. Clinical manifestations commonly include nocturnal sleep disturbances such as insomnia and snoring and daytime symptoms such as hypersomnolence and cognitive impairment. Treatment depends on the specific pattern of respiratory impairment during sleep and may include ventilatory support modalities, nasal continuous positive airway pressure, or various pharmacologic maneuvers.",

      "title": "Physical symptoms of depression: unmet needs.",
      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

In this presentation, classical genetic disorders affecting the optic nerve will be discussed with a particular focus on Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). LHON is a primary mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorder and three point mutations within the mitochondrial genome account for the vast majority of cases, namely: m.3460G>A, m.11778G>A and m.14484T>C. It typically affects young adult males who present with bilateral severe visual loss in the second or third decade of life. In addition to the canonical LHON mutations, other pathogenic mtDNA mutations have been reported that can result in both syndromic and non-syndromic optic neuropathies. Acute visual loss in genetic disorders can also be secondary to pathology involving the retrochiasmal visual pathways, for example, in MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes). The cardinal clinical manifestations in this group of patients are homonymous hemianopic visual field defects or cortical blindness.",

It consists of two opposite states, manic state and depressive state. Typical manic symptoms include a pathologic delightful mood, flight of ideas, heightened level of activity and sexual interest. Grandiosity, rapid and pressured speech, increased energy and decreased need for sleep are also frequently seen. On the other hand, depressive symptoms are characterized by prolonged depressive mood, inhibition of thought, lowered level of activity, depressive ideas or delusions and various somatic dysfunctions such as loss of appetite and sleep disturbance. Mood disorders are often seen in association with organic brain diseases, collagen diseases such as SLE, some endocrinological diseases and medication. Diagnosis of manic or depressive states is usually carried out by careful psychiatric interviews. No specific somatic symptoms or signs have been identified for manic-depressive illness. Many rating scales, for instance Zung's SDS or HDSR, have been utilized as diagnostic aids. Rating scales and the symptomatology and diagnosis of manic-depressive illness are described in general.",

      "abstract": "Although the risk of developing dementia increases with age, onset can be as early as the third or fourth decade of life. Genetic influences play a more important role in younger than in older people with dementia, so young onset dementia may cluster in families. Diagnosing young onset dementia is challenging. The range of possible presenting features is broad, encompassing behavioural, cognitive, psychiatric and neurological domains, and symptoms are often subtle initially. Frequently the complaints are misattributed to stress or depression, and the patient is falsely reassured that they are too young to have dementia. The most common causes of young onset dementia are early onset forms of adult neurodegenerative conditions and alcohol. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of young onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Conventional vascular risk factors may be absent and diagnosis relies on imaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease. Obtaining a detailed history remains the most important part of the workup and usually requires corroboration by a third party. Undertaking a basic neurological examination is also important. Those with suspected young onset dementia should be referred to a neurology-led cognitive disorders clinic where available as the differenti diagnosis is considerably broader tha in older adults and requires specialist investigation.",

Damage to the blood supply to the brain often resulting in minor strokes, vascular dementia, is less common with the better control of high blood pressure and reduction in smoking. The majority of people living with dementia will have a neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's, characterised by loss of memory. Other causes include dementia with Lewy bodies that overlaps with Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal degeneration. The latter most commonly presents with changes in behaviour such as disinhibition, loss of empathy and stereotypies. It can also present with speech and language deficits.

      "title": "Hypertension and cognition decline: Is there an ultimate link?",
      "abstract": "The relationship between arterial hypertension and impairment of cognition is a matter of great importance since the prevention of hypertension, early intervention, and adequate control of blood pressure could modify the current high prevalence and global incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. MCI is considered to be an intermediate stage between the loss of normal cognitive aging and dementia, with maintenance of daily life activities. It is associated with a substantially increased risk of developing dementia. The impairment of cognition can occur in one or more areas that work in an integrated way, such as attention, perception, processing, memory, reasoning, visualization, problem solving, execution, and expression of information. A clinical diagnosis of dementia is defined when cognitive losses interfere with social or occupational activities.1 The dementia of Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent, followed by vascular dementia and mixed dementia. There are many hypotheses linking elevated blood pressure to MCI or dementia such as endothelial dysfunction, reduced beta-amyloid clearance, excessive blood pressure dipping or nondipping during sleep, white matter disease (leukoaraiosis), association of hypertension and insulin resistance with abnormal insulin signaling in the brain, and pharmacological factors.2 Some questions remain unanswered, such as whether elevated blood pressure at all ages induces cognitive impairment. The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study showed that midlife systolic blood pressure was a predictor of reduced cognition function in later life,3 as also did the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin Study, which verified a 10-year change with lower cognition function and decreased brain volume in subjects with high systolic blood pressure in midlife.4 Recently, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Cohort also showed that midlife hypertension, prehypertension, diabetes and smoking were associated with an increased risk of dementia.5 However, it is still unclear if high blood pressure values in older people may contribute to cognitive impairment in the young, elderly and in the very old adults.6 Some studies have shown the association of high blood pressure with reduced cognition,7, 8 others have shown the effect of the U9, 10 curve or even better cognition among centenarians with higher blood pressure,11, 12 probably due to the maintenance of cerebral perfusion in individuals with less regulation of this flow. In this context, Wei et al,13 in a study of a very large sample (6732) of Chinese Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS) participants aged 45 years and over, without dementia, without stroke, cancer, renal failure or psychiatric problems, for blood pressure and episodic memory and executive function, found that treated but uncontrolled hypertension and high systolic blood pressure may be risk factors for cognitive decline in people aged 60-74. In people ≥75 years, untreated hypertension, treated but uncontrolled hypertension, and high pulse pressure may predict cognitive degeneration. Higher pulse pressure denotes greater stiffness of the arteries, with a reduction of aortic compliance. A recent study showed a reduction of resting cerebral flow in the elderly with greater aortic stiffness, even without changes in vascular reactivity in the brain. In older people with mild cognitive impairment and apolipoprotein E4, there was a more intense reduction of flow in the temporal region.14 Arterial stiffness was associated with beta-amyloid plaque deposition in the brain, independent of blood pressure or the presence of apoprotein E4.15 Questions are being raised about the greater importance of average blood pressure compared to the values of the pulse pressure (pulsatile component) or the variability of blood pressure as markers of risk for cognitive decline. An epidemiological study determined the association of higher pulse pressure with worse cognition in the elderly, without the influence of mean arterial pressure.16 The variability of blood pressure monitored visit by visit showed greater association with cognitive decline than mean blood pressure in middle-aged and elderly individuals.17 In a study of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in subjects aged 65 years and over for 5 years, it was found that a greater variability of blood pressure during the daytime period was associated with worse cognitive function.18 Longitudinal studies have also shown conflicting results in detecting cognitive impairment in elderly individuals with high blood pressure,19 but most of them support the view that the risk of dementia increases with arterial hypertension.20, 21 Another unresolved question is whether treatment of hypertension could prevent cognitive decline, or even what would be the ideal goal of control in the elderly and very old to obtain this benefit. By blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, it is believed that aldosterone reduction and AT1 receptor blockade could have an impact on better cognition through the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).22, 23 Furthermore, it is known that the AT2 receptors are responsible for reducing cellular proliferation and higher regeneration, besides vasodilatation. They are stimulated by ARBs, which can be seen as potential neural protective factors. The secondary analysis of data from a longitudinal study showed benefits with the use of diuretics, ACEIs, and ARBs.24 A meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials involving the use of several antihypertensive drugs versus placebo did not show a benefit in the prevention of dementia with the treatment of hypertension in the elderly.25 A more recent meta-analysis suggested a protective effect of calcium channels blockers (CBB) against the risk of dementia in elderly patients.26 There could be a protective effect of CCBs by preventing calcium entry into cells, which would promote less apoptosis and cell death. Comparing the control goal recommended by the Eighth Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 8) for elderly people with SBP lower than 150 mm Hg,27 with the goal recommended by the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) of a SBP level lower than 120 mm Hg SPRINT,28 there was less loss of cognition in individuals with more intense control, especially among black people.29 However, it should be noted that this study was not randomized to control goals, with cognition being observed for 10 years in subgroups of individuals who had blood pressure in different control ranges. A subanalysis of the SPRINT study, SPRINT Memory and Cognition in Decreased Hypertension (SPRINT MIND) answered some questions about the ideal goal of blood pressure to preserve cognition in cardiovascular high-risk, nondiabetic, stroke-free subjects. In the Alzheimer´s Association International Conference, the SPRINT MIND researchers presented preliminary results with a significant reduction in 19% in relative risk for MCI (P = 0.01), with nonsignificant reduction in probable dementia. Participants in the SPRINT trial that were submitted to magnetic resonance imaging (n = 454, 67.4%) had lower increase in volume of white matter lesions in the intensive treatment group (P = 0.004) after 3.98 years of follow-up. Total brain volume decreased in the intensive treatment and in the standard treatment groups, without significant difference.30 The current advance in research in this specific area is unquestionable. Although we do not yet know whether treatment of hypertension at any age, as well as the control of other known cardiovascular risk factors, would result in effective benefits in reducing MCI and dementia, and the ideal intensity of these interventions for all subgroups of patients, it is possible that this strategy will be as effective or even more effective in reducing the worldwide impact of dementia in the future than other specific medications that are being developed to prevent the advance of cerebral degeneration.

Sensory nerve biopsies in IDN showed perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, decreased fiber density, increased demyelination, and axonal degeneration. Most patients with IDN improved with immunotherapy.Features that favor IDN over DPN are limb weakness, more severe nerve conduction abnormalities, inflammatory infiltrates on nerve biopsy, and a favorable response to immunotherapy. A nerve biopsy can help establish an inflammatory cause.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Illness behavior refers to the ways in which symptoms are perceived, understood, acted upon, and communicated and include facial grimacing, holding or supporting the affected body part, limping, using a cane, and stooping while walking. Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

With the advent of spasticity or opisthotonus, they may be first thought to have cerebral palsy. Patients with argininemia may have episodic vomiting and hyperammonemia. The clinical features may include progressive gait abnormalities due to spasticity, as well as acute episodes of ataxia, behavior disturbances (aggression, hyperactivity, and irritability), vomiting, lethargy, and seizures.",

The eye response, motor response, brainstem reflexes, and respiration pattern (FOUR) score and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score are two standard scoring systems for uniform, quantitative, and objective assessment of the severity of illness and predicting outcomes in neurocritical care. It is not clear which score has better calibration and discrimination power in predicting critical patients' outcomes. The debate has different implications for children as scoring systems face unique challenges when they are used for critically ill children. The GCS has been regularly utilized in neurosurgical ICUs, but its dependability in predicting patient outcomes is continuously debated.[1] The FOUR score is an indicator of the prognosis of fundamentally sick patients which has significant favorable circumstances.[2] [3] The FOUR score depends on the absolute minimum of tests essential for evaluating a patient with altered consciousness by incorporating many essential data that is not surveyed by the GCS or other scales. It includes the estimation of brainstem reflexes, determination of eye-opening, a broad spectrum of motor responses, and the presence of anomalous breath rhythms and a respiratory drive.[4]",

      "title": "Report from the <scp>WPA</scp> Section on Psychiatry and Sleep‐Wakefulness Disorders",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, which is considered a psychiatric disorder itself, is the most common sleep-related complaint in the general population. Furthermore, complaints about sleep and wakefulness are among the most common and impairing symptoms in psychiatric patients. Disturbed sleep frequently precedes the onset of several mental disorders, exacerbates as mental disorders progress, and frequently presents as a residual and treatment-resistant symptom. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in sleep research and the treatment of sleep and wakefulness disorders in psychiatry, although many questions remain to be answered1. We still do not know exactly the causative link(s) between the various psychiatric disorders and sleep complaints, although it would be important to know, for instance, whether early treatment of sleep disturbances can prevent the development of depressive disorders. Moreover, the relationship between subjective complaints of insomnia patients and objective polysomnographic results remains elusive, and we do not know whether the health consequences of insomnia, for example on metabolic systems, are related to subjective or objective measures of sleep, or both. Besides objective methods for assessing sleep and wakefulness – such as polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, multiple sleep latency test, and maintenance of wakefulness test – there is now considerable literature on various biomarkers for sleep disorders. For insomnia, the measures with the highest performance include PSG-derived cyclic alternating patterns, actigraphy, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. These are followed by heart rate around sleep onset, deficient melatonin rhythm, and specific neuroimaging patterns, mainly reflecting the activity of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia2. For central disorders of hypersomnolence, novel measures derived from quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), high-density EEG, cognitive testing, structural and functional neuroimaging, and pupillometry have been proposed3. Significant progress has also been made in the assessment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. In addition to established laboratory protocols, circadian rhythms can now be assessed through long-term ambulatory monitoring of activity, skin temperature, heart rate, and light exposure4. Significant progress has also been made in the treatment of insomnia, emphasizing not only the role of appropriate pharmacotherapy but, above all, non-pharmacological treatment options. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is currently recommended as the evidence-based psychotherapy for chronic insomnia, also in patients with comorbidities5. This treatment includes techniques such as sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep education and hygiene, relaxation techniques, and cognitive restructuring. These techniques help strengthen the basic sleep-regulating mechanisms, including the homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm, and reduce sleep-related anxiety and arousal6. The treatment of insomnia in psychiatry should be based on an integration of pharmacotherapy (including novel medications, such as orexin antagonists) and non-pharmacological interventions, to address psychological and behavioral factors that contribute to the development or persistence of insomnia. It is particularly important to emphasize the need to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, getting up at the same time every day, even after a night of poor sleep, and to exercise regularly. Additionally, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and limiting naps and rest periods during the day are essential. To prevent insomnia, it is also important to limit screen time during the day and avoid screens (phones, tablets, TVs) at least one hour before bed. Several new wakefulness-promoting agents have been introduced for the treatment of central disorders of hypersomnolence7. Moreover, it is now well recognized that effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with mental disorders is critical for improving their response to treatment, quality of life, and overall health7. As the prevalence of sleep and wakefulness disorders has further increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in deterioration of mental health and increased alcohol and hypnotic use8, it is evident that mental health professionals require effective training in diagnosing and treating disrupted sleep. People with mental disorders can greatly benefit from mental health services that incorporate routine assessment and treatment of sleep and wakefulness disorders within standard care pathways. Consequently, the main aim of the WPA Section on Psychiatry and Sleep-Wakefulness Disorders is to educate psychiatrists in recognizing and giving appropriate attention to sleep disturbances (such as insomnia and hypersomnolence) and in being able to provide guidance to their patients on the importance of basic sleep hygiene rules. The education of psychiatrists should also include awareness on obstructive sleep apnea, which can manifest with psychiatric symptoms, including increased daytime sleepiness, fatigue or loss of energy, loss of interest or pleasure, irritability, mood swings, emotional instability, and cognitive dysfunction such as impaired memory, attention and executive functions. These psychiatric manifestations highlight the importance of diagnosing and treating sleep apnea promptly, as managing the sleep disorder can improve overall well-being and quality of life. Moreover, since 30-40% of patients with chronic insomnia fulfill diagnostic criteria for obstructive sleep apnea, screening for this condition should be performed before initiating any hypnotic medication. This is crucial, because medications such as benzodiazepines are contraindicated in patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea. Such screening can be performed with short questionnaires such as the STOP-BANG. This questionnaire consists of eight yes-or-no questions, focusing on snoring, tiredness, observed apneas, pressure (high blood pressure), body mass index, age, neck circumference, and gender (male). Each \"yes\" answer scores one point. A higher total score indicates a greater risk of obstructive sleep apnea9. Our WPA Section has been active for many years. Its activities have been focused on providing information about sleep and sleep-related disorders to clinical health professionals, as well as optimizing the diagnosis and therapy of sleep disturbances in patients with mental disorders. Since sleep is an interdisciplinary field, one of our main goals is to connect sleep specialists from around the world. We believe that our Section can mediate between basic researchers, clinicians, educational institutions, scientific professional societies, health care institutions, and governmental authorities, in order to improve the recognition and treatment of sleep disorders. Our Section's action plan for 2023-2026 includes several goals. A primary one is advancing research and knowledge about disturbances of sleep and wakefulness in patients with mental disorders, by fostering collaboration between basic researchers, clinical scientists, and health care providers. Additionally, we will keep focusing on education and training on diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, by organizing workshops, webinars and scientific conferences with WPA involvement. Furthermore, we will be active in promoting clinical practice guidelines, to improve the quality and interdisciplinary nature of care in people with mental disorders suffering from disturbed sleep. A major goal also pertains to engaging in policy and advocacy, by calling for pertinent actions in support of research and public health initiatives to improve access of patients with mental disorders to sleep medicine services. We will also be supporting the building up of networking and collaboration, by fostering relationships with scientific societies to promote interdisciplinary research and clinical care. To this end, our Section has already organized a highly successful symposium, \"State of the Art in the Management of Insomnia\", during the World Congress of Psychiatry in 2023. Finally, we intend to develop public sleep health campaigns to educate the public on sleep hygiene, health consequences of poor sleep, and prevention of sleep disorders. By implementing this action plan, our Section can play a pivotal role in advancing the field, improving patient care, and promoting the importance of sleep health in the broader mental health context.",

      "title": "Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is characterized by recurrent acute sensory and motor neuropathy in a single or multiple nerves. The most common initial manifestation is the acute onset of a non-painful focal sensory and motor neuropathy in a single nerve (mononeuropathy). The first attack usually occurs in the second or third decade but earlier onset is possible. Neuropathic pain is increasingly recognized as a common manifestation. Recovery from acute neuropathy is usually complete; when recovery is not complete, the resulting disability is mild. Some affected individuals also demonstrate a mild-to-moderate peripheral neuropathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HNPP is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and electrophysiologic findings and either the 1.5-Mb recurrent deletion or a novel deletion involving PMP22 (in 80%), or a PMP22 sequence variant (in 20%) identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and involves occupational therapy and physical therapy as needed to address issues with fine motor and gross motor skills, including activities of daily living. Bracing, such as with a wrist splint or ankle-foot orthosis, may be useful transiently or in some instances permanently. Special shoes, including those with good ankle support, may be needed. Neuropathic pain can be treated with analgesic medications. Protective pads at elbows or knees may prevent pressure and trauma to local nerves. Surveillance: Routine screening neurologic examination focused on muscle atrophy, strength, sensory loss, and neuropathic pain; physical and occupational therapy assessments of gross motor and fine motor skills and activities of daily living; foot examinations for pressure sores or poorly fitting footwear. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged sitting with legs crossed; prolonged leaning on elbows; occupations requiring repetitive movements of the wrist; rapid weight loss; vincristine. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Asymptomatic relatives at risk may wish to clarify their genetic status by undergoing molecular genetic testing for the PMP22 pathogenic variant identified in an affected family member in order to be advised about agents and circumstances to avoid. Genetic counseling HNPP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 20% of individuals with HNPP have the disorder as the result of a de novo PMP22 pathogenic variant. Each child of an affected individual is at a 50% risk of inheriting the PMP22 pathogenic variant. Once the PMP22 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by a lack of motor inhibition during REM sleep leading to potentially harmful dream-enacting behaviors. RBD affects mainly older men and its prevalence in the general population is estimated to be around 0.5%. RBD may be idiopathic or associated with other neurologic disorders. A strong association between RBD and alpha-synucleinopathies has been recently observed, with the parasomnia often heralding the clinical onset of the neurodegenerative disease. The idiopathic form accounts for up to 60% of the cases reported in the three largest series of patients with RBD. Small clinical follow-up studies revealed that a proportion of these patients will eventually develop a parkinsonian syndrome or a dementia of Lewy bodies type in the years following the RBD diagnosis, while some patients will never show other neurologic signs within several decades from the RBD onset. Recent studies have looked at neurophysiologic and neuropsychological functions in idiopathic RBD and have found evidences of CNS dysfunction during both wakefulness and sleep. An impairment of the cortical activity, specific neuropsychological deficits, and signs of autonomic dysfunction have been observed in a variable proportion of these patients, challenging the concept of idiopathic RBD. Identifying subjects with a high risk of developing a neurodegenerative process may be crucial in order to develop early intervention strategies.",

      "abstract": "Vertigo can be defined as an illusion or hallucination of movement. The control of balance is complicated. Vertigo can be caused by many different pathologies, some of which are potentially life threatening. An important differentiation is whether the symptoms of vertigo originate from a central or peripheral origin. Clues to a central origin are other brainstem symptoms or signs of acute onset such as headache, deafness and other neurological findings. These patients warrant urgent referral and investigation. Red flags in patients with vertigo include: headache; neurological symptoms; and neurological signs. It is useful to categorise vertigo into acute and chronic. The former usually has a single mechanism whereas chronic dizziness is often multifactorial. History is usually the most important part of the assessment. Key questions should be asked and it is vital to establish if the patient is suffering from vertigo or some other complaint such as anxiety or syncope. A neurological and otological examination should be performed, appropriate to the history. Assessment of gait and posture is crucial. If the patient has positional vertigo then a Hallpike test should be performed. Visual acuity should be checked as vision is a vital part of the balance system. The cranial nerves should be tested in particular eye movements for any ophthalmoplegia pointing to focal cranial nerve pathology and for nystagmus. The rest of the neurological examination should exclude evidence of central disease, in particular cerebellar disease, and neuropathy. If syncope is suspected it is wise to perform an extensive systemic examination in particular lying and standing BP, and cardiovascular and respiratory system assessments.",

This electroclinical condition may be appropriately named Markand-Blume-Ohtahara syndrome, after Markand and Blume, who initially described in detail the EEG pattern of multifocal spike discharges with its major clinical correlates, and Ohtahara, who extensively studied the group of patients with both clinical and EEG characteristics and proposed the concept of severe epilepsy with multiple independent spike foci, classifying it as one type of generalized epilepsy.",

It is known that children show special conditions in various subjects from their peers due to their physical, mental, social development and brain activities being affected. It is revealed that these special conditions affect peer relations in children's social lives, cognitive issues such as problem solving, analytical thinking, language development issues such as understanding and expression, as well as the child's balance and physical activity. By processing the information coming from visual, vestibular and proprioceptive systems together, the symptoms and characteristics of physical activities in body movements with the energy available by using the muscles in the balance and skeletal system are determined to a great extent. The characteristics of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, their assessment, the balance context and the level of physical activity are described.",

      "abstract": "Predominant abnormalities of cone photoreceptor function are present in retinal disorders previously classified under a number of headings, such as cone dystrophies, cone-rod degenerations, color blindness, complete and incomplete achromatopsia, some types of retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt disease, and many inherited systemic diseases with retinal degeneration. In this chapter we will try to clarify the classification of disorders that predominantly or primarily affect cones and either involve the eye alone or occur in the context of systemic diseases.The term “cone dysfunction syndromes” refers to disorders that are predominantly stationary while cone dystrophies and cone–rod degenerations involve progressive loss of cone function and generalized retinal degeneration with (in the latter) or without (in the former) subsequent signs and symptoms of rod dysfunction (Table 26.1).1 Stationary disorders include normal variations in color vision, anomalous trichromacy, dichromacy complete and incomplete achromatopsia, rod monochromacy, oligocone trichromacy, and bradyopsia. Although blue cone monochromacy was initially thought to be a stationary disorder, patients develop progressive macular degeneration and atrophy in middle and old age (Fig. 26.1).2 The stationary cone dysfunction syndromes (Table 26.2) are for the most part covered in chapter 36. A section on oligocone trichromacy and bradyopsia is included in this chapter.Cone dystrophies are characterized by the clinical triad of photodysphoria, abnormal color vision or dyschromatopsia, and reduced central vision, with or without nystagmus. Cone dystrophies overlap to some extent with cone–rod degenerations in which rod dysfunction is added to that of cones. One less well-defined group of cone disorders includes benign concentric annular dystrophy, cone dystrophy with supernormal ERG, and occult macular degeneration. We have classified them under the cone dystrophies since they show signs and symptoms of progressive cone dysfunction.Cone–rod degenerations are varied, and most or the genes that cause these autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked disorders have been identified (Table 26.3). Cone–rod degeneration also occurs in a number of systemic conditions, such as the Bardet-Biedl syndromes, fucosidosis, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, infantile phytanic acid storage disease, and methylmalonic aciduria with homocystinuria, among other rare inherited diseases.Finally, toxicity from some medications, such as digoxin and chloroquine, may result in macular degeneration and cone dysfunction. Toxic retinopathies are not discussed in this textbook.Many of the inherited disorders in Table 26.1 are covered in chapter 36 and the reader is referred to the respective chapters for more information.",

      "title": "Alteraciones cognitivas y emocionales en el insomnio crónico",
      "abstract": "Little is known about the cognitive and emotional alterations associated with chronic insomnia.After reviewing the aetiology and pathophysiology of chronic insomnia, taking into account the patient's vulnerability and its inheritability, this study reports on the knowledge currently held about the cognitive deficits and emotional alterations observed in patients with chronic insomnia.Most aetiological models include factors that predispose an individual to insomnia, as well as precipitating and maintaining it. Predisposing factors can be of a biological or psychosocial nature. One predisposing factor that plays an important role is the vulnerability to insomnia, which is related to a non-adaptive way of coping with stress (focused on the emotion rather than on the problem) and the internalisation of negative emotions, which favours a state of physiological, cognitive and emotional hyperactivation that disrupts sleep and may lead to insomnia. This vulnerability is largely hereditary. Two phenotypes, based on the objective duration of sleep, have been described, the difference between them being the severity of the disorder. Insomniacs with an objective sleep time below six hours present significant cognitive deficits. These become manifest in tasks that require a large number of cognitive resources, complex attention tasks, changes in the focus of attention, the process of consolidation of memory during sleep, and working memory. These data suggest the existence of a prefrontal dysfunction. Comorbidity between insomnia and anxiety-depression is high. The anxiety-depression triggered by the internalisation of emotions predisposes the individual to insomnia and this, in turn, intensifies the depression.Alteraciones cognitivas y emocionales en el insomnio cronico.Introduccion. Las alteraciones cognitivas y emocionales asociadas al insomnio cronico son poco conocidas. Desarrollo. Tras revisar la etiologia y fisiopatologia del insomnio cronico, considerando la vulnerabilidad a este y su heredabilidad, se describe el estado actual de conocimientos acerca de los deficits cognitivos y las alteraciones emocionales observados en el insomnio cronico. Conclusiones. La mayoria de los modelos etiologicos incluye factores que predisponen al insomnio, que lo precipitan y que lo mantienen. Los factores predisponentes pueden ser de tipo biologico o psicosocial. Un factor predisponente que desempeña un importante papel es la vulnerabilidad al insomnio, que se relaciona con un modo no adaptativo de afrontar el estres (centrado en la emocion en vez de en el problema) y la internalizacion de las emociones negativas, lo cual favorece un estado de hiperactivacion fisiologica, cognitiva y emocional que altera el sueño y puede desembocar en insomnio. Esta vulnerabilidad es en gran parte hereditaria. Se han descrito dos fenotipos, basados en la duracion objetiva del sueño, que difieren en la gravedad del trastorno. Los insomnes con duracion objetiva del sueño menor de seis horas presentan deficits cognitivos significativos. Estos se manifiestan en tareas que requieren gran cantidad de recursos cognitivos, tareas de atencion complejas, cambio de foco de atencion, proceso de consolidacion de la memoria durante el sueño y memoria operativa. Estos datos sugieren la existencia de una disfuncion prefrontal. Se da una alta comorbilidad entre insomnio y ansiedad-depresion. La ansiedad-depresion provocada por la internalizacion de las emociones predispone al insomnio, y este, a su vez, intensifica la depresion.",

      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders have been frequently reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, there is insufficient evidence to guide precise recommendations on some diagnostic and treatment strategies. Here, we review clinical studies dealing with sleep abnormalities in PD and present clinical recommendations. Previous studies describing insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, narcolepsy-like episodes, circadian changes, sleep-disordered breathing, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, vivid dreams and restless legs syndrome are evaluated. Longitudinal studies associating sleep disorders with PD onset or clinical deterioration are rare: only one longitudinal study associated daytime sleepiness with PD onset. Evidence suggests that clinical investigations must include direct questioning about depressive symptoms, nocturnal cramps, pain, nocturia and nighttime off periods. A patient interview must be conducted regarding sleep symptoms, including nightmares, abnormal behavior during sleep, snoring, restless legs syndrome and daytime sleepiness. Initial evidence indicates that light therapy improves motor function and depression. Advice on sleep hygiene, the treatment of concomitant depression and the careful use of dopaminergic drugs and hypnosedative agents should be considered. To date, very few controlled studies are available to make a recommendation for the management of sleep-wake disturbances in PD.",

      "title": "Brain correlates of apathy in Kleine Levin syndrome: a mean apparent propagator study",
      "abstract": "Synopsis Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by episodes of severe hypersomnia, apathy, cognitive impairment, derealization and behavioral disturbances. Between episodes, patients have normal sleep, mood and behavior. Apathy is a prominent clinical feature of KLS but its pathophysiology is not known. Here we used mean apparent propagator to investigate white matter changes in KLS and correlated diffusion changes with apathy scores. Results showed that the corpus callosum was involved in KLS during episodes and mean RTAP measures in the corpus callosum correlated with apathy scores. Results were in accordance with known motivation-based circuits involving the orbitomedial frontal cortex. Purpose Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare neurological disorder that mainly affects adolescents. KLS is characterized by relapsing-remitting episodes of severe hypersomnia, apathy, cognitive impairment, derealization and behavioral disturbances. Between episodes, patients have normal sleep, mood and behavior [1]. Each episode is of brief duration varying from a week to 1-2 months. No definite cause has been identified [1]. Anatomical MRI scan is normal, but brain scintigraphy can be abnormal during and between episodes [2]. Apathy is a prominent clinical feature of KLS [3] but its pathophysiology in the disease remains to be established. The mechanisms responsible for apathy may involve several circuits connecting the frontal lobes to the basal ganglia [4]. Here, we performed TBSS analyses on the return-to-the-axis probability (RTAP) measures that may be linked to apparent axonal diameter and inflammation [5] to analyze the integrity of white matter (WM) microstructure of healthy volunteers (HV) compared to symptomatic (KLS-S) and asymptomatic (KLS-AS) patients. Methods We prospectively included 20 KLS-AS (mean age: 22.2 ± 8.9 years, 9 males) and 20 HV age and sex-matched one by one. Twelve of these 20 patients were also scanned during episodes (KLS-S). Apathy was assessed using the Starkstein Apathy score [6]. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired using a Siemens Verio 3T with a 12-channel head coil (GRAPPA=2; TR/TE=7.7s/92ms; voxel size: 2.5mm isotropic; 64, 32 and 8 gradient directions for b-values of 1800, 700, and 300 s/mm² respectively) and 8 images without diffusion weighting were also acquired. We preprocessed the images using FSL (fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/) and included correction for susceptibility (topup) and for eddy current distortions (eddycor) and creation of a binary mask of the brain (bet). Then, we generated RTAP maps of all subjects [7]. Voxelwise statistical analyses were carried out using TBSS, part of the FSL comparing RTAP maps of HV versus KLS-AS, HV versus KLS-S and KLS-AS versus KLS-S (paired t-test). Finally, in the TBSS-based ROI, we computed correlations between clinical scores (disease duration and apathy scores) and mean RTAP measures in this ROI and performed tractography on one healthy subject to determine its projection fibers. Results were considered significant at p<0.05, fully corrected for multiple comparisons across space. Results There were no significant differences in RTAP between HV and KLS-AS. In KLS-S compared to KLS-AS, RTAP increased in the corpus callosum (CC). There was a correlation between apathy scores and mean RTAP in the CC of KLS-S (p=0.03, r=0.61) (see Figure 2). There were no other correlations with clinical scores in KLS-AS as well as in KLS-S. Using the TBSS-ROI as a seed for tractography, fibers passing through the CC with abnormal RTAP measures projected to medial orbitofrontal cortex (see Figure 3). Discussion and conclusion The results highlight the presence of structural changes correlated to the apathy score in the anterior portion of the CC during episodes, a region where fibers project onto the medial orbitofrontal cortex. As, these prefrontal regions are involved in motivation processes [4], this suggests that apathy in KLS could result from difficulties to provide the affective/motivational value of a given behavioral context.",

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Neuropsychiatric ManifestationsThe manifestations of neuropsychiatric illness in lupus erythematosus in order of decreasing frequency are (1) alterations of mental function including organic brain syndromes, affective illnesses, and schizophrenia-like disorders;(2) transient or recurrent seizures, usually generalized, although a variety of forms has been described; (3) paresis resulting from ischemia or hemorrhage; (4) tremor, choreoathetosis, or ataxia; (5) nuclear and infranuclear cranial neuropathies; and (6) peripheral neuropathies, usually of a mixed sensory-motor variety.Feinglass et al. 1 surveyed the relationships of nervous system involvement to other manifestations of the disease.Neuropsychiatric manifestations attributed to central nervous system SLE occurred in 37% of 140 patients, and five of these presented with neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.The most frequent manifestations were psychiatric dysfunction, seizures, long tract signs, cranial neuropathy, and peripheral neuropathy.Psychiatric abnormalities secondary to SLE were characterized by organic features and by associated neurological findings, often diffuse or multifocal.The spinal fluid was abnormal in only 32%, usually a modest elevation of protein (70 to 92 mg/dl) and/or pleocytosis.The EEG was abnormal in 71%, particularly in association with seizures or focal neurological signs.Frequently, central nervous system abnormalities were an early feature, and in 63% neuropsychiatric involvement either",

Neurological examination is a simple method to assess these symptoms. Neurological signs come in two varieties; they are either of the hard or the soft type. Hard symptoms appear primarily in organic psychiatric disorders or as side effects of psychiatric therapy. They can also be encountered during neurological diseases of psychiatric patients. Their use in diagnostics and therapy is widely accepted. In contrast, soft neurological symptoms often stay unnoticed, even though they may contain important pieces of information. For this reason they will form the focus of our discussion. Soft neurological symptoms have been studied in different psychiatric disorder-groups. Up to now most attention has been devoted to schizophrenia. The study suggests that the soft symptoms are trait markers of schizophrenia. Furthermore they also signal disease activity and predict the outcome of the disease. Neurological symptoms are also important pointers for psychiatry. However, more systematic studies may increase the theoretical and practical implications of soft symptoms.",

Visual images produced by the intrinsic components of the eyes are often normal and are known as entoptic phenomena. In contrast, the visual system may be disrupted by various disorders and pathologic processes, which can result in metamorphopsia, transient loss of vision, and positive scotomas. Such disruptions can be secondary to retinal and optic nerve disease, migraines associated with visual auras, and cerebrovascular and neurologic diseases; they can also be side effects of certain drugs. In addition, the visual system may process incoming sensory information in such a way that what is seen is perceived incorrectly, i.e. illusion; or the visual system may produce images of things not really there, i.e. hallucination. Various types of visual phenomena, disturbances, and hallucinations are discussed. The numerous visual presentations need to be differentiated so that appropriate treatment, management, and patient education can be rendered.",

      "abstract": "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), historically referred to as pseudoseizures or hysterical seizures, are sudden disturbances of motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, or emotional functions that can mimic epileptic seizures. PNES have a psychologic etiology related to dissociative disorders or conversion disorders, as opposed to the abnormally excessive neuronal activity found in epileptic seizures. Psychosocial conflicts are essentially converted into physical symptoms, resulting in seizure-like symptoms. This case report presents a 42-year-old male with a past history of child abuse, drug abuse, schizoaffective disorder, prior psychiatric hospitalizations, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was admitted to the behavioral health unit with recurrent seizure-like episodes. These episodes were witnessed in the ED, however, appropriate workup failed to confirm abnormal neural activity or evidence of any brain injury. The patient was admitted to the psychiatric service where he was monitored for additional epileptic activity using long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring (LT-VEEG). While subsequent clinical events that resembled epileptic seizures were observed, the LT-VEEG failed to identify any epileptic activity. A diagnosis of PNES was established and a decision was made for the patient to remain on his current antiepileptic, psychiatric, and diabetes medications during his hospitalization. He showed gradual improvement during his stay and confirmed an understanding of his diagnosis. He was released three days later with instructions for follow-up and continued treatment with his outpatient psychiatrist. Early therapeutic counseling in patients who have a differential diagnosis of PNES should be considered to help identify and address the underlying causes of the seizure activity in an effort to curtail these seizure-like events.",

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS Peripheral neuropathy can be the predominant or only manifestation of certain nutrient deficiencies. Cognitive difficulties or involvement of other parts of the central nervous system, such as the optic nerve and spinal cord, may accompany nutritional peripheral neuropathies. In most patients, the nutritional deficiency may have a single predominant cause, but in some cases, multiple causes may coexist. Obesity, for unclear reasons, can be associated with nutrient deficiencies. The rising rates of bariatric surgery and the incidence of nutrient deficiencies following bariatric surgery make this a particularly relevant topic for neurologists. ESSENTIAL POINTS Neuropathies caused by nutrient deficiencies are preventable with appropriate supplementation in high-risk situations. Early recognition and prompt treatment are essential to ensure an optimal outcome and minimize neurologic morbidity.",

      "title": "1001 A Case of Unusual Nocturnal Movements Consistent with Paroxysmal Hypnogenic Dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) is a rare subset of paroxysmal dyskinesias characterized by recurring involuntary dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that occur during sleep or immediately after an arousal from sleep. These episodes often occur without loss of consciousness or trigger and lack association with epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Report of case(s) A 61-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea compliant with PAP was referred for abnormal nighttime movements for the past 9 years. The episodes were characterized by stereotyped involuntary dystonic posturing involving his upper extremities or his entire body lasting up to 15 seconds. The onset of the events occurred invariable during nighttime sleep and resulted in awakenings from sleep. He denied dream enactment as well as other symptoms suggestive of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. Sleep deprived EEG demonstrated left temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness and captured a typical event that occurred during NREM stage II sleep and had no ictal correlate. An MRI of the brain was unremarkable. During overnight polysomnogram, his current PAP settings were found to be effective, and three episodes of body stiffening consistent with his typical events were captured. These episodes were found to occur after awakening from REM sleep and lasted less than 10 seconds each. There was no EEG correlate, and REM atonia was preserved throughout. The patient was started on oxcarbazepine for the nocturnal movements, which reduced the frequency of events from 12 to 4 events per night. Oxcarbazepine was tapered and discontinued due to side effects and incomplete control of the events. Genetic testing for epilepsy syndromes is pending. Conclusion PHD is a rare syndrome of involuntary movements which begin during sleep or cause awakenings from sleep and can be misdiagnosed as a sleep disorder. It is crucial for the sleep physician to be aware of possible neurological causes of sleep-related movement disorders. Furthermore, our patient’s partial response to oxcarbazepine may further support that PHD may have an epileptic origin although not well characterized.

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "abstract": "Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) is a congenital anomaly of the optic disc that might result in moderate to severe vision loss in children. With a vast number of cases now being reported, the rarity of ONH is obviously now refuted. The major aspects of ophthalmic evaluation of an infant with possible ONH are visual assessment, fundus examination, and visual electrophysiology. Characteristically, the disc is small, there is a peripapillary double-ring sign, vascular tortuosity, and thinning of the nerve fiber layer. A patient with ONH should be assessed for presence of neurologic, radiologic, and endocrine associations. There may be maternal associations like premature births, fetal alcohol syndrome, maternal diabetes. Systemic associations in the child include endocrine abnormalities, developmental delay, cerebral palsy, and seizures. Besides the hypoplastic optic nerve and chiasm, neuroimaging shows abnormalities in ventricles or white- or gray-matter development, septo-optic dysplasia, hydrocephalus, and corpus callosum abnormalities. There is a greater incidence of clinical neurologic abnormalities in patients with bilateral ONH (65%) than patients with unilateral ONH. We present a review on the available literature on the same to urge caution in our clinical practice when dealing with patients with ONH. Fundus photography, ocular coherence tomography, visual field testing, color vision evaluation, neuroimaging, endocrinology consultation with or without genetic testing are helpful in the diagnosis and management of ONH.

      "abstract": "Introduction. Prompt diagnosis of lower spinal diseases is essential for successful treatment. Appro­ priate medical therapy or surgical decompression ar­ rests progression and reverses existing neurologic deficit. Delayed or improper diagnosis seriously jeop­ ardizes the patient's ultimate neurologic status. Too often early symptoms are disregarded or passed over as insignificant. Diseases of the lower spinal region caused by congenital malformation, trauma, spondylosis, demy­ eli nation, and metastasis are readily recognized; however, there are a variety of additional disease processes which affect the lower spine and its con­ tents. These processes are either rapid and devas­ tating or elusive and slowly progressive. A keen sense of awareness on the part of the physician will aid the recognition of these disorders. In this regard eleven patients with uncommon disorders of the lower spinal region are presented. All had delayed or prob­ lematic diagnoses and were encountered directly or indirectly during the past seven years. Viewed collec­ tively these infrequently occurring disorders of the lower spine appear with some regularity . This re­ view shows that adherence to tenets of neurologic localization, deduction of pathologic processes, a nd use of available laboratory tests often lead to the correct diagnosis. The disease states presented are divided into five categories: metabolic, vascular, tumorous, infectious, and those du~ to physical agents. Some, but not all,",

Neurophysiological investigations are essential to diagnose NM and to distinguish it from other motor disorders, such as tremor or positive myoclonus.

      "title": "NEUROMUSCULAR COMPLICATIONS OF CRITICAL ILLNESS",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Neuromuscular weakness is common in the setting of critical illness. Over the past two decades, it has been recognized that polyneuropathy or myopathy may develop de novo as a complication of the underlying illness, sepsis, or the medical therapies. This weakness complicates recovery and often contributes to prolonged ventilator dependence. REVIEW SUMMARY The neuromuscular complications of critical illness include critical illness polyneuropathy, an acute myopathy, and prolonged pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade. As a complication of critical illness and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (usually produced by sepsis), an axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy may be seen. A myopathy, often called acute quadriplegic myopathy, may develop in a similar setting, often in association with the use of corticosteroids and/or nondepolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs). Weakness in this latter disorder may result from electrical inexcitability of muscle due to altered membrane sodium channels with reduced sodium currents and loss of myosin thick filament. Some patients, particularly those with abnormal renal or hepatic function, may have prolonged weakness for as long as one week after the use of NMBAs. This large, heterogeneous group of patients are difficult to evaluate due to the limitations imposed by the critical care setting and may have critical illness polyneuropathy, acute quadriplegic myopathy, or both. CONCLUSIONS Neuromuscular weakness may occur in association with a combination of risk factors, including sepsis and multiorgan failure (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), high-dose corticosteroids, and NMBAs. This may take the form of an axonal polyneuropathy, an acute myopathy, or both.",

      "abstract": "Sleep in dementias has been mainly studied in Alzheimer disease (AD). Sleep disturbances are found in 25 to 35% of subjects with AD. Subjective and objective disturbances are described. Long nocturnal awakenings disrupt sleep; total sleep time and sleep efficiency are reduced. Slow wave sleep is decreased and sometimes disappears. REM sleep percentage is also reduced and at a later stage of the disease, REM latency is increased. Sleep fragmentation can be associated with excessive daytime napping and sleepiness, and with other behavioral symptoms such as the sundowning syndrome and nocturnal agitation. Sleep abnormalities closely parallel the level of severity of dementia. The rest/activity ratio and the sleep-wake rhythms are more and more disturbed; the phase delay of the temperature rhythm is associated with the severity of the sundowning syndrome. Sleep disturbances and behavioral symptoms are the main reasons to institutionalize the patient. Sleep disturbances are related to multiple factors. Pathophysiological changes resulting of the disease itself, such as damage to the cholinergic pathways and to the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, contribute to sleep changes in AD. Associated medical and psychiatric illness and their different treatments as well as environmental factors also induced sleep disturbances. Sleep-disordered breathing is a highly prevalent condition in AD patients and restless leg syndrome may account for nocturnal agitation. In Parkinson and in Lewy body dementias, sleep disturbances are more severe than in DA and REM sleep behavior disorder can precede by several years these diseases. Sleep attacks and sleepiness are very frequent in Parkinson disease. Specific etiologies should drive specific treatment. Several non pharmacologic treatments are usually associated to treat sleep disturbances in AD: information, increased daytime physical, social activities to minimize daytime naps and exposure to bright light. Some studies found advantages to associate melatonin in the evening.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

These diseases may manifest at any age from birth until late adulthood with acute manifestation or as a chronic progressive disease. Virtually any organ may be impaired, but the organs with the highest energetic demands are most frequently involved, including brain, muscle, heart and liver. Some mitochondrial disorders affect a single organ (e.g., the eye in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy), but many involve multiple organ systems. Many patients display an assemblage of clinical features that can be ascribed to a discrete clinical syndrome, such as the Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), neurogenic weakness with ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), or mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). On the other hand, many other mitochondrial disorders do not clearly fit into one particular and recognizable syndrome category, and the spectrum of disease phenotypes can be broadly overlapping among several syndromes. All possible inheritance patterns can be found (maternal, X linked, autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and de novo occurrence) due to the dual involvement of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.",

      "abstract": "Lewy body dementia is a neurodegenerative disease of the elderly characterised by cognitive impairment coupled with mild parkinsonism, visual hallucinations and a fluctuating mental status. 1 Diagnosis is established by autopsy or brain biopsy findings of characteristic Lewy bodies within neurons.However, one can usually identify Lewy body dementia on clinical grounds alone. 1The management of Lewy body dementia in general is similar to Alzheimer's disease, with first-line treatment being cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine. 1It is currently unclear whether the second main medication for Alzheimer's disease, memantine, should also be used for Lewy body dementia.Memantine, a non-competitive inhibitor of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors, has proven benefits in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease especially when used in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor. 2A retrospective case study of 11 patients with Lewy body dementia found that 7 of the patients had improvement in cognition with memantine but 4 had clinical deterioration. 3 Two other papers describe the worsening of delusions and hallucinations in 4 Lewy body dementia patients. 4,5 Summarised here is a case report of a woman I saw in my practice, which serves to augment the currently meagre published data available about the effects of memantine in patients with Lewy body dementia.An 82-year-old woman living in a nursing home and diagnosed with mild Alzheimer's was started on donepezil.She began manifesting cogwheel rigidity, which was worse on the left side and intermittent pill-rolling tremors.An addition of levadopa/carbidopa 25/100, 1 tablet 3 times daily, relieved the rigidity and tremor, but caused significant nausea and orthostatic hypotension.Both medications were then discontinued and memantine was initiated as an alternative anti-dementia agent.The stiffness and tremor went away, but the patient began manifesting delusions, visual hallucinations and episodic confusion.At that point, a diagnosis of Lewy body dementia was made, which was later confirmed by a consultation with a neurologist.Memantine was discontinued; the hallucinations and delusions subsided almost completely, with only occasional visual hallucinations reported each month instead of a daily basis when she was at her worst.Delirium persisted, however, until the patient was restarted on donepezil, similar to other case reports. 6She has been stable over 6",

      "abstract": "The effect of sleep on the involuntary movements or dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, primary and secondary torsion dystonia, and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome was studied in a total of 52 patients and 10 normal subjects using video electroencephalographic telemetry. Movements typical of the wake pattern were seen occasionally during unequivocal sleep in all but two completed studies, and in each condition reappeared under similar circumstances. The movements were most likely to occur after awakenings or lightenings of sleep, or in stage one sleep. The movements were very rare during the deeper phases of sleep. Those movements that occurred during sleep without awakenings were usually preceded by arousal phenomena and, rarely, by sleep spindles or slow waves. The control group showed normal \"semipurposeful\" movements under the same conditions during sleep. The rare appearance of the different dyskinesias and normal movements under similar circumstances during sleep could be a result of common effects on the generator systems or changes in the excitability of the final common motor pathway.",

      "abstract": "Background: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a prevalent neurological condition that results in various physical, emotional, and cognitive impairments. The most common are visual impairments, which affect vision’s perceptual, motor, and sensory aspects. Objective: This paper analyzes the pathophysiology of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and its effects on visual and oculomotor functions, focusing on the deficits of the accommodative system and their underlying mechanism. Findings: mTBI frequently causes diffuse axonal injury, resulting in abnormalities of the neurometabolic cascade that impact the brain’s visual regions. Accommodative anomalies, including insufficiency, infacility, and spasm, are markedly more common in mTBI patients than in the general population. These deficiencies present as a notable delay in accommodation response, diminished peak velocity, and compromised dynamic responses, possibly due to sensory and motor disturbances. Conclusions: Accommodation disorder is a significant but under-examined component of visual sequelae related to mTBI. Future research should concentrate on the sensory and motor factors contributing to these deficiencies to enhance diagnostic precision and customize rehabilitative strategies.",

Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus is featured by myoclonic \"lightninglike\" jerks of the extremities that exclusively occur during sleep; it is not associated with epilepsy that occur only during sleep and cease abruptly when the child is agitated. This case reported was a 50 days-old baby boy with a history suggestive of abnormal movements for limbs noted over the preceding 7 days. Diagnosis of BNSM in infant based on history taking, clinical manifestation, and with no electroencephalographic changes. BNSM is usually not associated with any other neurologic impairment and spontaneously subsides within the first year of life. Its importance lies in the differential diagnosis with the epileptic, especially myoclonic, seizures of infancy. BNSM can be misinterpreting for neonatal seizures or even neonatal status epilepticus, the recognition of benign sleep myoclonus of infancy is imperative to elude unnecessary diagnostic studies and treatments.",

      "abstract": "Objectives Dystonia-plus and paroxysmal dyskinetic disorders are hyperkinetic movement disorders with dystonia as the predominant component. Identification of disease causing genes for these disorders has allowed examination of genetically homogenous groups. Unlike the motor symptoms, non-motor characteristics are less clearly defined. This review examines the literature pertaining to non-motor symptoms to date and identifies areas of future research. Methods A systematic search strategy was used to review published literature relating to psychiatric disorders, cognition and sleep disturbance in genetically defined dystonia-plus and paroxysmal dyskinetic disorders. Results Fifty-two articles were identified, the majority involving dystonia-plus disorders (n=42). Psychiatric symptoms were the most clearly defined with anxiety, depression and Obsessive-Compulsive disorder being most prominent. Cognitive impairment involved either global deficits or isolated involvement of specific domains. Sleep disturbance was documented in few disorders, being most common in the dopa-responsive dystonias. Conclusions Results to date suggest that non-motor features form an integral component of the dystonia-plus and paroxysmal dyskinetic phenotype, with disruption to monoaminergic metabolism likely to play a central role. Further systematic and standardised assessment of these genetically homogenous cohorts is required to identify specific phenotypic characteristics. This will improve patient treatment, quality of life and our understanding of underlying pathogenesis.",

      "title": "Depression, sleep, and antidepressants.",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are an integral feature of depressive disorders. Like the disorders themselves, the sleep disturbances associated with depression are heterogeneous, ranging from hypersomnia to marked difficulties maintaining sleep. These difficulties are to some extent age dependent and reflect abnormalities of central nervous system arousal. Moreover, the sleep disturbances associated with depression have both reversible, or state-dependent, and more persistent trait-like characteristics. Polysomnographic recordings can be used to document sleep maintenance difficulties, and they often also reveal reduced slow wave sleep, an early onset of the first episode of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and increased phasic REM sleep. A deficit of serotonergic neurotransmission, a relative increase in pontine cholinergic activity, and, perhaps, an excess of noradrenergic and corticotropin-releasing hormone activity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the sleep disturbances of more severe depressive disorders. Antidepressant medications have class- and compound-specific effects on polysomnographic profiles. Unlike other antidepressants, bupropion may increase or intensify REM sleep. While no single effect of antidepressants on sleep neurophysiology is necessary or sufficient for treatment efficacy, differences in drug effects may provide important clues to selection of specific medications for particular patients.",

      "title": "Polyneuropathy in Young Siberian Huskies Caused by Degenerative and Inflammatory Diseases",
      "abstract": "Polyneuropathy is defined as the simultaneous dysfunction of several peripheral nerves. In dogs, a number of breeds are predisposed to a variety of immune-mediated and/or degenerative inherited forms of polyneuropathy, with laryngeal paralysis and/or megaesophagus as important clinical features of many of these conditions. This case series describes degenerative and inflammatory polyneuropathies in 7 young Siberian huskies that were categorized based on clinicopathological characteristics as follows: (1) slowly progressive laryngeal paralysis and megaesophagus caused by primary axonal degeneration with large fiber loss (n = 2); (2) slowly progressive polyneuropathy without megaesophagus or laryngeal paralysis caused by primary axonal degeneration with large fiber loss (n = 2); (3) acute inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy causing sensory, motor and autonomic nerve deficits (n = 2); and (4) ganglioradiculitis (sensory neuronopathy; n = 1). Based on the predominantly young age at onset, slow progression, relatedness of affected dogs, and clinical and pathological similarities with inherited neuropathies reported in other dog breeds, a hereditary basis for the degenerative polyneuropathies in Siberian huskies is suspected. However, 5 different mutations in 3 genes known to cause polyneuropathy in other dog breeds (NDRG1, ARHGEF10, or RAB3GAP1) were not detected in the affected Siberian huskies suggesting that more genetic variants remain to be identified. This study highlights the varied underlying lesions of polyneuropathies in young Siberian huskies.",

MethodsThe clinical features of the case including clinical manifestations, serial electroencephalography (EEG) outcomes, neuroimaging findings, neuropsychological outcomes, interventional approaches and long-term follow-up outcomes, were analyzed. ResultsThis previously normal girl (3y10m), presented with progressive ataxia as an onset symptom, ensued with cognitive impairments and language regressions (characterized by verbal auditory agnosia and expressive aphasia), and autistic-like behaviors.She had no evidence of clinical seizures, with normal brain and spine MRI scans, intact auditory exams and normal brain auditory evoked potential, although the sleep-activated inter-ictal epileptiform discharges of EEG were revealed.The patient showed gradual resolution of symptoms with long-term high-dose steroids plus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) regimens, in consistence with the gradual improvement of the outcomes of serial EEGs.She recovered and returned to normal kindergarten 1y1m after the onset of the disease, consistent with the normal EEG results.Her full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) was 71 score, with verbal IQ 66 and performance IQ 81 respectively, tested at the time of 1y3m after the onset.The long-term prognosis of the case was good as she had good academic performance and was a monitor of the class at the time of her long-term follow-up of 5y8m after the onset.

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer disease (ad). Its heterogeneous presentation and overlapping features with other dementias result in frequent misdiagnosis, which can delay optimal management. The present case illustrates complex symptomology, comprehensive assessment, and diagnostic challenges in a patient with DLB. Method A 64-year-old female presented to an academic medical center neurology clinic with rapid cognitive deterioration over the past 1.5 years accompanied by visual disturbances, psychiatric and behavioral changes, and mild motor symptoms. Initial differential included Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, atypical parkinsonism, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), encephalopathy, and ad. Work-up in included neuropsychological, neuroimaging, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), electroencephalogram (EEG), and skin biopsy assessments. Results Neuropsychological interview revealed fluctuating attention/alertness, visual hallucinations, hyposmia, paranoid and repetitive behaviors, and subtle evidence for dream enactment. Her cognitive profile showed global impairment with pronounced visuospatial and executive deficits. Recognition memory, verbal reasoning, and naming were relatively well-preserved. Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild atrophy; fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) showed hypometabolism in frontal and temporal regions whereas uptake was highest in the occipital lobes and basal ganglia; skin biopsy was positive for synucleinopathy; CSF and EEG were broadly unrevealing. Conclusions The preponderance of data was consistent with diagnostic criteria for probable DLB. Skin biopsy increased diagnostic confidence. Atypical features included relatively rapid cognitive decline, minimal parkinsonism, and PET imaging suggesting FTLD. The present case highlights the utility of a multidisciplinary approach (e.g., neurological exam, detailed symptom screening, neuropsychological testing, and advanced laboratory assessments) in a complex case of DLB.",

La prevalen-cia puntual de la demencia asociada a la enfermedad se estima en alrededor del 25-30 °% con un incremento proporcional en relación con la edad y el tiempo de evolución de la enfermedad. El perfil clínico puede ser heterogéneo y hace referencia a la alteración en los diferentes dominios que supone un substrato neurobiológico diferente. La disfunción ejecutiva suele ser más frecuente en etapas tempranas de la enfermedad, aunque también hay perfiles clínicos corticales. Hay síntomas neuropsiquiátricos como la depresión, la ansiedad y el discontrol de impulsos que pueden afectar la cognición. La valoración rutinaria de las actividades de la vida diaria y el desempeño funcional se ha relacionado con el grado de compromiso así como con el rendimiento cognitivo global. Pacientes en estadios avanzados y candidatos a la cirugía de estimulación cerebral profunda requieren la evaluación neuropsicológica para seguimiento e identificación de potenciales riesgos o contraindicaciones cognitivas, comportamentales y/o emocionales. Las conclusiones del consenso de cognición son: 1) el deterioro cognitivo mínimo es común en los pacientes, incluso en estadios tempranos; 2) el perfil clínico es heterogéneo, aunque la disfunción ejecutiva es más frecuente; 3) la valoración inicial permite detectar perfiles de riesgo a demencia; 4) deben usarse instrumentos validados para esta población; 5) los síntomas neuropsiquiátricos pueden afectar el desempeño del paciente, y 6) la valoración de la independencia funcional permite explorar el impacto de la cognición en la cotidianidad.",

      "abstract": "As acute liver failure (ALF) and chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) continue to increase in prevalence, we will see more cases of hepatic encephalopathy. Primary care physician are often the first to suspect it, since they are familiar with the patient's usual physical and mental status. This serious complication typically occurs in patients with severe comorbidities and needs multidisciplinary evaluation and care. Hepatic encephalopathy should be considered in any patient with acute liver failure and cirrhosis who presents with neuropsychiatric manifestations, decrease level of consciousness (coma), change of personality, intellectual and behavioral deterioration, speech and motor dysfunction. Every cirrhotic patient may be at risk; potential precipitating factors should be addressed in regular clinic visits. The encephalopathy of liver disease may be prominent, or can be present in subtle forms, such as decline of school performance, emotional outbursts, or depression. \"Subtle form\" of hepatic encephalopathy may not be obvious on clinical examination, but can be detected by neurophysiologic and neuropsychiatric testing.",

Causation of the mental symptoms in certain cases is outlined, schematically, as a complex system of vicious circles, in which the two factors of anxiety and metabolic imbalance both play a part. 4. In view of our personal good results in such cases, a high-vitamin diet is recommended for tentative trial not only in acute or subacute psychoses characterized by delirium and amentia, but also in acute episodes of the organic-reaction type which occur in the course of schizophrenic and manic-depressive psychosis.",

Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is the most precisely defined neuromuscular complication in this context. It is characterized by a primary axonal degeneration of the motor and sensory nerve fibers with degeneration of the skeletal muscles as a result of their denervation. The precise etiology of CIP remains elusive. Electrophysiology must be used to confirm the diagnosis of CIP because clinical evaluation is clearly insufficient and testing can also exclude other entities such as a Guillain-Barré syndrome or a primary disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Nerve biopsy studies are not required for a diagnosis of CIP. Other disorders can explain neurophysiological abnormalities in critically ill patients after the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, such as persistent neuromuscular junction blockade, pure axonal neuropathy, and necrotizing myopathy. The incidence of myopathies in critically ill patients is not well characterized, although the incidence most likely is high in critically ill patients with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). The clinical picture of a primary myopathy is indistinguishable from other ICU-acquired causes of neuromuscular disease. Three main forms of myopathies in the ICU have been described: critical illness myopathy, thick filament myopathy, and necrotizing myopathy. Myopathies are difficult to detect because the neurophysiological studies are neither sensitive nor specific and a muscle biopsy is required.",

      "title": "Advances in MR Imaging of Leukodystrophies",
      "abstract": "Leukodystrophies are hereditary disorders of white matter that impair brain that is initially normally formed and developed (1, 2). They can affect brain myelin throughout life. The disorders are commonly progressive in nature and ultimately fatal. First manifestations are often cognitive deterioration and neuropsychological problems. Motor and balance difficulties occur, as do visual abnormalities. Classic leukodystrophies lead to a vegetative state or death within months to years. In general, the earlier the onset of symptoms, the more progressive the disease course. Most leukodystrophies are monogenetic disorders. The mutant gene often encodes an enzyme or protein that maintains neuronal and/or glial health and is responsible for regulation of brain metabolism. Many enzymes involved play a role in lipid metabolism. The inability to degrade or synthesize substrate leads to an upstream excess or downstream lack of vital lipids. This can cause a wide range of pathology, from inflammatory demyelination to axonal degeneration and microglial activation. Hence, the often cited prominent demyelination is only one manifestation in leukodystrophies, and myelinforming oligodendrocytes are not the only cells affected in these disorders. Yet, there are some common characteristics that distinguish the pathology in leukodystrophies from that of other disorders. MRI has played a seminal role in visualization of the lesion pattern. (3). The demyelinating lesions are usually confluent and symmetric. Many of the classic disorders, such as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and Krabbe, show relative sparing of subcortical fibers. Yet again, other disorders have early involvement of the U fibers and other unique characteristics, such as cystic rarefaction and degeneration. Hereditary disorders that do not show demyelination but rather hypomyelination have come to increasing attention (4). Common neurological features in hypomyelinating disorders are developmental delay, nystagmus, cerebellar ataxia and spasticity. One of the better characterized hypomyelinating disorders is Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease (PMD). Beyond this classic disorder, a multitude of other hypomyelinating disorders exist. Only about half of the patients with evidence of hypomyelination on MRI come to a definitive diagnosis. Yet, specific clinical and MRI features can be pathognomonic and lead to diagnosis.",

      "title": "Significance of REM Sleep in Depression: Effects on Neurogenesis",
      "abstract": "Disturbances of sleep are typical of depression and are observed in between 50% and 90% of depressed subjects [1]. Most patients with depression complain of insomnia and have well-described sleep disruptions, which belong to the core symptoms of the disorder [2]. Sleep disorders in depression have stimulated many sleep studies and for many decades sleep research has been a major pillar of neurobiological investigations into depression’s cause, onset and course. Since 1960s polysomnographic sleep research has demonstrated that besides disturbances of sleep continuity a constellation of sleep EEG changes is present in depression [3,4]. Especially Rapid Eye Movement activity has been the favorite focus of sleep EEG studies in depression and studies on its significance indicate that a strong link exists between dysregulation of REM sleep, REM latency, REM density, and the cause, onset and course of major depressive disorders. These alterations might act as trait dependent marker of depression and have been considered biological marker for depression. Especially shortened REM sleep Latency might be both a prodrome of major depressive episodes [2] and a consequence or complication of depression [2,5]. In fact REM alterations often persist beyond the clinical episode indicating heightened vulnerability to depressive relapse or recurrence, negative affecting treatment response independent of treatment method [2,6]. Moreover because the majority of antidepressant irrespective of their chemical class suppress REM sleep, it has been hypothesized that REM sleep suppression might be considered a key mechanism underlying treatment response and might be considered necessary if an antidepressant effect is obtained. Recently REM deregulations have been described to have a role in the production of the core symptoms of mood disorder contributing to the core features of cognitive distortion including self-worth [7] and to negative emotional memories consolidation. Studies have in fact demonstrated that there is a failure of sleep dependent emotional brain processing in REM sleep in depression which seems to support the development of clinical depression [8]. In addition, REM sleep is physiologically abnormal in persons at risk for depression. In fact several high risk studies including healthy relatives of patients with depression have demonstrated that REM sleep, particularly REM density changes, are present before the disorder’s onset and predict its development.Several theoretical models have been developed to explain REM sleep abnormalities in depression and they might be implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. Indeed Circardian Rhytm abnormalities have been hypothesized to explain REM sleep abnormalities in depression i.e. the Two Process Model, “S-deficiency” [9] the “Phase-advance” hypothesis [10], genetically driven [11] and the “hypocretine deficit hypothesis” [12], REM sleep dysregualtion have been historically posed as a causal process of depression [13]. In fact the “Monoamine Hypothesis,”ACh-hypersensitivity” in depression indicate a key role of REM sleep dysregualtions as specific features of this disorder due to cholinergic hyperactivity [14] which might be under genetic control. More recently REM sleep dysregulation have been hypothesized to contribute to neurometabolic alterations in depression. Recently McNamara et al. [7] suggest that one proximate mechanism that does directly yield the pathophysiologic pattern of hyperactive paralimbic/ ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC) and hypoactive dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dPFC) in mood disorders might be “REM hyperactivation or dis-inhibition” driven. A key role of REM sleep alterations in the pathogenesis of depression have been also indicated within the defect of brain maturation hypothesis. A novel concept for the etiology of depression proposes that a dysfunction of neural plasticity might represent a final common pathway underlying the biological and clinical characteristics of the disorder. Changes in neurogenesis might be linked to the pathophysiology of depression. In fact a decrease in neurogenesis has been shown in animal models of depression, and shift in brain plasticity might be stress related [15]. Recently it has been hypothesized that one mechanism that does directly yield the pathophysiologic pattern in mood disorders affecting neurogenesis is stress-related REM hyperactivation or dis-inhibition [16,17]. Moreover available data favor the hypothesis that the increase of stress hormones, due to sleep loss of depression and REM-stress related affects adult neurogenesis and it may endanger hippocampal integrity [18], thereby leading to cognitive dysfunction and contributing to the development of mood disorders (allostatic load) [16,17]. REM sleep changes in depression might be under a genetic control and are mediated by complex neurobiological modifications that involves noradrenergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic systems and the stress system which might affect adult neurogenesis and brain plasticity. Recently REM sleep alterations have been considered not only biological scars but true endophenotypes for depression [4,19]. In fact in the search of new “vulnerability markers” or “endophenotypes” for depression changes during the REM sleep period have been reconsidered of potential interest.Concluding form historical studies to more recent ones we might hypothesized that REM sleep might play an important key role in depression onset, course, cognitive emotional symptoms, expression and treatment response. Moreover REM sleep dysregulation might contribute to neurometabolic alterations in depression and are involved in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders. Especially it seems that REM sleep changes in depression might be under a genetic control and are mediated by host of genetic, neurochemical and neurobiological factors which might affect neurogenesis and brain plasticity of depressed patients. For all these evidences in the search of new “endophenotypes” changes during the REM sleep period have been reconsidered of potential interest. Clearly REM sleep dramatically modulates physiological, emotional and cognitive states of the human",

This condition is characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy), vision loss, problems with balance and coordination (cerebellar ataxia), and a decline in intellectual function. Seizures in CLN11 disease often involve a loss of consciousness, muscle stiffness (rigidity), and generalized convulsions (tonic-clonic seizures). Vision loss is gradual over time and is due to a condition called retinitis pigmentosa, which is caused by the breakdown of the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye (retina). People with CLN11 disease can also develop clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts) and rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus). Affected individuals can also develop muscle twitches (myoclonus), walking problems and falling (gait disturbance), and impaired speech (dysarthria). Over time, people with CLN11 disease develop short-term memory loss and loss of executive function, which is the ability to plan and implement problem-solving strategies and actions. They may also become irritable and impulsive. Some affected individuals experience visual hallucinations involving people or animals. CLN11 disease is one of a group of disorders known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). All of these disorders affect the nervous system and typically cause progressive problems with vision, movement, and thinking ability. The different NCLs are distinguished by their genetic cause. Each disease type is given the designation \"CLN,\" meaning ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal, and then a number to indicate its subtype.",

      "title": "The Neuropsychiatric Consequences of Childhood Encephalitis: A Review of Cases from Middle-Eastern Countries",
      "abstract": "Encephalitis is an acute inflammation of the brain which can arise after infections such as septicemia or by primary extension of the inflammation in cases of cerebral abscess or meningitis. In a more restricted sense, it refers to a primary disease in which inflammation of the brain is caused by viral agents. Especially in children it may also arise via autoimmune or hypersensitivity reactions. Although, laboratory processes have sufficiently developed to isolate and demonstrate offending agents in most of the cases, a number of sporadic cases remain in which a viral etiology is suspected on account of general presentation. The symptoms of encephalitis include headache, fever, drowsiness tremors, vomiting and photophobia along with those arising from involvement of the central nervous system (Lishman, 2003; Maria & Bale JR, 2006). The principal feature of cerebral involvement is disturbance of consciousness. Delirium may figure prominently in some varieties. Seizures are common especially in children and can be the presenting feature. Focal neurological signs depend on the site of inflammation and may vary. Changes in pupils and in deep tendon reflexes, ocular palsies, nystagmus, ataxia, pathological reflexes, and paresis of limbs are common. Dysphasia may denote involvement of the temporal lobe while urinary retention or paraparesis may reveal involvement of the spinal cord. Occasional cases may present with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations, psychosis, changes in personality, dementia, delirium, delusions, affective changes, paraphilias, amnesia and parkinsonism. Those attracted attention in early epidemics of encephalitis lethargica and examples may still occur with other varieties (Lishman, 2003; Maria and Bale JR, 2006). Although encephalitis may be an important cause of delirium and dementia as well as other psychopathology in childhood, those diagnoses present a diagnostic challenge to most child and adolescent psychiatrists leading to missed diagnoses (Cepeda, 2000; Jha, 2004; Nunn, Williams & Ouvrier, 2002, Schieveld et al., 2007). Also, encephalitis may be associated with significant childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide, however not much is known about the contemporary epidemiology and outcome (Galanakis et al., 2009).",

Our approach to the epilepsies in childhood has been clarified by the broad separation into benign and malignant syndromes. The factors that suggest a poorer outcome in terms of seizures, cognition, and behaviour include the presence of multiple seizure types, an additional, particularly cognitive disability, the presence of identifiable cerebral pathology, a high rate of seizures, an early age of onset, poor response to antiepileptic drugs, and the occurrence of CSE.1 \n\nConvulsive status epilepticus is not a syndrome in the same sense as febrile convulsions, benign rolandic epilepsy, and infantile polymorphic epilepsy. These latter disorders have a tight age frame, seizure semiology, and a reasonably predictable outcome. Episodes of CSE can occur in each: occasionally in febrile convulsions, rarely in benign rolandic epilepsy, and often in infantile polymorphic epilepsy. The issue of whether episodes of status epilepticus are intrinsically more dangerous in the malignant syndromes needs consideration before we accept global figures for CSE outcome, and we need to separate the immediate outcome of CSE from the eventual outcome, which may be heavily influenced by the context or syndrome in which it occurs.\n\nIn practical management we are likely to want to stop prolonged seizures as soon as possible, but in theoretical terms it may be important to know if some causes of CSE are intrinsically more dangerous. The paediatric dimension to CSE is therefore of many different causes and occurring in a patient who is less likely to have concomitant cardiovascular or respiratory disease. The hazards and outcome might be different.

      "title": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders for mental health professionals - a brief review",
      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "title": "Core symptoms of major depressive disorder: relevance to diagnosis and treatment",
      "abstract": "The construct of major depressive disorder makes no etiological assumptions about populations with diverse symptom clusters. “Depressed mood” and “loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities” are core features of a major depressive episode, though a strong case can be made to pay increasing attention to symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and neurocognitive and sexual dysfunction in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatment outcome. Mood, guilt, work, and interest, as well as psychic anxiety, are consistently identified across validated subscales of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as prevalent and sensitive to change with existing treatments. A major limitation of these antidepressant therapies is their narrow spectrum of action. While the core “mood and interest” symptoms have been the main focus of attention, the associated symptoms listed above are often unaffected or exacerbated by current treatments. Careful clinical evaluation should address all of these dimensions, recognizing that improvement may occur sooner in some symptoms (eg, mood) compared with others (eg, sleep disturbance).",

Some investigators tried to define \"awakenings\" behaviorally by analyzing continuous video recordings. Periodic limb movement disorder, originally described by Symonds as \"nocturnal myoclonus\", was questioned as being an epileptic equivalent. Restless legs syndrome is a dysesthesia that presents an important circadian relationship. Objective evaluations of the consequences of the sleep fragmentation are few in number. Most of them have been performed through studies of sleep-disordered breathing syndromes: upper airway resistance syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Insomnias are a cause of sleep deprivation. Menopause is also associated with sleep disruption. Often the reaction to this component will lead to a worsening of abnormal sleep, impacting on sleep hygiene, circadian timing of sleep-wake, and/or conditioning against sleep.",

      "title": "An observational study of ocular motor nerve palsies in diabetes mellitus.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION & HISTORY: A perfect alignment between the motor system of two eyes is responsible for viewing an object as single. The extraocular muscles of\r\nboth eyes work in co-ordination. When any one or more of these falter,\r\nit may manifest as double vision, drooping of eyelids, deviation of eyes\r\nor some times with pain. Patients may present to the ophthalmologist for\r\none of these complaints, may be referred by another physician or be\r\nseen accidently while they come for a routine check up. This may be one\r\nof the first manifestation of a multisystem disease like diabetes mellitus.\r\n\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n1. To study the ocular motor nerve palsy pattern due to Diabetes\r\nMellitus\r\n2. To study the relationship of glycaemic control in ocular motor\r\nnerve palsies.\r\n3. To study the association of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy\r\nin case of ocular motor nerve palsies.\r\n4. To study the recovery pattern.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nThe cases studied, included those patients with neurogenic ocular\r\nmotor nerve palsies who presented to the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology\r\nand Govt. Ophthalmic Hospital. All age groups and both sexes\r\nwere included.\r\nA complete ophthalmological workup was done.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\n1. The diabetic ocular motor nerve palsies occur in a wide range of\r\nage but are more common in the age group of 51 - 60 years.\r\n2. Overall males were affected more than females except in third\r\nnerve palsy which showed a slight female preponderance.\r\n3. Left eye involvement was common but was of no significance.\r\n4. Sixth nerve palsy was more common than third nerve palsy.\r\n5. Fourth nerve involvement in diabetes mellitus is comparatively\r\nrare & no patients were detected with IV nerve palsy.\r\n6. There was no significant correlation between the level of\r\nglycaemic control and incidence of ocular motor nerve palsy\r\nthough retinopathy and nephropathy were seen to occur more with\r\npoorer glycaemic status.\r\n7. More than three fourth of the patients had complete or partial\r\nrecovery.\r\n8. A careful history, general and complete ophthalmological workup\r\nwith necessary basic investigations is enough to diagnose patients\r\nwith diabetic ocular motor nerve palsies. Further evaluation and\r\nspecialist opinion are necessary when there is deviation from the\r\nnormal pattern of recovery.",

      "title": "Simple Partial Seizure",
      "abstract": "A seizure is a symptom that refers to episodic, excessive, and disorderly neuronal activity in the brain. Traditionally seizures have been classified into and generalized. Partial seizure refers to abnormal neural activity localized to one area of the cerebral hemisphere and having a discernible or localized onset. When there is no associated impairment in consciousness, it is called a simple seizure, and when it is associated with impairment in consciousness, it is called a complex seizure. When a seizure becomes generalized, it is referred to as a partial seizure with secondary generalization. New terminology for a simple seizure is focal onset aware seizure.Partial seizures are the most common type of seizures in patients with epilepsy. Complex seizures occur more often than simple seizures, although most complex seizures start as simple seizures.Patients with simple seizures remain awake and aware throughout the seizure, and some patients can even talk during the episode. It may be difficult to distinguish them from complex seizures in infants and patients with cognitive and speech difficulties, as impairment in consciousness can be difficult to assess in these patients.The term aura refers to signs and symptoms that occur with a seizure before consciousness is lost and for which memory is intact afterward. Auras that are not followed by seizure should be considered aware seizures or simple seizures.Depending on clinical signs, symptoms, and EEG localization, seizures can be further subdivided into four types: Focal motor seizures Focal sensory seizures Autonomic seizures Psychological seizures Focal Motor Seizures The or motor seizure occurs due to an epileptogenic lesion on the contralateral frontal lobe. Motor symptoms constitute the primary clinical manifestation. Typically, consciousness is not impaired in seizures of discrete motor areas. They usually originate from the supplementary motor area and cause turning movements of the head and neck to the opposite side and sometimes tonic contractions of the limbs and trunk on the same side. This may or may not be followed by generalized clonic movements. Subdivisions of ictal motor symptoms include elementary (tonic, clonic, dystonic, versive) and automatism (coordinated, repetitive motor activity like lip-smacking, tapping, and swallowing). Another classification based on clinical symptomatology uses the terms like clonic, tonic, or versive seizures.Focal motor seizures are more common on the face, hands, and toes because these areas have disproportionately large cortical representations. The excitatory focus is usually around the rolandic (motor) cortex. If there are accompanying sensory symptoms, the focus may be on post-rolandic convolution. Temporal lobe origin seizures sometimes have head-turning movements on the same side followed by the forceful contraversive turning of the head and body. Clonic seizures refer to repeated, short contractions of various muscle groups characterized by twitching movements or rhythmic jerking that recur at regular intervals of less than 1 to 2 seconds. These seizures are brief, lasting less than one to two minutes. In clonic seizures, there is epileptic activation of a restricted area of the precentral gyrus. Tonic seizures refer to sustained contractions that last for more than 5 to 10 seconds and result in the posturing of the limbs and whole body. Focal tonic seizures refer to tonic contractions restricted to a part of the body on one side. Focal tonic seizures are attributed to activation of Brodmann area 6, particularly the mesial frontal region. There may be some involvement of the premotor areas in some cases. Versive seizures consist of sustained, forceful, involuntary turning of head and eyes to one side due to tonic contraction of head and eye muscles. Usually, they are accompanied by loss of consciousness, but occasionally patients may be aware of the forced involuntary eye and head-turning. The version can result from seizures originating from various locations and spreading to the premotor cortex. Following convulsions with predominant motor symptoms, patients may have transient, functional, and localized paralysis of the affected limbs. This is known as Todd paralysis and can last minutes to hours, usually in proportion to the duration of the convulsion. This postepileptic paralysis occurs due to persistent dysfunction of the affected epileptogenic area and is the signature of a seizure. It has significant clinical value in lateralizing the hemisphere of seizure onset. Jacksonian March Seizure Jacksonian march seizure starts with tonic contractions in one hand or on one side of the face or the muscles of one foot. This is followed by clonic movements in these parts and sometimes a series of clonic movements with increasing frequency that builds up to a tonic contraction. These movements may spread (march) from the muscles affected to the other muscles on the same side of the body. In classic Jacksonian march, the seizure spreads from hand to arm to face and then down the leg ipsilaterally, or if it started in the foot, then seizure marches up the leg, down the arm, and then to the face. This typically happens over a short time (20 to 30 seconds). There can be other associated symptoms like automatism (lip smacking or tapping movements), hallucinations, muscle cramping, head-turning, etc. Symptoms are usually mild. These seizures rarely become generalized, and typically consciousness remains intact. Jacksonian march seizure can be mistaken for a transient ischemic attack, migraine, or other condition. Focal Somatosensory Seizures Sensory seizures present as numbness, tingling, crawling sensation, pins and needles feeling, and rarely, as pain or thermal sensations. They can be or can march to other ipsilateral body parts and usually have a focus in or around post-rolandic convolution of the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. Visual seizures are rare but have localizing significance. Visual hallucinations and visual loss are typical of occipital lobe epilepsy but sometimes can occur with seizure foci in anteromedial temporal and occipitotemporal regions. Auditory hallucinations are a rare initial manifestation of seizure and have sometimes been noted with lesions in the posterior temporal lobe on one side. Olfactory hallucinations often occur with a lesion in the inferior and medial parts of the temporal lobe. Gustatory hallucinations can occur in temporal lobe disease with lesions in the insula and parietal operculum. Autonomic Seizures Autonomic seizures manifest with predominantly altered autonomic function. Some common autonomic signs and symptoms include diaphoresis, shivering, piloerection, a rising sensation in epigastrium, nausea, changes in blood pressure and heart rate (commonly tachycardia), and pupillary changes. Autonomic features are common in several nonepileptic conditions, making autonomic seizures harder to diagnose.Some specific epilepsy syndromes with prominent autonomic features include neonatal seizures, epilepsy of infancy with migrating seizures, Dravet syndrome, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and early-onset benign occipital epilepsy. Psychological Seizures Psychological seizures manifest with affective and cognitive symptoms like memory flashbacks, dream-like events, Deja Vu feeling, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, and uncontrolled laughter or crying. They arise commonly from the temporal area rather than the extratemporal.",

      "title": "Different abnormalities of electroencephalographic (EEG) markers in quiet wakefulness are related to motor visual hallucinations in patients with Parkinson’s and Lewy body diseases",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second‐most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects 2–3% of the population ≥ 65 years of age and may belong to cognitive deficits and dementia in 50% of cases. Disease with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is emerging as another important cause of dementia in pathological aging. PD and DLB are both due to intra‐neuronal Lewy bodies and are characterized not only by motor dysfunctions but also by cognitive and/or psychiatric symptoms. An open issue is the extent to which these diseases are distinct entities. In this respect, here we compared cortical sources of resting state eyes‐closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms in PD and DLB patients having visual hallucinations. Method Clinical and rsEEG rhythms in demographic matched PD (N = 93), DLB (N = 46), Alzheimer’s disease dementia (AD, N= 70) and healthy elderly (Nold, N = 60) subjects were available from an international archive. Pathological groups were matched for cognitive status. Individual alpha frequency peak was used to determine the delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3 frequency band ranges. Fixed beta1, beta2, and gamma bands were considered. The eLORETA freeware estimated rsEEG cortical sources. Result As a confirmation of previous studies, compared to the Nold subjects, the AD, LBD, and PD patients showed higher widespread delta source activities and lower posterior alpha source activities. Specifically, posterior alpha source activities were more abnormal in the AD than the LBD and PD groups, while widespread delta source activities were more abnormal in the PD and DLB than the AD group. As novel results, in relation to the LBD and PD patients without visual hallucinations and the control groups (Nold, AD), those with visual hallucinations were characterized by higher parietal delta source activities (LBD, Figure 1) and parieto‐occipital alpha sources activities (PD, Figure 2). Conclusion These novel results suggest that in LBD and PD patients resting in the quiet wakefulness, abnormalities in cortical neural synchronization at delta and alpha frequencies in parietal cortex are differently related to visual hallucinations despite the essence of alpha‐synucleinopathy.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

Therefore, unconsciousness has the opposite meaning, that is, a state of unawareness of self and environment or a suspension of those mental activities by which people are made aware of themselves and their environment, coupled with a diminished responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness can have many different causes, for example, stroke, traumatic brain injury, anesthesia, brainstem lesions and sleep, the various causes of unconsciousness primarily interfering with different brain functions. Clinically, impaired consciousness such as coma, vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) is a very common manifestation in subjects with acquired brain injury. Unconsciousness does not always consist of a general suppression of the entire activity of the central nervous system. Depending on the actual cause(s), many functions, such as protective reflexes and various cognitive processes, can remain intact. The Management of such a patient in VS or MCS requires carefully reaching the correct diagnosis, pronouncing an evidence-based prognosis, and thoughtfully considering the medical, ethical, and legal elements of optimum treatment (Bernat, 2006).",

Visual self-stimulation, e.g. eye-pressing and light-gazing, normally is restricted to the visually impaired; prolonged eye-pressing is the most common. This behaviour depends on onset of visual impairment, age, degree and quality of residual light, type of ocular abnormality, the presence of additional handicaps, and the activities in which the child is involved. Children with bilateral optic-nerve defects never press their eyes; those with retinal disorders tend to press vigorously. A possible physiological explanation is that self-stimulation occurs when the demand of the brain for meaningful visual information is not adequately met.",

The comorbidity of medical conditions and bipolar affective disorders is a topic that warrants systematic research. Rapid cycling has been reported in various other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as head injury, stroke, learning disability, or rarer illnesses, such as cerebral sarcoidosis or tuberous sclerosis. Rapid-cycling bipolar affective disorders may concur with higher rates of substance-abuse disorders, but such an idea is mainly based on clinical observation or preliminary data. There is an overall tendency that mixed states and rapid-cycling forms of bipolar affective disorder constitute more unfavorable forms of the underlying illness. Mixed affective episodes have a link with anxiety disorders and anxious-dependent personality disorders. Rapid cycling may have a link with substance abuse and with certain neuropsychiatric disorders, or, perhaps, these neuropsychiatric disorders may mimic rapid cycling.",

      "abstract": "Dreaming is the result of the mental activity of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage, and less commonly of non-REM sleep. Dreams offer unique insights into the patients' brains, minds, and emotions. Based on neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies, the biological core of dreaming stands on some brain areas activated or inactivated. Dream abnormalities in neurological disorders include a reduction / cessation of dreaming, an increase in dream frequency, changes in dream contents and accompaniments, and the occurrence of dreamlike experiences (hallucinations) mainly during the wake- -sleep/sleep-wake transitions. Dream changes can be associated with several neurological conditions, and the unfolding of biological knowledge about dream experiences can also have significance in clinical practice. Regarding the dream importance in clinical neurological management, the aim of this paper encompasses a summary of sleep stages, dreams neurobiology including brain areas involved in the dreams, memory, and dreams, besides Dreams in the aging people and neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Developmental delay is a common problem in children, and often no specific cause is found. It is also not unusual for other neurological problems, such as epilepsy, to complicate the picture. The question is always whether the intellectual problems are due to a static defect, or are part of a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Many conditions declare themselves with the passage of years. However, a small but significant group of conditions are sufficiently indolent in their progress to cause no obvious deterioration until late adolescence or adulthood. In this situation, a parent or carer may ask the adult neurologist to assess whether the perceived decline in functioning is real, and if so, what the cause is. This situation is often far from clear-cut, and so I will try and provide some guidance for when this difficult diagnostic problem arises.

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

      "title": "Cognitive deficit in schizophrenia: an overview.",
      "abstract": "Depressive mood, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations and behavioral disturbances have been traditionally recognized as leading symptoms of mental disorders. However, cognitive symptoms went under-recognized or declined. Today there is robust evidence that cognitive dysfunction is present in the majority of mental disorders and is also related to impairments in the functioning of the persons with mental illness. It is proposed that aberrant brain neuronal network connectivity, arising from interplay of genetic, epigenetic, developmental and environmental factors, is responsible for cognitive decline. In schizophrenia, dysfunctions in working memory, attention, processing speed, visual and verbal learning with substantial deficit in reasoning, planning, abstract thinking and problem solving have been extensively documented. Social cognition - the ability to correctly process information and use it to generate appropriate response in situations, is also impaired. The correlation of cognitive impairment with functional outcome and employment, independent living and social functioning has emphasized the need for development of the treatments specific to cognition. It is considered that brain neuroplasticity allows for re-modulating and compensating the impairment process which could give opportunity to improve cognitive functions. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive clinical assessment and follow-up of cognitive decline in mental illness. Implementation of specific treatment strategies addressing cognitive decline in mental illness, like new drugs, distinct cognitive-behavioural therapy, psychoeducation, social skills training and remediation strategies should be strongly indorsed targeting recovery and reduction of disability due to mental illness.",

      "abstract": "Functional neurological symptoms refer to neurological symptoms that are not explained by disease. They may also be called psychogenic, non-organic, somatoform, dissociative or conversion symptoms. The most common functional neurological symptoms are non-epileptic attacks and functional weakness. These are common in neurology and general medical practice, especially in emergency situations, where they can be mistaken for epilepsy or stroke. Many studies have shown that these symptoms often persist, are associated with distress and disability and, in the right hands, have a low rate of misdiagnosis. Physicians are often uncertain how to approach patients with these problems. Are patients making up the symptoms? How can the diagnosis be made confidently? What is the best way to explain the diagnosis to the patient? Does treatment ever help? This review takes readers through these questions with practical tips for avoiding common pitfalls, both in diagnosis and management. There is no good evidence that these symptoms are any more 'made up' than irritable bowel symptoms or chronic pain. The diagnosis should usually be made by a neurologist on the basis of positive signs of inconsistency such as Hoover's sign or the typical features of a non-epileptic attack. A 'functional' model of the symptoms is useful both in thinking about the problem and when explaining the symptoms to the patient. There are many useful steps in management that do not require a detailed understanding of aetiology in an individual patient.",

Cognitive deficits are a key feature of schizophrenia and a primary cause of long-term disability. Current neurophysiological models of schizophrenia focus on distributed brain dysfunction with bottom-up as well as top-down components. Bottom-up deficits in cognitive processing are driven by impairments in basic perceptual processes that localize to primary sensory brain regions. Within the auditory system, deficits are apparent in elemental sensory processing, such as tone matching following brief delay. Such deficits lead to impairments in higher-order processes such as phonological processing and auditory emotion recognition. Within the visual system, deficits are apparent in functioning of the magnocellular visual pathway, leading to higher-order deficits in processes such as perceptual closure, object recognition, and reading. In both auditory and visual systems, patterns of deficit are consistent with underlying impairment of brain N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor systems.",

      "abstract": "Minimal criteria for diabetic neuropathy need to be defined and universally applied. Standardized evaluative procedures need to be agreed and normal ranges determined from healthy volunteers. Types and stages of neuropathy should be established and assessments performed on representative populations of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients. Potential minimal criteria include absent ankle reflexes and vibratory sensation, and abnormalities of nerve conduction. However, the preferred criterion is the identification of more than two statistically defined abnormalities among symptoms and deficits, nerve conduction, quantitative sensory examination or quantitative autonomic examination. Various evaluative procedures are available. Symptoms should be assessed and scores can be assigned to neurological deficits. However, assessments of nerve conduction provide the most specific, objective, sensitive, and repeatable procedures, although these may be the least meaningful. Many techniques are available for quantitative sensory examination, but are poorly standardized and normal values are not available. For quantitative autonomic examination, tests are available for the adequacy of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular reflexes and increasingly for other autonomic functions. In any assessment of nerve function the conditions should be optimized and standardized, and stimuli defined. Specific instructions should be given and normal ranges established in healthy volunteers.",

      "title": "Autoimmune and paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathies",
      "abstract": "Extract Key points ... Introduction Acute or subacute autonomic failure can be caused by certain drugs and toxins or in association with systemic disorders that affect the nerves more diffusely (e.g. diabetes, amyloidosis). Once these causes are excluded, many cases of acute or subacute autonomic failure may be attributed to autoimmunity targeting the autonomic nerves and/or ganglia. In addition to the time course of the symptoms, several clinical observations support this concept. Subacute autonomic failure may occur in association with known autoimmune neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome or acquired neuromyotonia, or may be associated with occult cancer (paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy). When subacute autonomic neuropathy occurs in isolation, the syndrome often follows a viral prodrome, has a monophasic course, and can be associated with elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and neuron-specific autoantibodies. Until recently, subacute idiopathic autonomic neuropathy was considered to be a pure autonomic variant of the Guillain–Barré syndrome, but recent evidence suggests that some cases, at least, may be due to a specific immune response to the α3-type neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in autonomic ganglia. Indeed, an animal model of autonomic failure has been induced by immunization against α3-type neuronal nicotinic AChR. The manifestations of autoimmune forms of peripheral autonomic failure are reviewed in this chapter with special consideration of autonomic dysfunction in cancer patients and the emerging experimental and laboratory evidence for specific autoantibodies in both cancer and non-cancer cases.",

Whereas pathognomonic motor signs are essential to diagnostic specificity, early symptoms important to recognition of a neurodegenerative disorder may be less apparent or diagnostically ambiguous. This observational study sought to identify the very earliest symptoms in the natural history of MSA. Detailed clinical histories focusing on early symptoms were obtained from 30 subjects recently diagnosed with MSA. Historical data were correlated with neurological examinations and laboratory autonomic testing. Subjects' mean age was 63.9 years. Ten were classified as having MSA-P and 20 MSA-C. The evaluations occurred 2.9 ± 0.4 months after diagnosis. The first symptom of MSA was autonomic in 22 (73%) and motor in 3 (10%) subjects (p < 0.0001). The most frequent first symptom was erectile failure, which occurred in all men beginning 4.2 ± 2.6 years prior to diagnosis. After erectile failure, postural lightheadness or fatigue following exercise, urinary urgency or hesitancy, and violent dream enactment behavior consistent with REM behavioral sleep disorder were the most frequent initial symptoms. Neither the order of symptom progression, which was highly variable, nor autonomic severity scores differentiated between MSA-P and MSA-C. The first symptoms of MSA are frequently autonomic and may predate recognition of motor manifestations. Orthostatic hypotension and, in men, erectile failure are among the first symptoms that, when evaluated in the context of associated clinical findings, may facilitate accurate and earlier diagnosis.",

Method: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Results: PPPD is a frequent entity that has been only recently well described. Diagnosis relies on anamnesis; posturography is helpful. High scores of depression, neuroticism and introversion may be a risk factor for PPPD. 25% of cases may be triggered by neurotologic events such as Vestibular migraine, which is more prevalent than Meniere's disease. There are alterations in activity and connectivity in the key central vestibular, visual and anxiety systems. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and especially Sertraline could be the medication of choice. Other SSRI or Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) may be chosen in case of comorbid psychiatric disorders or insufficient response to the first choice medication. Cognitive behavioural therapy, vestibular and balance rehabilitation therapy seem to be effective. Conclusion: PPPD seems to stem from a multi-sensory maladjustment. Symptoms of Vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease and PPPD are often overlapping, stressing the need for more precise diagnostic tools. Cognitive behavioural therapy and vestibular rehabilitation therapy have been recently proved to be effective therapeutic options for PPPD. However, there is little progress done concerning drug-treatments: SSRI and SNRI may help, but there is a need for larger controlled double-blind trials to confirm the effectiveness.",

A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "abstract": "The ability to function independently is crucial for successful aging, while an age through the development of involutional changes and risk of comorbidity promotes functional limitations. On average, 20% of people over 70 years of age need help in at least one of the 6 basic activities of daily living. The ability to cope in everyday life is affected by the reduction of physical fitness, sensory impairment and the effects of chronic conditions, falls and injuries. Deterioration of physical fitness is a consequence of muscle mass and strength reduction, impaired neuromuscular function resulted in slowing nerve conduction and reaction time, deterioration of balance, coordination and central transmission. Vision and hearing disorders are a consequence of aging and diseases. Cognition impairment, important for an independence, may be a consequence of degenerative changes in the CNS or dementia. Numerous studies have confirmed the relationship of involutional changes, accompanying diseases, falls and injures with limitations in daily functioning, and maintaining physical activity and implementation of a comprehensive geriatric assessment into geriatric care with an early diagnosis of deficits and implementation of intervention can prevent or delay the disclosure of disability.",

      "abstract": "Atypical forms of motor neuron disease represent a rare and diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders that differ from classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in terms of clinical presentation, genetic background, neuroimaging features, progression rate, and distribution of motor involvement. Diagnostic criteria of these variants include onset at a young or middle age, restriction to a specific anatomical region (bulbar or spinal), exclusive involvement of either the upper or lower motor neuron, the degree of motor neuron degeneration, absence of specific neuroimaging phenomena in certain subtypes, frequent association with other neurological symptoms (e.g., dystonia, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment), and slow progression. Depending on the predominant site of involvement, this pathology can be divided into two major categories: affecting the upper and lower motor neuron. The first group includes primary lateral sclerosis and Mills syndrome. The lower motor neuron group comprises a broader and more heterogeneous spectrum, including progressive bulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy, facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy syndrome, flail arm syndrome, Hirayama disease (monomelic amyotrophy), O’Sullivan-McLeod syndrome, flail leg syndrome, and finger extension weakness and downbeat nystagmus motor neuron disease. A concise clinical characterization of each variant is provided. This article describes original clinical cases of two atypical motor neuron disease variants, i.e. O’Sullivan-McLeod syndrome and flail leg syndrome, analyzed in the context of a comprehensive literature review. Both cases, characterized by lower (peripheral) motor neuron involvement, underscore the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and the complexity of the diagnostic process, illustrating the necessity of a broad, multimodal diagnostic approach and emphasizing the importance of dynamic patient monitoring. In such scenarios, time itself becomes a key diagnostic factor.",

The condition primarily involves the central nervous system and the most involved structures are basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem. In this disorder, there is a progressive loss of mental and movement abilities associated with abnormal muscle tones, weakness, visual loss, respiratory failure, and strikingly, we got raised lactate levels in the blood, cerebral spinal fluid, and other body fluids. The prognosis of this condition is bad as there is no effective treatment and finally, the patient succumbs to death mostly due to respiratory failure. Here, we present a case of Leigh disease in an 8-month-old boy having chief complaints of delayed motor (weakness), and cognitive development with a previous history of recurrent respiratory infection. Upon recent radiological imaging, gross neurological abnormalities were seen which suggested the possibility of Leigh disease which was further confirmed by raised body fluid lactate levels.",

      "title": "Functional Movement Disorders: Attention, Agency and Beliefs",
      "abstract": "This work centers around three aspects of the likely pathophysiology of functional movement disorders: attention, agency and beliefs. The most characteristic, yet intriguing feature of functional neurological disorders is that symptoms typically manifest with attention and improve or disappear with distraction. In an attempt to elucidate what the abnormal attentional focus is, it was manipulated onto different aspects of a reaching movement. Attention in functional tremor seems to be misdirected to the ongoing visual feedback of the movement and this seems to partly contribute to the symptoms. Furthermore, the attention network test indicates that the executive network is impaired. Functional movement disorders share many characteristics with voluntary movements, raising the question whether it is in fact the sense of agency that is the primary abnormality in this disorder. The sense of agency was measured in the context of different attentional foci and with subliminal and supraliminal priming. No abnormalities were detected, although this might have been linked to methodological difficulties. Subliminal priming confirmed that implicit motor control is normal in patients with functional movement disorders. Functional neurological disorders sometimes appear to follow lay beliefs. In order to evaluate if their beliefs about their symptoms are abnormal, functional tremor patients’ perception of their tremor was evaluated in real time and in retrospect. It was found to be accurate and not dissimilar to organic tremor patients’ perception. Attempting to change their beliefs, by modifying the visual feedback they were given did not have any lasting effect on functional nor organic tremor. Dramatic placebo effects are occasionally observed in functional neurological disorders, having led to the conclusion that patients with these disorders are suggestible. A classic placebo analgesia experiment did not show stronger placebo responses in patients with functional neurological disorders than healthy controls, suggesting that the notion of suggestibility is mistaken.",

As a result of the anatomical distribution of upper and lower motor neurons, acute spinal cord lesions almost always present with hyperreflexia.

      "abstract": "Objective: Psychotic symptoms could be first presentation of neurological disorder before the appearance of cognitive and motor disturbance. This can lead to diagnosis of psychiatric illness in early phase and later appearance of motor disturbances could be seen as a side effect of anti-psychotic medications, leading to the delayed diagnosis of primary neurological disorder. The objective of this case to present a patient diagnosed initially with schizophrenia but careful consideration of pattern of motor abnormality and cognitive decline resulted in final diagnosis of Huntington disease behind schizophrenia.  Methods: A patient of schizophrenia with cognitive decline and motor disturbance was investigated for the possibility of an undiagnosed neurological disorder.  Results: Decline in patient’s cognitive functions appeared to be rapid and severe as compared to relatively short duration of diagnosed psychiatric illness. Also motor abnormality of ataxia and choroeathtoid movements after improvement in features suggestive of antipsychotic induced parkinsonism, ie. bradykinesia, rigidity and tremors do not appear to be explained by psychotic illness only. Later, genetic testing for CAG trinucleotide repeats resulted in a primary diagnosis of Huntington disease. Conclusion: The index case suggests the need for analysis of motor abnormality and cognitive decline in a patient with a diagnosis of psychotic illness before attributing them to be the consequence of psychiatric illness. Whenever there is suspicion, further assessment for a neurological disorder should be performed, which may provide the opportunity for early diagnosis and accurate treatment of both entities.

Many patients develop only extrapyramidal and autonomic symptoms, but in most of these cases, subsequent neuropathologic studies also demonstrate degenerative changes in the cerebellum and brainstem. 3,4 The term MSA encompasses striatonigral degeneration (SND), the Shy-Drager syndrome (SDS), and many cases of sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy (sOPCA). Autopsy examination discloses neuronal loss and gliosis within some or all of the following structures: inferior olives, pons, cerebellum, substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, striatum (mainly putamen), and the intermediolateral columns and Onufs nucleus of the spinal cord. 5\n\nRecently there have been descriptions of distinctive neuropathologic features of MSA consisting of oligodendroglial 6–11 and neuronal 12–14 intracytoplasmic and intranuclear argyrophilic inclusions containing accumulations of tubular structures.

Caracteriza-se por episódios de sono excessivamente prolongados, alterações comportamentais e aumento do apetite. A causa exata dessa síndrome ainda é desconhecida, e o diagnóstico é baseado na observação dos sintomas clínicos característicos. Métodos: Pesquisadores conduziram revisões sistemáticas da literatura médica e analisaram estudos de caso e séries de casos publicados para investigar a síndrome de Kleine-Levin. Durante esse processo, foram identificados critérios diagnósticos e características clínicas comuns entre os pacientes afetados. Resultados: A análise revelou que a síndrome afeta predominantemente indivíduos masculinos. Durante os episódios agudos, os pacientes experimentam períodos de sono excessivo, cerca de 18 a 20 horas por dia. Além disso, manifestam sintomas como desorientação, confusão mental, dificuldade de concentração, alucinações, sensibilidade aumentada aos estímulos sensoriais, comportamentos compulsivos. Conclusões: A síndrome de Kleine-Levin é uma condição rara e complexa que afeta o sono, o comportamento e o apetite dos indivíduos afetados. Embora a causa exata ainda seja desconhecida, evidências apontam para possíveis influências genéticas e ambientais no seu desenvolvimento. O diagnóstico baseia-se na observação dos sintomas clínicos característicos, uma vez que não há exames específicos para confirmar a presença da síndrome.

      "title": "Hidden manifestations of multiple sclerosis: a current view on pathogenesis and clinical significance",
      "abstract": "In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), hidden symptoms such as cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction significantly affect quality of life and contribute to disability progression. Despite high prevalence, these symptoms often remain underestimated and underdiagnosed in clinical practice. The pathogenesis of hidden manifestations in MS is multifactorial, involving inflammatory, neurodegenerative, vascular, metabolic, and psychosocial mechanisms. Cognitive impairment in patients with MS most commonly includes decreased information processing, memory deficits, and executive dysfunction. Depression and anxiety frequently co-occur; depressive symptoms are associated with hippocampal changes and cortico-limbic network alterations, while anxiety is linked to dysregulation of limbic structures and neuroinflammatory processes. Fatigue is one of the most disabling symptoms in MS, with its pathoge­nesis involving grey matter atrophy, and thalamic lesions. Sexual dysfunction affects more than half of patients and may arise from neurological (primary), somatic (secondary), or psychosocial (tertiary) factors. This review aims to summarize current data on hidden manifestations of MS, their pathogenic mechanisms and clinical significance, as well as to highlight new diagnostic trends. The literature search was performed using Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases with the keywords “multiple sclerosis”, “cognitive impairment”, “depression”, “anxiety”, “fatigue”, and “sexual dysfunction.” Additional references were identified through manual bibliography screening.",

      "title": "Migraine: A Chronic Sympathetic Nervous System Disorder",
      "abstract": "Objective.—To determine the degree of diagnostic and clinical similarity between chronic sympathetic nervous system disorders and migraine. Background.—Migraine is an episodic syndrome consisting of a variety of clinical features that result from dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system. During headache‐free periods, migraineurs have a reduction in sympathetic function compared to nonmigraineurs. Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is also the major feature of rare neurological disorders such as pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. There are no known reports in the medical literature, however, comparing sympathetic nervous system function in individuals with migraine, pure autonomic failure, and multiple system atrophy. Methods.—A detailed review of the literature was performed to compare the results of a wide variety of diagnostic tests and clinical signs that have been described in these 3 heretofore unrelated disorders. Results.—The data indicate that migraine shares significant diagnostic and clinical features with both pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy, yet represents a distinct subtype of chronic sympathetic dysfunction. Migraine is most similar to pure autonomic failure in terms of reduced supine plasma norepinephrine levels, peripheral adrenergic receptor supersensitivity, and clinical symptomatology directly related to sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. The peripheral sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is much more severe in pure autonomic failure than in migraine. Migraine differs from both pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy in that migraineurs retain the ability, although suboptimal, to increase plasma norepinephrine levels following physiological stressors. Conclusions.—The major finding of the present study is that migraine is a disorder of chronic sympathetic dysfunction, sharing many diagnostic and clinical characteristics with pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. However, the sympathetic nervous system dysfunction in migraine differs from pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy in that occurs in an anatomically intact system. It is proposed that the sympathetic dysfunction in migraine relates to an imbalance of sympathetic co‐transmitters. Specifically, it is suggested that a migraine attack is characterized by a relative depletion of sympathetic norepinephrine stores in conjunction with an increase in the release of other sympathetic cotransmitters such as dopamine, prostaglandins, adenosine triphosphate, and adenosine. An enhanced understanding of the sympathetic dysfunction in migraine may help to more effectively diagnose, prevent, and/or treat migraine and other types of headache.",

Design and Methods:In a retrospective study, we evaluated 48 nondemented, nondepressed patients with clinical and psychometric evidence of memory impairment who were followed up for 2 or more years.Ageadjusted normative criteria were used to identify whether additional impairments were present in language, attention, motor visuospatial function, and verbal fluency at this initial evaluation.The presence or absence of dementia after 2 years and at the most recent neurological evaluation was compared in subjects with normal scores in all 4 of these cognitive areas apart from memory (M-) and those with impairment in 1 or more of these areas (M+).Outcomes were adjusted for age, intelligence at initial evaluation, and years of education.",

      "abstract": "This scientific commentary refers to ‘ECHS1 mutations in Leigh disease: a new inborn error of metabolism affecting valine metabolism’ by Peters et al. (doi:10.1093/awu216). \n\nMitochondrial disorders are the most common inherited metabolic abnormalities of energy production. Patients can present with a wide variety of clinical phenotypes depending on the tissue affected. In general, tissues with the highest energy demands, such as brain, muscle, heart and liver, are the most severely affected. Several neurological syndromes are caused by defective mitochondrial energy production, of which Leigh syndrome is one of the best known. Leigh syndrome is an often fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, first described in 1951 by the British psychiatrist and neuropathologist Denis Leigh (1951). Typically, patients with Leigh syndrome present with focal, bilateral lesions commonly found in the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, brainstem or spinal cord. Clinical symptoms depend on the affected area of the CNS and include among others hypotonia, psychomotor delay, dystonia, seizures, ataxia, dysphagia and failure to thrive.\n\nThe first cases of Leigh syndrome were suggested to result from a deficiency of thiamine metabolism on the basis of their similarity with Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Remarkably, a direct link between Leigh syndrome and defective thiamine metabolism was only proven 60 years later by the identification of pathogenic mutations in hTHTR2 (now known as SLC19A3), a thiamine transporter, in patients with Leigh syndrome (Gerards et al., 2013). To date, mutations in over 35 genes have been associated with the disorder and this number is increasing annually.

      "abstract": "Presenile dementia does not appear to be a well-defined clinico-anatomical entity, and single case studies are helpful in elucidating the problem of pathogenesis and classification. Two cases of presenile dementia are described. One is that of a man who, at the age of 52, developed the typical organic syndrome, with certain signs of focal cortical impairment such as aphasia, paraphasia and disturbances of reading, writing and picture recognition. After severe general deterioration he died at the age of 60, and post-mortem examination revealed the typical histological features of Alzheimer's disease. The second case is that of a woman who at about the age of 42 began to show unspecific symptoms such as diffuse anxiety, definite phobias and general restlessness, suggestive of a psychoneurosis or the beginning of a functional psychosis. After several years she gradually developed severe disorders of conduct, intellectual and speech impairment. She died in a state of extreme organic dementia and physical deterioration at the age of 48. Post-mortem examination showed severe generalized cortical atrophy (brain weight 864 gms.) with the signs of senility except that the characteristic histological features of Alzheimer's disease were entirely absent. It has been suggested (Lewy 1925, Spatz 1925) that the process of ageing manifests itself in the central nervous system along two different lines. Atrophy, brown pigment, proliferation of interstitial tissue represent the \"primary\" phenomena of ageing, and are not confined to the central nervous system or to man. However, the combination of neurofibrillary changes and argentophile plaques is a \"secondary\" phenomenon of ageing which occurs only in man and in the phylogenetically most recent structures of the nervous system. The two cases here presented demonstrate that the \"primary\" and \"secondary\" phenomena of ageing occur independently. The significance of this fact and its clinical and pathological implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Definition of stroke In epidemiological studies, stroke is defined by clinical findings and symptoms [1]: rapidly developed signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours (unless interrupted by surgery or death), with no apparent cause other than a vascular origin. This approach is supplemented with neuroimaging but even with advanced imaging techniques the diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Therefore, precise definitions of clinical signs are needed. WHO definitions are [1]: Definite focal signs: unilateral or bilateral motor impairment (including dyscoordination) unilateral or bilateral sensory impairment aphasis/dysphasis (non-fluent speech) hemianopia (half-sided impairment of visual fields) diplopia forced gaze (conjugate deviation) dysphagia of acute onset apraxia of acute onset ataxia of acute onset perception deficit of acute onset. Not acceptable as sole evidence of focal dysfunction: dizziness, vertigo localized headache blurred vision of both eyes dysarthria (slurred speech) impaired cognitive function (including confusion) impaired consciousness seizures. (Although strokes can present in this way, these signs are not specific and cannot therefore be accepted as definite evidence of stroke.) Neuroimaging studies are needed for classification of stroke by subtypes: subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain infarction (necrosis). Although there may be large variations in stroke subtype distributions between populations, thrombotic and embolic strokes are responsible for about 80–85% of all strokes in the Indo-European populations, and as low as 65% in some Asian populations. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represents 5–10% of all strokes, and occurs more often in younger subjects, while both intracerebral and especially thrombotic and embolic stroke increase markedly with age.",

Functional (psychogenic) neurological diseases, also called conversion disorders, are involuntary. There are two voluntary mimics of functional disorders: factitious disease, where patients have a psychiatric illness, and malingering, where persons have no illness and are just lying. The term “functional” is beginning to replace “psychogenic” in many circumstances. This chapter discusses clinical features of functional neurological disorders in detail. Negative neurological symptoms like loss of consciousness, blindness, constriction of visual field, motor paralysis, and loss of pain sense are commonly seen in functional diseases, but positive symptoms like convulsion and involuntary movements are more common. Among others, functional movement disorders are not infrequent and have drawn particular attention in the recent years. Within the movement disorders, functional tic-like movements might be difficult to distinguish from real tics, and in fact these two may overlap within the patient.",

      "abstract": "While insomnia is the second most common mental disorder, progress in our understanding of underlying neurobiological mechanisms has been limited. The present review addresses the definition and prevalence of insomnia and explores its subjective and objective characteristics across the 24-hour day. Subsequently, the review extensively addresses how the vulnerability to develop insomnia is affected by genetic variants, early life stress, major life events, and brain structure and function. Further supported by the clear mental health risks conveyed by insomnia, the integrated findings suggest that the vulnerability to develop insomnia could rather be found in brain circuits regulating emotion and arousal than in circuits involved in circadian and homeostatic sleep regulation. Finally, a testable model is presented. The model proposes that in people with a vulnerability to develop insomnia, the locus coeruleus is more sensitive to-or receives more input from-the salience network and related circuits, even during rapid eye movement sleep, when it should normally be sound asleep. This vulnerability may ignite a downward spiral of insufficient overnight adaptation to distress, resulting in accumulating hyperarousal, which, in turn, impedes restful sleep and moreover increases the risk of other mental health adversity. Sensitized brain circuits are likely to be subjectively experienced as \"sleeping with one eye open\". The proposed model opens up the possibility for novel intervention studies and animal studies, thus accelerating the ignition of a neuroscience of insomnia, which is direly needed for better treatment.",

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

Assessment of these impairments is complicated by impairments in the accuracy of self-assessment of functioning on the part of both people with schizophrenia and certain classes of informants. Many of these reports correlate close to zero with performance measured objectively by performance-based tests. Much like the phenomenon of lack of insight, unawareness of functional impairments is predicted by cognitive impairments. In addition, like other neuropsychiatric conditions and healthy individuals, mild depression is associated with increased accuracy of self-assessment. High-contact clinicians may provide reports of functioning that are more convergent with patients' ability as measured by performance-based assessments.

      "title": "Role of neuron specific enolase as a biomarker in Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is thought to be the most common neurodegenerative disease with movement disorder. The key motor symptoms are rigidity, tremor, akinesis/hypokinesia/bradykinesia, and postural instability. However, in our day-to-day clinical practice we tend to see several other symptoms which may be motor or non-motor. Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are quite common and debilitating. The pathological hallmarks of PD are loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPc) and accumulation of unfolded or misfolded alpha-synuclein. Diagnosis of PD is difficult in the pre-motor stage. Late diagnosis renders a substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons in SNPc and spread of disease in other parts of the brain. This may manifest as either full blown symptoms requiring multiple medications or may even lead to life threatening condition due to lack of early diagnostic tools and techniques. Biomarkers are required to diagnose PD at a very early stage when prevention is possible. Hence, we see a lot of interest among researchers involved in finding a biomarker specific to the disease. Biomarkers may be clinical, image based, genetic, and biochemical. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum markers which may correlate with disease pathophysiology are of great significance. One such molecule which recently gained a lot of attention is neuron-specific enolase (NSE). The main aim of this paper is to highlight the role of NSE in predicting neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation ultimately reflecting damage of brain cells in PD.",

According to pathological and neuroimaging studies, the traditional view of Parkinson's disease that begins with the development of motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, has begun to change. It is now understood that there would be a \"premotor\" or \"preclinical\" period in which the alphasynuclein pathology begins outside of the substantia nigra in the lower brainstem and autonomic nervous system. Although the pathophysiology of this phase is still unclear, it is currently thought that its symptoms would correspond to the so-called \"non-motor symptoms\". Hyposmia, depression, constipation and REM sleep disorders are one of the most relevant non-motor symptoms at this \"premotor\" stage. The spectrum of non-motor symptoms is very broad and covers the domains of neuropsychiatric, dysautonomic, gastrointestinal and sensory symptoms as well as sleep disorders. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, impulse control disorder, psychosis and dementia, are a major cause of disability as they are directly related to quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Pruritus, better known as itch, is ‘an unpleasant cutaneous sensation provoking the desire to scratch’.1 It is typically caused by pruritogens that activate nerve endings in cutaneous and transitional tissues (eg, conjunctivae, anal mucosa) and serves a protective function against noxious stimuli.\n\nItch can also occur with diseased or malfunctioning pruritogenic neurones in the absence of a pruritogen—a symptom termed neuropathic pruritus or neuropathic itch.2 Neuropathic pruritus is a well described but under-recognised symptom of neurological disorders. The site of involvement may be (i) peripheral nerve and root, (ii) spinal cord or (iii) brain. It may accompany a variety of peripheral and central neurological disorders, including postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, traumatic nerve injury, complex regional pain syndrome, multiple sclerosis and stroke.3\n\nNeuromyelitis optica is a relapsing inflammatory astrocytopathic disorder affecting predominantly the optic nerves and spinal cord. It is associated with antiaquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) in up to 70% of patients. Spinal cord involvement typically presents as a longitudinally-extensive transverse myelitis with associated sensorimotor and sphincter dysfunction. Sensory symptoms such as numbness, dysaesthesia, pain and tonic spasms are common.4 This report highlights neuropathic pruritus as an under-recognised feature of neuromyelitis optica.\n\nA 45-year-old woman with no previous medical history presented with a 4-day history of unexplained nausea, vomiting, hiccup and vertigo. On the fourth day, she developed bilateral forearm itching. Over the following 3 days, she developed rapidly progressive weakness from the chest down, ultimately resulting in complete paraplegia, sensory loss and loss of both bladder and bowel function. She also developed weakness in both arms, worse on the left side.\n\nShe was admitted 3 days after the onset of her nausea and vomiting, which subsided a day later. However, the itching …",

The disorder is expressed in newborns by tremulous shaking of the head, body and tail, difficulty in rising, a wobbly spastic gait, and aphonia. Transient improvement is followed by deterioration and progressive spastic paraplegia. Generalized tremors can be induced easily by a variety of stimuli, and spinal reflexes may be exaggerated or depressed. The major pathological finding is an excessive accumulation of neurofilaments within neurons of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems. The involvement of multiple systems of neurons and the similarity with some forms of human motor neuron disease and spinocerebellar degeneration suggest that this unique bovine disease may serve as a suitable animal model for these human neurodegenerative disorders.",

Delirium leads to poor outcomes: increased cost, worsened cognition, increased risk of falls, institutionalization, and increased mortality. A single factor can lead to delirium development; however, more often, the cause for delirium is multifactorial. Underlying causes such as an infection, electrolyte imbalance, and deliriogenic medications combined with underlying risk factors contribute to delirium. Delirium is thought to be reversible, although severe, prolonged delirium may have permanent cognitive effects. Following full treatment with clinical improvement, delirium may linger for weeks to months - its trajectory can be challenging to predict.

Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

In other words, these symptoms have been considered to be categorically different from other forms of human behavior and experience, whether they occur in healthy persons or patients with other psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we advocate a dimensional approach to negative symptoms, which is supported by two main arguments. First, enduring negative symptoms can even be observed in a variety of psychiatric disorders and they are not specific to schizophrenia. Second, we review evidence that negative symptoms show a continuous distribution from apparently healthy subjects to those with a fully developed clinical syndrome. Although the evidence does not allow for a definite decision concerning the dimensional distribution of negative symptoms, it certainly justifies exploring a dimensional approach with respect to its clinical and scientific utility. Understanding negative symptoms as a variation of normal mental processes will strengthen the development of neurocognitive models and treatment approaches.",

Main clinical features include silver-leaden hair, bronze skin after sun exposure, and neurologic involvement (seizures, severe hypotonia, and mental retardation). Large granules of melanin unevenly distributed in the hair shaft are observed. Abnormal melanocytes and melanosomes and abnormal inclusion bodies in fibroblasts may be present. Differential diagnosis with Chédiak-Higashi syndrome and Griscelli syndrome must be done.We studied pediatric patients with silvery hair and profound neurologic dysfunction. Immune impairment was absent. Age of onset of neurologic signs ranged from 1 month to 11 years; the signs included severe muscular hypotonia, ocular alterations, and seizures. Mental retardation since the first months of life was noted in 4 cases. Psychomotor development was normal in 3 cases, but suddenly the patients presented with a regressive neurologic process. Four patients died between 6 months and 3 years after the onset of neurologic dysfunction. One patient showed characteristic ultrastructural findings of Elejalde syndrome.Elejalde syndrome is different from Chédiak-Higashi and Griscelli syndrome and is characterized by silvery hair and frequent occurrence of fatal neurologic alterations. Psychomotor impairment may have 2 forms of presentation: congenital or infantile. Although Elejalde syndrome and Griscelli syndrome are similar, the possibility that they are 2 different diseases, although probably allelic related, is suggested.",

      "title": "On General Paralysis",
      "abstract": "In attempting to describe the rise and progress of the paralysis, that forms one of the most remarkable symptoms of ‘paralytic insanity,’ I propose to notice first the affection of the muscles of the tongue, which is generally that which most strongly arrests the attention of the physician, who sees a patient in the second or fully-developed stage of the malady. In the last stage, the power of articulation is entirely gone; in both of these the paralysis is so marked, and the evidence of mental disease so clear, that the nature of the case can hardly be mistaken. It is in the very onset of the malady, that the peculiar lisp or failure of utterance, indicating disorder of the nervous centres, at or near the orifice of the nerves supply in the tongue muscles, is of paramount importance in the diagnosis, because if this symptom be superadded to eccentricity of conduct, or distinct delusion, there can remain but little doubt as to the existence of this special and almost invariably fatal form of disease. The alienist physician accustomed to watch the progress of general paralysis, and to recognize its slightest indication, cannot mistake the faulty pronounciation in question, for that of any other form of malady; but inasmuch as there are several affections of the speech that might mislead an unskilled practitioner, it may be useful to describe some of these derangements of the apparatus of articulation, and specify their points of difference. In the first place, an affection of the speech, very much resembling the embarassed articulation of incipient paralytic insanity, may be the result of temporary local congestion at the base of the brain, or may be produced by sudden fright, or by the action of poisons, particularly aconite; the indistinct utterance attending intoxication, is a familiar instance of poisoning of this kind: and all these are easily distinguished by the suddenness of their occurrence, and by their history, from the stutter of general paralysis. The articulation of the habitual stammerer is sometimes not unlike that which is the result of serious organic mischief; and still more striking in its resemblance, is the hesitation of speech, that may be observed in some cases of poisoning by lead. The ordinary signs of saturnine poisoning, the blue gum-line, the dropping of the wrist, &amp;c., will mark this latter malady—the history of the case will prevent any mistake in the former. I may mention here, that I believe it to be an exceptional occurrence to find a person of unsound mind who stammers; such a case at least must be very uncommon, a fact which I can only account for on the supposition that the greater disease prevents any manifestation of the minor nervous derangement.",

      "title": "An Evaluation of Psychobiologic Factors in the Re-Education Phase of the Kenny Treatment for Infantile Paralysis*",
      "abstract": "In addition to being studied as a function of the neuromuscular system, muscular activity should be studied also as a function of the total organism as embodied in the concept of the personality and its functions. “Mental alienation” is composed of a sensory factor (“loss of mental awareness”) and a motor factor (“mental alienation” in its narrower sense) and is therefore not one but two distinct though related symptoms. From the definitions and descriptions of “loss of mental awareness” and “mental alienation” given by Miss Kenny and her associates, it cannot be stated with certainty what roles structural, physiologic and psychobiologic changes play in their production. There are certain aspects of these symptoms which bear a resemblance to well recognized psychobiologic and psychopathologic reactions. “Loss of mental awareness” seems to correspond to psychosensory (proprioceptive) dissociation and “mental alienation” to psychomotor dissociation. Therefore it appears that these symptoms may be explained more satisfactorily on the basis of psychobiologic dissociation than on the basis of “physiologic block” as has been attempted by the group of physicians associated with Miss Kenny. “Muscular incoordination” also described by this group is a natural consequence of “loss of mental awareness” and “mental alienation” as well as of pain, spasm and actual paralysis and as such is one of several factors in the production of a series of personality adjustments which may stretch throughout the patient's active life. In the treatment of these symptoms Miss Kenny employs a number of well established psychotherapeutic principles. By means of the Kenny treatment it is to be expected that not only will the chronic physical crippling of infantile paralysis be curbed but that chronic changes in personality functioning also will be interrupted. Careful psychiatric study of case material will prove whether the above concept is essentially near the truth, and to what extent personality factors influence the elaboration and persistence of the symptoms “loss of mental awareness,” “mental alienation” and “muscular incoordination.” Once developed, these symptoms may in turn influence the personality functions of individuals to varying degrees. Finally, this syndrome comprising disturbances in the proprioceptive and motor functions of the personality is not peculiar to infantile paralysis. Rather, it appears to be the psychobiologic reaction to muscular immobilization due to any cause and has as its background not cellular pathology alone but the entire psychobiologic organization of the individual.",

      "abstract": "Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a common cause of dizziness and vertigo. This term was first described fairly recently by the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders in 2017. The symptoms include unsteadiness, vertigo or dizziness, lasting at least 15 days per month for 3 months or longer. The symptoms are exacerbated by upright posture, standing, walking or in the presence of various visual stimuli. The cause of this disorder is still unknown, although it is believed that it is related with the discoordination of the peripheral sensory and the central nervous systems. The onset of dizziness has been explained as the result of failure of integrating visual, vestibular and proprioreceptive signals into the central nervous system. The symptoms are often succeeding a previous vestibular disorder, e.g. vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière’s disease or other disorders. Psychological factors also play a part in the onset of PPPD – patients quite frequently present a history of anxiety, neurotic tendencies and depression. PPPD diagnosis is clinical, a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination are crucial. In order to diagnose PPPD correctly, a set of all five criteria, established by the Bárány society, should be met. The treatment is usually multimodal, consisting of vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive behaviour therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).This review describes the term of PPPD, the symptoms of the disease, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, comorbidities, also the diagnostic criteria and treatment of PPPD. The purpose of this article is to educate about this disease and to encourage more research, as well to seek better care for patients, accomplished by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.",

      "abstract": "In 30 patients with diabetic neuropathy sensory potentials in the median nerve, motor conduction in the lateral popliteal and median nerves, and electromyographic findings in distal and proximal muscles were compared with the severity of symptoms and signs. All patients had abnormalities in at least one of the electrophysiological parameters. The sensory potentials were the most sensitive indicator of subclinical involvement; abnormalities were found in 24 patients, 12 of whom had no sensory symptoms or signs and five of whom had no other clinical or electrophysiological evidence of neuropathy in the upper extremities. This indicates that sensory nerve fibres may be affected before motor. The next most sensitive parameter was the presence of fibrillation potentials, found in more than half the distal muscles examined. Slowing in motor conduction in the lateral popliteal nerve was the only electrophysiological change correlated to the severity of the neuropathy, and no other electrophysiological parameter was correlated to the duration or the severity of the neuropathy or the diabetes. An onset of neuropathy before or simultaneously with the manifestations of the diabetes, as well as the frequent occurrence of asymptomatic changes in sensory conduction, support the evidence at hand that the neuropathy develops concomitantly with and as an integral part of the metabolic disturbance rather than as a consequence of the vascular complications of diabetes. Of three patients with clinical signs or symptoms of a diabetic amyotrophy, two had asymptomatic electrophysiological abnormalities in distal nerves and muscles, consistent with widespread involvement of the peripheral nerves. The third patient had electromyographic changes in the medial vastus muscles suggestive of a myopathy. Motor and sensory conduction in distal and proximal nerves were normal.",

      "title": "GAN-Related Neurodegeneration",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics GAN-related neurodegeneration comprises a phenotypic continuum ranging from severe (sometimes called classic giant axonal neuropathy) to milder pure early-onset peripheral motor and sensory neuropathies. The classic giant axonal neuropathy phenotype typically manifests as an infantile-onset neurodegenerative disorder, starting as a severe peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy and evolving into central nervous system impairment (intellectual disability, seizures, cerebellar signs, and pyramidal tract signs). Most affected individuals become wheelchair dependent in the second decade of life and eventually bedridden with severe polyneuropathy, ataxia, and dementia. Death usually occurs in the third decade. At the milder end of the spectrum are predominantly motor and sensory neuropathies (with little to no CNS involvement) that overlap with the axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GAN-related neuropathy is established in a proband with suggestive findings and biallelic GAN pathogenic variants identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care is focused on managing the clinical findings of the individual, and often involves a team including neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, physiotherapists, occupational and physical therapists, psychologists, and speech-language pathologists. Major goals are to optimize intellectual and physical development. Surveillance: Surveillance is individualized to monitor response to ongoing interventions and identify new manifestations. Genetic counseling GAN-related neuropathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a GAN pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of inheriting biallelic pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial pathogenic variants. Once the GAN pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Control of symptoms: cognitive dysfunction",
      "abstract": "In a relatively small percentage of ALS patients a frontotemporal-type dementia may occur. A significant percentage of non-demented patents may show mild to moderate cognitive change, predominantly of a dysexecutive nature. Memory deficits may occur, and language involvement has been noted. Disease-related factors, mood disorder, and medication may compound cognitive impairment and must be accounted for when assessing cognition. There has been no research into the effectiveness of psychological interventions for cognitive dysfunction in ALS, although cognitive neuropsychological rehabilitation techniques may be applicable. The development of interventions for behavioural changes that may occur may be guided by approaches used in other neurodegenerative diseases, especially frontotemporal dementias. People with ALS should have access to clinical neuropsychologists who can assess the presence of cognitive dysfunction, undertake behavioural assessments, and work alongside other members of the clinical team to ensure the best outcome for ALS patients and their carers.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is one of the most significant of human behaviors, occupying roughly one-third of human life. Sleep disorders are one of the most common clinical problems encountered in outpatient settings and inpatient settings. Lack of sleep can lead to the inability to concentrate, memory complaints, and deficits in neuropsychological testing. Additionally, sleep disorders can have serious consequences, including fatal accidents related to sleepiness. Disturbed sleep can be a primary diagnosis itself or a component of another medical or psychiatric disorder. Narcolepsy is plausibly caused by an abnormality of REM-inhibiting mechanisms, and recent research involving hypocretin, a neurotransmitter, suggests that hypocretin is significantly reduced in narcolepsy patients. Patients with delayed and advanced sleep phase insomnia can be treated with proper timing of bright light and behavioral changes. Hypersomnia related to a mental disorder is usually found in a variety of conditions such as the early stages of mild depressive disorder, grief, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and somatoform disorders.",

      "title": "Common Generalized Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "There is reason to presume the existence of an epileptological disease entity called 'common generalized epilepsy' (CGE) with generalized-synchronous seizure discharges and strictly nonfocal seizures (petit mal, grand mal, myoclonus) occurring chiefly in the age range from 4 to 16 years. There is no evidence of causative pathology. The basic functional disturbance is likely to involve arousal mechanisms ('dyshormia') and/or photosensitivity. The genetic factor is highly complex. This entity must be differentiated from electrically or epileptologically very similar conditions. Among 300 epileptics with predominantly generalized seizure discharges in the EEG, only 20% (61 patients) fell into the category or 'pure' CGE; another 24% (72 patients) were listed as atypical CGE and showed additional minimal focal abnormalities or evidence of insult to the brain in the history. Other conditions giving rise to generalized seizure discharges are hereditary essential myoclonus epilepsy (Lafora-Unverricht-Lundborg), deep seated lesions (hypothalamus, mesencephalon) and metabolic disturbances; this group amounted to no more than 4% (12 patients). A primary cortical epileptogenic focus giving rise to 'secondary bilateral synchrony' was presumed in 9% (26 patients). A large group of 125 patients (42%) were characterized by slow spike-wave complexes and mental retardation (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome). The 4 remaining patients (1%) had slow spike-wave complexes but represented an unusual type of post-traumatic epilepsy without the ictal-clinical symptomatology of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The physiopathogenesis of CGE and its generalized seizure patterns is discussed.",

      "abstract": "The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of genetically inherited lysosomal neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment storage material that causes progressive neurologic degeneration in all age groups. They belong to the group of lysosomal storage disorders. The clinical course includes progressive dementia, seizures, progressive visual failure (except in the adult-onset forms), and often movement abnormalities. Collectively, these disorders are the most common cause of an inherited childhood neurodegenerative disease and are increasingly recognized in late-onset or adult-onset forms. Classic infantile CLN1 disease is caused by an alteration in the PPT1 gene. It is a genetic disorder with an onset of symptoms between 6 and 24 months of age, with recorded later presented CNL1 diseases, juvenile and early adult. Symptoms may include signs of intellectual and motor decline including delays in reaching developmental milestones (development delays), twitching or jerking of muscles (myoclonic jerks), and seizures.\r\n Early diagnosis of CLN1 (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses type 1) disease is crucial to ensure optimum care for patients and their families. CLN1 disease is diagnosed by measuring the activity of the enzyme PPT1. This enzyme is necessary for the proper functioning of lysosomes. The function of this lysosomal thioesterase is to remove the fatty acids bound by thioester bonds to cysteine residues in proteins.\r\n In this study, the aim is to introduce a method for measuring the activity of an enzyme palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 in a sample of leukocytes isolated from whole blood. An in house fluorimetric method was used to determine the activity of an enzyme palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 in leukocytes isolated from EDTA whole blood. This method has proven to be sufficiently reliable for use in selective laboratory diagnostics after clinical suspicion of CLN1 has been established. However, as the fluorimetric method itself has many limitations and drawbacks, it is recommended that the first method of screening is the method of measuring PPT 1 activity from a dry drop of blood sample on filter paper.",

Dementia may develop insidiously several years after manifestation of Parkinson motor symptoms (dementia associated with Parkinson's disease; Parkinson's disease dementia) or in close temporal relationship (within one year) after onset of motor symptoms (Dementia with Lewy bodies). There are clinical, pathophysiological and therapeutic similarities between these two conditions. Men are more frequently affected than women. Risk factor or indicators are advanced age at disease onset, disease duration, rigidity, akinesia and posture and gait impairment and falls as opposed to tremor dominance, and associated neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, apathy, hallucinosis, delirium). Dementia is treatable with cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, donepezil), memantine, and adjustment of the pharmacological regimen of parkinsonian motor symptoms. Concomitant autonomic nervous system symptoms and neuropsychiatric complications warrant early clinical awareness and are accessible to pharmacological therapy.",

Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

Background slowing without slow-wave intrusion is seen with acute and chronic cortical impairments that spare subcortical white matter. Subcortical/white matter structural abnormalities or hydrocephalus may produce projected slow-wave activity, while clinical entities involving both cortical and subcortical regions (diffuse cerebral abnormalities) engender both background slowing and slow-wave activity. Triphasic waves are seen with hepatic and renal insufficiency or medication toxicities (e.g., lithium, baclofen) in the absence of a significant cerebral imaging abnormality, Conversely, subcortical/white matter abnormalities may facilitate the appearance of triphasic waves without significant hepatic, renal, or toxic comorbidities. More specific syndromes, such as Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, autoimmune limbic encephalitis, autoimmune corticosteroid-responsive encephalopathy with thyroid autoimmunity, sepsis-associated encephalopathy, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, have imaging/EEG changes that are variable but which may include slowing and epileptiform activity. This overview highlighting EEG-imaging correlations may help the treating physician in the diagnosis, and hence the appropriate treatment, of patients with encephalopathy.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "title": "Depression: some proposals for future research.",
      "abstract": "The argument has been advanced that pathological states of anxiety and mania are both characterized by a failure on the part of the patient to attach appropriate levels of significance to changes occurring in the immediate environment. There is, it is suggested, a tendency for environmental features to be regarded as important even though, viewed objectively, they may have little relevance to the patient and his needs. Depression, it is further proposed, may be viewed as an extreme defense reaction to the intense anxiety which results from attaching too much significance to environmental events. In depressive state, patients are often characterised by their lowered responsiveness to stimulation and their lack of interest in, or concern about, their surroundings: it may be that, in such state, information processing has been blocked or reduced. The daytime drowsiness of the depressed patients, as well as his night-time sleep disturbance and the frequently observed recurrent or cyclic nature of certain kinds of depressed state, suggest that this blocking of sensory processing may be brought about by the involuntary intervention of mechanisms responsible, under normal circumstances, for sleep induction. This view of the nature of depression has been recast into the form of five potentially testable hypotheses. Speculation is always easy; providing convincing demonstrations that those speculations are reasonable is less easy. It is in the nature of psychological investigation that laboratory-based studies distort and may even destroy the phenomena about which information is sought, and many a perfectly reasonable theory has foundered upon the rocks of translation into experimental terms. In those areas of psychology which have implications for psychiatry and the conceptualisation of psychopathological states, this danger is particularly evident: psychiatric syndromes are complex, variable, and have social referrents, but laboratory experiments are limited in their capacity to reflect all these attributes, and consequently they may never provide really adequate tests of a theory about a psychiatric state. We have to try to come to terms with this apparent impasse--in the first place by being circumspect in translating psychiatric concepts into experimental terms, and secondly by exercising caution in interpreting the results to which the experiments give rise. More importantly, however, we have to accept the essential inadequacy of the majority of experimental paradigms in psychiatric research and to regard theorizing--even when it is not linked to explicitly testable hypotheses--as having inherent value.",

      "title": "P2‐432: Who refuses diagnostic assessment for dementia?",
      "abstract": "Dementia is a chronic, progressive and eventually fatal disorder characterized by cognitive decline in memory and at least one other cognitive domain such as language, visuo-spatial, or executive function. Presently, dementia is under recognized in the primary care of older adults. Screening for dementia in primary care increases recognition and treatment of reversible causes of memory loss and may delay of disease progression. In addition, earlier identification of dementia through screening may improve the diagnostic process and provide opportunities for physicians to discuss prognosis, learn about patient's goals, and tailor prevention and disease management targets and may improve patient and family outcomes such as knowledge about dementia, preparedness for future medical decisions, and confidence in medical decision-making. Once patients screen positive, they may delay or decline a diagnostic assessment for dementia due to concerns about having others know about their cognitive status, the belief that dementia cannot be treated or a general negative attitude toward medical assessment. In addition, previous studies have found that despite a caregiver recognizing more benefits from diagnostic assessment, 70.3% had a hard time accepting their family member's cognitive decline and 67.7% were concerned with how the diagnosis would impact their own life. In an effort to design patient-centered interventions to increase screening and diagnostic assessments, it is important to understand and enumerate the behaviors regarding diagnostic assessment. The purpose of this cross-sectional survey study is to determine the characteristics and perceptions of patients who completed the Perceptions Regarding Investigational Screening for Memory in Primary Care (PRISM-PC) Questionnaire and screened positive for dementia but subsequently refused further diagnostic assessment for dementia compared to those who screened positive and agreed to a diagnostic assessment. Cross- sectional survey of 554 primary care patients 65 years old and older without a diagnosis of dementia attending urban primary care clinics in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 2008-2009. Perceptions of dementia screening were measured with the Perceptions Regarding Investigational Screening for Memory in Primary Care (PRISM-PC) instrument. The PRISM-PC includes scales for benefits, stigma, independence, and suffering which are scored from 0 (strongly disagree on all items) to 100 (strongly agree on all items) with 50 as a neutral score. Refusing diagnostic assessment for dementia was determined by the percentage of patients who screened positive on at least one of two written screening instruments MMSE or CSI-D) but subsequently refused a diagnostic assessment at a specialty clinic. Associations were assessed between scores on the PRISM-PC questionnaire, screening performance, and behavior regarding diagnostic assessment for those with a positive screen. 497 individuals completed the PRISM-PC and agreed to dementia screening. Of those who agreed to screening, 63 (12.6%) screened positive. Among the 63 participants who screened positive, 21 (33.3%) accepted diagnostic assessment and 42 (66.6%) refused diagnostic assessment. Those who accepted diagnostic assessment did not differ in age, race, sex, education or income compared to those who refused diagnostic assessment. Individuals who refused diagnostic assessment following a positive screening test were more likely to live alone (p = 0.008). A bivariate comparison of the mean PRISM-PC scores of participants who accepted a diagnostic assessment and participants who refused it (Table 1) showed that there was a significant difference in the domain score for stigma of dementia screening (35.2 vs. 42.0; P = .045) but not in the domain scores for the benefits of dementia screening, the negative impact of dementia screening on independence, and the suffering related to dementia screening. There were also significant differences regarding the individual item that asked about agreement to be tested for Alzheimer's disease with a short questionnaire (3.9 vs. 3.5; P=023). In order to improve acceptance of diagnostic assessments for dementia, development of a decision aid that describes the components of what a diagnostic assessment entails as well as emphasizing potential benefits of early identification and acknowledgment of the perceived stigmata of having a dementia diagnosis may reduce patient reluctance to undergo a diagnostics assessment for dementia.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a multisystem alpha-synucleinopathic neurodegenerative disease and the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease with a high incidence rate in the elderly population. PD is highly multifactorial in etiology and has complex and wide-ranging pathogenic mechanisms. Environmental exposures and genetic predisposition are prominent risk factors. However, current evidence suggests that an intimate link may exist between the risk factor of sleep disturbance and PD pathogenesis. PD is characterized by the pathological hallmarks of alpha-synuclein aggregations and dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra. The loss of dopamine-producing neurons results in both motor and non-motor symptoms, most commonly, bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, psychiatric disorders, sleep disorders and gastrointestinal problems. Factors that may exacerbate alpha-synuclein accumulation and dopamine neuron loss include neuroinflammation and glymphatic system impairment. Extracellular alpha-synuclein can induce an inflammatory response which can lead to neural cell death and inhibition of neurogenesis. The glymphatic system functions most optimally to remove extracellular brain solutes during sleep and therefore sleep disruption may be a crucial progression factor as well as a risk factor. This literature review interprets and analyses data from experimental and epidemiological studies to determine the recent advances in establishing a relationship between glymphatic system dysfunction, sleep disturbance, and PD pathogenesis and progression. This review addresses current limitations surrounding the ability to affirm a causal link between improved glymphatic clearance by increased sleep quality in PD prevention and management. Furthermore, this review proposes potential therapeutic approaches that could utilize the protective mechanism of sleep, to promote glymphatic clearance that therefore may reduce disease progression as well as symptom severity in PD patients.",

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "title": "Local Field Potential Biomarkers of Non‐Motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease: Insights From the Subthalamic Nucleus in Deep Brain Stimulation",
      "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms can severely affect the quality of life of Parkinson's disease-afflicted patients, with the most common ones being pain, sleep impairments, and neuropsychiatric manifestations. In advanced cases, complex fluctuations of motor and non-motor symptoms can occur despite optimal medication. Research on deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus suggests that it may provide benefits for treating non-motor symptoms in addition to improving motor symptoms. With recent advancements in deep brain stimulation technology, simultaneous recording of local field potentials and delivery of therapeutic stimulation is possible. This opens new possibilities for better understanding the pathophysiology of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease and for identifying potential electrophysiological biomarkers that accurately represent these symptoms. Specifically, this review aims to highlight potential local field potential biomarkers of non-motor symptoms in the subthalamic nucleus. The main findings indicate that activities in the beta frequency band are associated with nociception and sleep impairments such as insomnia and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. Additionally, activities in the theta and alpha frequency bands seem to reflect neurocognitive manifestations, including depression and impulse control disorders. A better understanding of these biomarkers could improve the clinical management of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. They hold promise for adjusting deep brain stimulation parameters in open-loop settings and might eventually be applied in closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems, though their true impact remains uncertain.",

A young female patient presented with a neurological and visual disturbance which included variable symptoms like visual disturbances, headache, seizures and altered consciousness or mental status with a history of postpartum eclampsia after an uneventful LUCS. She also gave a history of a two-bag blood transfusion one month ago. A neurological and ophthalmic evaluation was performed. Detailed history taking and clinical evaluation followed by an imaging study, potentially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), helped to confirm the diagnosis of Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a clinico-neuroradiological disorder of neurotoxicity that typically involves headache, mental confusion, seizures, and occasionally loss of vision. The exact pathophysiology of PRES is still unclear and has not been thoroughly explained. Hypertension and endothelial cell injury may be pathognomic. Prompt management may help to recover early.",

      "title": "NKX6-2-Related Disorder",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics NKX6-2-related disorder is characterized by a spectrum of progressive neurologic manifestations resulting from diffuse central nervous system hypomyelination. At the severe end of the spectrum is neonatal-onset nystagmus, severe spastic tetraplegia with joint contractures and scoliosis, and visual and hearing impairment, all of which rapidly progress resulting in death in early childhood. At the milder end of the spectrum is normal achievement of early motor milestones in the first year of life followed by slowly progressive complex spastic ataxia with pyramidal findings (spasticity with increased muscle tone and difficulty with gait and fine motor coordination) and cerebellar findings (nystagmus, extraocular movement disorder, dysarthria, titubation, and ataxia) with loss of developmental milestones. To date NKX6-2-related disorder has been reported in 25 individuals from 13 families. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of NKX6-2-related disorder is established in a proband with typical clinical and neuroimaging findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in NKX6-2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and typically involves a multidisciplinary team of specialists in the areas of developmental pediatrics, neurology, pediatric rehabilitation, orthopedics, PT/OT, social work, nutrition, pulmonary/sleep medicine, ophthalmology, audiology, and palliative care. Surveillance: Sleep studies for evidence of apnea. Routine assessment of: nutritional status and safety of oral intake; development; progression of spasticity and contractures. Genetic counseling NKX6-2-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the NKX6-2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Factors Affecting Sleep and Wakefulness in People with Epilepsy: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "The importance of sleep has been reported for decades. Epilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder comprising multiple elements that might influence sleep and wakefulness. Notably, animal studies show disruptions of the circadian molecular system in different models of epilepsy, along with altered rest-activity and other circadian rhythms. So far, studies of molecular circadian systems in people with epilepsy are lacking, prompting further research. Seizures-the primary and most debilitating symptom of epilepsy-and interictal activity disrupt regular sleep and sleep-wake rhythms. Alterations in one's sleep structure are seen in both drug-naïve and drug-resistant patients with epilepsy. In particular, low sleep efficiency, a reduction in total sleep time, and changes in sleep stages were found in both homogenous and mixed samples of epilepsy patients. Both ictal and interictal activity were also shown to be associated with changes in peripheral circadian phase biomarkers such as melatonin and cortisol. Moreover, epilepsy comorbidities, antiseizure medications, and a variety of syndromes can be a cause of sleep problems or even sleep disorders. Sleep disorders vary depending on various comorbidities and syndromes, and encompass all major groups of sleep disorders defined in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Controversial findings on the effects of various antiseizure medications were found in the literature. However, medications such as benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, and barbiturates are particularly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Overall, a sleep evaluation must be included in the management of every patient with epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Nonrapid eye movement (NREM) or arousal parasomnias are prevalent conditions in children and young adults, apparently provoked by any medical, physical, mental, or pharmacologic/toxic agent disturbing normal biorhythm and causing sleep fragmentation or abundant amount of slow wave sleep. The nadir and the ascending slope of the first sleep cycle of night sleep are the typical periods when NREM parasomnias, especially sleepwalking may occur on sleep-microstructural level; microarousals are the typical moments allowing NREM parasomnias. While sleep-disturbing factors have a clear precipitating effect, a genetic predisposition appears necessary in most cases. A candidate gene for sleepwalking has been identified on chromosome 20q12-q13.12 in one sleepwalking family. NREM parasomnias have a genetic and clinical link with nocturnal-frontal lobe epilepsies; possibly through an abnormality of the acetylcholine-related sleep-control system. The association of NREM parasomnias with the human leukocyte antigen system might be the sign of an autoimmune background to be further clarified. In the treatment of arousal parasomnias, the main tools are adequate sleep hygiene and the management of underlying conditions. Their pharmacotherapy has remained unresolved; the best options are clonazepam and some of the antidepressants, while a psychotherapy approach is also justified.

      "abstract": "Three major components have been repeatedly implicated for the origin(s) of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): system, minor sickness and surroundings. All these factors also frame infant temperament, and therefore it seems logical to suppose that the babies who either succumb to or are at risk of SIDS may present with certain behavioural features. The infants who have died of SIDS moved less when lying awake in the crib, during feeding and during nail cutting; less often turned their head away and looked for their mother when held by a new person; were more frequently reported to show an extreme response (either almost never protested or almost always objected) when approached by someone other than main caregiver; and exhibited extreme behavioural patterns when the infant’s vocalising on waking up was studied. The infants who died of SIDS had lower activity scores. An unfavourable microenvironment can increase the risk of SIDS, and the babies facing less developmental stimulation had a more negative mood and were less distractible; less organised infants presented with a more negative mood, less distractible behaviour, lower rhythmicity, lower persistence and lower adaptability. The infants born to smoking mothers who are at risk of SIDS had more intensive reactions. The low‐birth‐weight infants who are at high risk of SIDS were more withdrawing and less adaptable. Infant–parent(s) bed sharing may increase the risk of SIDS, and solitary sleeping infants had a more positive mood and were more persistent. Use of a pacifier may be protective against SIDS, and pacifier users presented with higher rhythmicity. Prone sleep is known to increase the risk of SIDS, and the lowest persistence was a feature of those babies who were usually put to sleep supine and found prone. Infants who snored and/or had noisy breathing in sleep were characterised by more negative mood. Infants with signs of repetitive regurgitation were less distractible.",

      "title": "Basal Ganglia Disease And Depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases of the basal ganglia are quintessential neuropsychiatric disorders, characterized by abnormal movements, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms and signs. Depression is common in these illnesses and may occur at presentation or during the course of the illness. Individuals may present to the psychiatrist before seeing a neurologist. Depression is an important target for research, as it affords a unique perspective on the pathophysiology of basal ganglia diseases as well as an alternative method of understanding the biology of mood disorders. Traditionally, basal ganglia diseases are diagnosed and treated by neurologists, who define their onset by specific motor manifestations. Psychiatric symptomatology has been considered peripheral to the understanding of the motor disorders that define basal ganglia diseases. There is growing evidence for the contrary view that mood and affect are integrally related to the evolution of these diseases. For example, in diseases such as Huntington’s disease or Wilson’s disease, where the genetic mutation has been identified, it is possible to identify presymptomatic individuals, prior to the development of motor signs, who are unaware of their genetic status, and determine whether cognitive or psychiatric manifestations occur more often in gene-positive than in genenegative individuals. Another way to examine the role of psychiatric impairment is to study individuals in the general population who have undergone psychiatric assessments and to determine if individuals with a history of affective disorder are more likely to develop specific basal ganglia diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) than individuals without mood disorders. This chapter includes a review of the epidemiology, prevalence, and correlates of depression in basal ganglia diseases and their treatment.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders share not only clinical features but also some risk factors such as genetic markers and childhood adversity, while other risk factors such as urbanicity and obstetric complications seem to be specific to schizophrenia. An intriguing question is whether the well-established abnormal neurodevelopment present in many children and adolescents who eventually develop schizophrenia is also present in bipolar patients. The literature on adult bipolar patients is controversial. We report data on a subgroup of patients with pediatric-onset psychotic bipolar disorder who seem to share some developmental trajectories with patients with early-onset schizophrenia. These early-onset psychotic bipolar patients have low intelligence quotient, more neurological signs, reduced frontal gray matter at the time of their first psychotic episode, and greater brain changes than healthy controls in a pattern similar to early-onset schizophrenia cases. However, patients with early-onset schizophrenia seem to have more social impairment, developmental abnormalities (eg, language problems), and lower academic achievement in childhood than early-onset bipolar patients. We suggest that some of these abnormal developmental trajectories are more related to the phenotypic features (eg, early-onset psychotic symptoms) of these 2 syndromes than to categorically defined Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders disorders.",

      "abstract": "The visual system has high metabolic requirements and is therefore particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction. The most commonly affected tissues include the extraocular muscles, photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium, optic nerve and visual cortex. Hence, the most common manifestations of mitochondrial disorders are progressive external ophthalmoplegia, macular pattern dystrophy, pigmentary retinopathy, optic neuropathy and retrochiasmal visual field loss. With the exception of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and stroke-like episodes seen in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes, the majority of neuro-ophthalmic manifestations have an insidious onset. As such, some patients may not recognize subtle progressive visual symptoms. When mitochondrial disorders are highly suspected, meticulous examination performed by an ophthalmologist with targeted ancillary testing can help confirm the diagnosis. Similarly, neuro-ophthalmic symptoms and signs may be the first indication of mitochondrial disease and should prompt systemic investigations for potentially life-threatening associations, such as cardiac conduction defects. Finally, the ophthalmologist can offer symptomatic treatments for some of the most disabling manifestations of these disorders.",

      "title": "Uremic neuropathy: Clinical features and new pathophysiological insights",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neuropathy is a common complication of end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD), typically presenting as a distal symmetrical process with greater lower‐limb than upper‐limb involvement. The condition is of insidious onset, progressing over months. and has been estimated to be present in 60%–100% of patients on dialysis. Neuropathy generally only develops at glomerular filtration rates of less than 12 ml/min. The most frequent clinical features reflect large‐fiber involvement, with paresthesias, reduction in deep tendon reflexes, impaired vibration sense, muscle wasting, and weakness. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate findings consistent with a generalized neuropathy of the axonal type. Patients may also develop autonomic features, with postural hypotension, impaired sweating, diarrhea, constipation, or impotence. The development of uremic neuropathy has been related previously to the retention of neurotoxic molecules in the middle molecular range, although this hypothesis lacked formal proof. Studies utilizing novel axonal excitability techniques have recently shed further light on the pathophysiology of this condition. Nerves of uremic patients have been shown to exist in a chronically depolarized state prior to dialysis, with subsequent improvement and normalization of resting membrane potential after dialysis. The degree of depolarization correlates with serum K + , suggesting that chronic hyperkalemic depolarization plays an important role in the development of nerve dysfunction in ESKD. These recent findings suggest that maintenance of serum K + within normal limits between periods of dialysis, rather than simple avoidance of hyperkalemia, is likely to reduce the incidence and severity of uremic neuropathy.

Beide Erkrankungen haben gemeinsame Symptome wie kognitive Einschränkungen und Veränderungen von Schlafstruktur und Qualität. Wenn sich die Demenz einmal manifestiert hat, können Schlafstörungen wie obstruktive Schlafapnoe, Restless-legs-Syndrom und Parasomnien die Symptomatik verstärken. Die Schlafstruktur zeigt eine Verminderung von langsamwelligem Schlaf und häufiges nächtliches Erwachen mit längeren Wachzeiten. Schlaf ermöglicht es, mittels Aktivierung des glymphatischen Systems Aß- und Tau-Proteine, die sich im Wachen angesammelt haben, aus dem ZNS auszuschleusen. Wegen der bidirektionalen Interaktionen ist es erforderlich, Schlafstörungen vermehrte Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken und sie früh zu diagnostizieren und zu behandeln, um einer Verschlimmerung einer existierenden oder sich entwickelnden Demenz vorzubeugen. Eine Anzahl von subjektiven Fragebögen und objektiven Instrumenten wie Polysomnografie und Aktigrafie stehen für die Diagnostik zur Verfügung. Begleitende Schlafstörungen sollten immer mit behandelt werden (z. B. nasale Überdrucktherapie bei Schlafapnoe). Prävention oder Behandlung sollten immer Verhaltenstherapien wie körperliche Aktivierung, soziale Interaktion und ausreichende Exposition gegenüber Tageslicht beinhalten. Einige Antidepressiva, Melatonin, neue duale Orexinrezeptorantagonisten (in Deutschland nicht zugelassen) und wenige Hypnotika können zur Behandlung empfohlen werden. Die Schlafprobleme der betreuenden Personen sollten in den Behandlungsablauf eingeschlossen werden, um die Lebensqualität der Erkrankten zu optimieren.",

      "abstract": "Children presenting with Developmental Coordination Disorder or clumsiness often exhibit signs of minor neurological dysfunction (MND). The data of the Groningen Perinatal Project, a long-term follow-up project on the relations between prenatal and perinatal adversities and neurological, behavioral, and cognitive development revealed that two basic forms of MND can be distinguished: simple and complex MND. During school age children with simple MND are characterized by the presence of one or two dysfunctional clusters of MND, in adolescence by the presence of choreiform dyskinesia or hypotonia. Probably the major sources of origin of simple MND are genetic constitution and stress during early life. Simple MND might reflect the lower tail of the normal distribution of the quality of non-pathological brain function. In line with this hypothesis is the finding that simple MND is associatedwith only a moderately increased risk for learning- and behavioral problems. Children with complex MND present at school age with at least three dysfunctional clusters of MND, in adolescence with problems in fine manipulation or coordination. Perinatal adversities play an evident etiological role in the development of complex MND, suggesting that it might be attributed to a lesion of the brain at early age. In line with this idea is the finding that complex MND shows a strong correlation with attention and learning problems.",

      "abstract": "Rolandic epilepsy or benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is called benign because its seizures are usually favourable and due to the spontaneous normalisation of the electroencephalogram on reaching puberty. Nevertheless, evidence has been found of the impact on cognitive development with the presence of heterogeneous cognitive deficits, especially related to persistent intercritical discharges during non-REM sleep. The aim of this study is to examine the epileptogenic networks involved in the neuropsychological disorders of this pathology.A common feature of the atypical developments is persistent epileptic activity during slow sleep, which plays an important role in the development of the neurocognitive deficits that are associated to this pathology. Factors such as the age at onset of the epilepsy, the onset of the atypical development, the location of the interictal discharges and the continuous epileptic activity during sleep that persists for more than two years can trigger changes in the functioning of the neurocognitive networks. This may result in deficits in the neuropsychological functions, which may even be irreversible.A close clinical and electroencephalographic follow-up is necessary. Moreover, formal neuropsychological studies must be conducted as of the onset of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. This is even more necessary in cases in which there is an obvious atypical development in order to detect and prevent the neuropsychological deficits before they establish themselves on a definitive basis.Las alteraciones neuropsicologicas son frecuentes en la epilepsia rolandica y sus evoluciones atipicas.Introduccion. La epilepsia rolandica o epilepsia benigna de la infancia con puntas centrotemporales se denomina benigna debido a lo favorables que suelen ser sus crisis y a la espontanea normalizacion del electroencefalograma al llegar a la pubertad, aunque se ha demostrado el impacto sobre el desarrollo cognitivo con la presencia de deficits cognitivos heterogeneos, relacionados especialmente con las descargas intercriticas persistentes durante el sueño no REM. El objetivo de este trabajo es estudiar las redes epileptogenas involucradas en los trastornos neuropsicologicos de esta patologia. Desarrollo. Las evoluciones atipicas tienen en comun una actividad epileptica persistente durante el sueño lento, que desempeña un papel importante en el desarrollo de los deficits neurocognitivos que se asocian a esta patologia. Factores como la edad de inicio de la epilepsia, el inicio de la evolucion atipica, la localizacion de las descargas interictales y la actividad epileptica continua durante el sueño que persista durante mas de dos años pueden provocar cambios en el funcionamiento de las redes neurocognitivas, con los consecuentes deficits en las funciones neuropsicologicas, que incluso pueden resultar irreversibles. Conclusiones. Es necesario un seguimiento cercano tanto clinico como electroencefalografico; ademas, deben realizarse estudios neuropsicologicos formales desde el inicio de la epilepsia benigna de la infancia con puntas centrotemporales y mas en los casos que es evidente una evolucion atipica para detectar y prevenir los deficits neuropsicologicos antes de que se instauren definitivamente.",

      "title": "Young-Onset Dementia and Neurodegenerative Disorders of the Young With an Emphasis on Clinical Manifestations",
      "abstract": "Young-onset dementia (YOD) refers to a neurological ailment primarily affecting people below 65 years of age in roughly about 8% of cases found through various researches. The high rate of prevalence of secondary dementias among older patients proves that younger people show a better prognosis of the conditions causing dementia than older people. However, effective interventions have to be usually provided early in the course of cognitive decline to help facilitate cognitive improvement. The risk of development of prodromal dementia is high if there is a development of psychoses in middle-aged or older people. When there is a development of psychoses in middle to late life, the likelihood of this indicates prodromal dementia is high. The clinical presentation is quite variable and often subtle in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) but may be dominated by personality change, behavioral disturbances, motivation, or the loss of empathy. There is great heterogeneity in the probable causes of dementia in young age as compared to dementia in old age, and some observed differences also exist in the course and characteristics of the disease. These causes may range from the most probable cause such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) to causes with low probability, such as metabolic disorders and prion diseases. The symptoms of young-onset dementia include a gradual development of personality and behavioral changes over a period of years. However, in the initial stages of young-onset dementia, this change can be attributed to various issues, such as depression, marital problems, and menopause. Other neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease show presentations such as changes in personality, chorea, and depression that can be observed in patients in their early adulthood. A few other neurodegenerative disorders are myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) and mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) with presentations such as characterized muscle weakness, poor growth, problems with vision and hearing, and the involvement of the multi-organ system, including the central nervous system to name a few. There is also the prevalence of juvenile parkinsonism in the community, which represents a group of clinicopathological entities present before the age of 21. Young-onset Parkinson's disease (PD) (YOPD) appears to have the same pathological presentation as late-onset Parkinson's disease (LOPD). Recent researches have proved that \"gene therapy\" can be useful in the treatment and in preventing the progression of symptoms in cases of neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Análisis evolutivo y valoración neuropsicológica integral de pacientes con deterioro cognitivo leve o enfermedad de Alzheimer.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION \nEl envejecimiento de la poblacion esta causando un aumento en la aparicion de patologias asociadas a la edad, como es el caso de las demencias. Afortunadamente los avances de las Ciencias de la Salud como la Medicina, la Psicologia y, en particular, la Neuropsicologia estan aportando herramientas de gran utilidad para la evaluacion, el diagnostico y el tratamiento de procesos como el Deterioro Cognitivo Leve (DCL) y la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA).\nEl Deterioro Cognitivo Leve es definido como un sindrome clinico caracterizado por la alteracion adquirida en una o mas areas cognitivas (atencion, funciones ejecutivas, lenguaje, memoria o area visuoespacial) con una duracion de meses a anos, que sin cumplir los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia excede a lo esperado por la edad. La afectacion es referida por el propio paciente o por un informador y debe ser objetivada en la exploracion neuropsicologica, pudiendo provocar una interferencia minima en el desarrollo de las actividades habituales. El DCL es frecuentemente ubicado en un continuo que transcurre desde el envejecimiento normal hasta la enfermedad de Alzheimer, considerando a las personas con DCL como un grupo poblacional con alto riesgo de padecer posteriormente demencia (predominantemente Enfermedad de Alzheimer).\nLa Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) ha sido la demencia mas estudiada y aunque su evolucion es heterogenea, la afectacion cognoscitiva mas grave en los primeros estadios es la alteracion de la memoria. La EA se caracteriza por un comienzo insidioso, dificultando la discriminacion y la realizacion de un diagnostico temprano. Conforme avanza la enfermedad otras areas cognitivas se ven gravemente afectadas.\n Por tanto, la definicion del perfil clinico y neuropsicologico asociado a las primeras etapas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es crucial para facilitar la deteccion temprana de la enfermedad, establecer el punto de partida para una intervencion adecuada y poder llevar a cabo un seguimiento de la evolucion de manera controlada.\nOBJETIVO\nEn la presente Tesis Doctoral se analiza el perfil neuropsicologico integral y el curso evolutivo de pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve y Enfermedad de Alzheimer en dos estadios, leve y moderado, atendiendo a la capacidad funcional y cognitiva en tres momentos diferentes de su evolucion, al inicio y a los seis y doce meses.\nMATERIAL Y METODOS\nSe han llevado a cabo cinco estudios basados en una metodologia descriptiva transversal (Estudios I-IV) y longitudinal (Estudio V), mediante la exploracion neuropsicologica integral y clinica de una muestra inicial de 116 pacientes de los cuales 72 se han ajustado a los criterios de inclusion en la fase de valoracion basal y 44 en la fase de evolucion. El protocolo de evaluacion ha estado conformado por los siguientes tests de screening, de funcionalidad y de dominio cognitivo especifico: Examen Cognoscitivo MiniMental, Test de los 7 Minutos, Escala de Deterioro Global (GDS), Escala para las Actividades Basicas de la Vida diaria BARTHEL, Escala de sobrecarga del cuidador de ZARIT, Cuestionario de Actividad Funcional (FAQ) de Pfeiffer y diferentes subtests del Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica-Test Barcelona.\nRESULTADOS\nA nivel funcional, el grupo con DCL inicialmente era independiente en el desarrollo de las ABVDs pero conforme ha transcurrido el tiempo han comenzado a requerir cierta supervision en sus actividades. A nivel cognitivo inicialmente han presentado afectacion principal de las funciones ejecutivas, la memoria diferida y la velocidad de procesamiento, manteniendo preservadas a los doce meses de investigacion el resto de las funciones evaluadas aunque con un descenso en la ejecucion a los seis meses en orientacion temporal y fluencia verbal.\nLos pacientes con EAL han presentado dependencia funcional desde el inicio incrementada a los doce meses. A nivel cognitivo, en la valoracion inicial se han encontrado resultados sugerentes de afectacion en las funciones ejecutivas (planificacion y secuenciacion), memoria verbal (inmediata y diferida) y velocidad de procesamiento. A los seis meses han comenzado a verse afectadas las funciones de span atencional, coordinacion motora, denominacion y comprension lectora y a los doce meses la orientacion temporal tambien se ha visto afectada. Los sujetos han preservado algunas funciones como la orientacion espacial, lenguaje (automatico, repeticion de palabras, comprension auditiva), praxias ideomotoras y abstraccion verbal.\nPor ultimo, los sujetos con EAM han mostrado alteracion funcional inicial y afectacion de casi todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas (orientacion temporal y espacial, abstraccion, planificacion y secuenciacion, control mental, span atencional, repeticion de material verbal extenso, fluencia verbal semantica y fonetica, comprension verbal auditiva y lectora, praxias ideomotoras, memoria y velocidad de procesamiento). A los seis meses se ha afectado tambien la orientacion en persona y la denominacion de imagenes. En la ultima evaluacion todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas han estado afectadas a excepcion de la capacidad para repetir palabras conocidas y logatomos y para emitir series automaticas del lenguaje cuando son requeridas en orden directo.\nCONCLUSION\nLos sujetos con DCL han comenzado a presentar alteraciones clinicas que les conducen a sentir limitaciones clinicas considerables y que son percibidas por el propio paciente y por las personas de su entorno. En el caso de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer, la evolucion de la misma termina por causar afectacion de todas las funciones mentales superiores y conduce al paciente a un estado de dependencia donde requieren una ayuda continua cada dia. Ademas las areas que en estadios mas temprano comienzan a alterarse son las que se han observado dramaticamente mas afectadas en estadios mas avanzados (memoria, funciones ejecutivas y velocidad de procesamiento).\nLa evaluacion realizada en esta investigacion ha contibuido a la definicion del perfil neuropsicologico de los pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer en estadio leve y moderado, facilitando la labor de discriminar la afectacion funcional y cognitiva inicial en los tres grupos de estudio.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer, Perfil Neuropsicologico, Evaluacion Neuropsicologica",

      "title": "Cockayne Syndrome in Adults: Review With Clinical and Pathologic Study of a New Case",
      "abstract": "Cockayne syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum—Cockayne syndrome complex are rare autosomal recessive disorders with poorly understood biology. They are characterized by profound postnatal brain and somatic growth failure and by degeneration of multiple tissues resulting in cachexia, dementia, and premature aging. They result in premature death, usually in childhood, exceptionally in adults. This study compares the clinical course and pathology of a man with Cockayne syndrome group A who died at age 31½ years with 15 adequately documented other adults with Cockayne syndrome and 5 with xeroderma pigmentosum—Cockayne syndrome complex. Slowing of head and somatic growth was apparent before age 2 years, mental retardation and slowly progressive spasticity at 4 years, ataxia and hearing loss at 9 years, visual impairment at 14 years, typical Cockayne facies at 17 years, and cachexia and dementia in his twenties, with a retained outgoing personality. He experienced several transient right and left hemipareses and two episodes of status epilepticus following falls. Neuropathology disclosed profound microencephaly, bilateral old subdural hematomas, white-matter atrophy, tigroid leukodystrophy with string vessels, oligodendrocyte proliferation, bizarre reactive astrocytes, multifocal dystrophic calcification that was most marked in the basal ganglia, advanced atherosclerosis, mixed demyelinating and axonal neuropathy, and neurogenic muscular atrophy. Cellular degeneration of the organ of Corti, spiral and vestibular ganglia, and all chambers of the eye was severe. Rarely, and for unexplained reasons, in some patients with Cockayne syndrome the course is slower than usual, resulting in survival into adulthood. The profound dwarfing, failure of brain growth, cachexia, selectivity of tissue degeneration, and poor correlation between genotypes and phenotypes are not understood. Deficient repair of DNA can increase vulnerability to oxidative stress and play a role in the premature aging, but why patients with mutations in xeroderma pigmentosum genes present with the Cockayne syndrome phenotype is still not known.

      "abstract": "he cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders, characterised by symptoms and signs of cerebellar degeneration, pyramidal and extrapyramidal features, and variable polyneuropathy. Prominent clinical features are signs of cerebellar ataxia, such as uncoordinated gait and uncontrolled co-ordination of hand, speech, and eye movements, while (extra) pyramidal signs, such as retinal, cardiac, muscle and/or neuronal involvement, are less common. The clinical picture shows a large variation in age at onset and disease progression. Sporadic ataxias may be attributed to various toxic, inflammatory, paraneoplastic, metabolic, endocrinal, or malabsorption conditions. Hereditary ataxias consist of a large number of autosomal dominant ataxias and ataxias with an autosomal recessive and X-linked mode of inheritance. The remaining ataxias of unknown cause are referred to as idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxias. Most symptomatic ataxias can be diagnosed on the basis of a typical history or by simple laboratory tests. In hereditary ataxias family history is important. However, a negative family history cannot rule out autosomal recessive or X-linked ataxia and even autosomal dominantly inherited ataxia may be missed because of reduced penetrance, the early death of gene carriers before the onset of symptoms, imprinting effects, variable expression, adoption, or nonpaternity. 1",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease capable of both directly and indirectly affecting both the central nervous system and other anatomical divisions. SLE’s etiology is unknown and generally understood as multifactorial in nature, and the disease can present with a wide range of symptoms and comorbid conditions of varying severity. Although the list of documented neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive dysfunctions associated with SLE continues to grow, established correlates include headache, seizure, stroke, and cognitive impairments such as memory loss. Method The current case is a 26-year-old, right-handed, African American female with childhood-onset SLE with multi-organ involvement. SLE manifestations and complications have included neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE), lupus nephritis (LN), rheumatoid pericarditis (RA), vasculitis, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), among others. Past neuropsychological testing was conducted to determine whether this patient was experiencing cognitive deficits associated with NPSLE (2019) and past leukemia treatment (2022). Her 2019 neuropsychological testing revealed subtle neurocognitive deficits, and her 2022 testing revealed mild to moderate neurocognitive deficits with some evidence of decline. Results This patient’s performance on the present neurocognitive battery suggests continued mild to moderate deficits in attention, immediate and working memory, cognitive processing speed, motor speed, and visuospatial perception and memory. This patient continues to report subjective worsening of her neurocognitive symptoms, especially in the areas of memory and attention as well as anxiety and depression. Conclusion This case explores neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive dysfunctions associated with SLE and comorbid conditions. Neuropsychological testing can help monitor these phenomena across the lifespan.",

      "abstract": "Muscle weakness has a multitude of causes. Some involve genetic or metabolic disturbances affecting the muscle directly, some are caused by interruptions to the transmission of impulses at the neuromuscular junction, still others by abnormalities in the muscle nerve supply. Disuse atrophy with profound weakness may be seen in advanced arthritis or in any other condition where chronic pain enforces immobility. There are numerous uncommon syndromes in which muscle weakness is an important component; many of these will come to a specialist neurologist for elucidation. Some weakness is temporary, recovery of strength often occurs in stroke or very commonly in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Cranial motor and peripheral muscular dysfunction in myasthenia gravis may respond to steroids, immuno-suppressants and either plasma exchange or immunoglobulin infusions as well as thymectomy and the use of pyridostigmine. There are presentations of ‘functional’ weakness (often unilateral and sometimes accompanied by sensory symptoms) commonly of prolonged duration, that are little altered by treatment of any kind, but are not readily assigned to any recognizable neurological diagnosis. This group of disorders reminds us that weakness is a subjective as well an objective and measurable symptom.",

      "abstract": "Virtually all members of the animal kingdom experience a relentless and powerful cycling of states of being: wakefulness, rapid eye movement sleep, and nonrapid eye movement sleep. Each of these states is composed of a number of physiologic variables generated in a variety of neural structures. The predictable oscillations of these states are driven by presumed neural pacemakers which are entrained to the 24 h geophysical environment by the light/dark cycle. Experiments in nature have indicated that wake/sleep rhythm perturbations may occur either involving desynchronization of the basic 24 h wake/sleep cycle within the geophysical 24 h cycle (circadian rhythm disturbances) or involving the rapid oscillation or incomplete declaration of state (such as narcolepsy). The use of phase spaces to describe states of being may be of interest in the description of state determination in both illness and health. Some fascinating clinical and experimental phenomena may represent bifurcations in the sleep/wake control system.",

It is often misdiagnosed as a psychosis, early dementia or a drug related condition. Hypoxemia was anecdotally reported as a cause of CBS. Objectives We present an older adult with CBS caused by severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Aims To report a case study, describing treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome as a cause of CBS. Methods A case study is presented and discussed. Results An older male adult was admitted to hospital for persistent vivid visual hallucinations. There was no personal or family history of mental illness. Neurological examination was normal, except for visual impairment due to age related macular degeneration. The remainder of his physical examination was normal. Previous treatment with antipsychotics proved not to be effective. Severe hypoxemia (SaO 2 79%) was diagnosed with overnight pulse oximetry and subsequent polysomnography revealed an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. After three nights of nasal continuous positive airway pressure, the vivid hallucinations ceased. Conclusion Physicians need to understand the underlying causes and mechanisms of CBS. One should be aware of the importance of a full clinical examination and sleep apnea research in elderly persons with visual impairment.

      "abstract": "<h3>ABSTRACT</h3> Delirium describes a sudden onset change in mental status of fluctuating course. This is a state of altered consciousness characterised chiefly by inattention or lack of arousal, but can also include new impairment of language, perception and behaviour.

Although the exact etiology of MDD is unclear, several underlying mechanisms (disturbances in immune response and/or stress response) have been associated with its development, with no single mechanism able to account for all aspects of the disorder. Currently, about 1 in 3 patients are resistant to current antidepressant therapies. Providing an alternative perspective on MDD could therefore pave the way for new, unexplored diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. The central nervous system harbors an enormous pool of lipids and lipid intermediates that have been linked to a plethora of its physiological functions. The aim of this review is therefore to provide an overview of the implications of lipids in MDD and highlight certain MDD-related underlying mechanisms that involve lipids and/or their intermediates. Furthermore, we will also focus on the bidirectional relationship between MDD and the lipid-related disorders obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The more important part of the assessment of any patient with dizziness or unsteadiness is the clinical history. Symptoms of vertigo, dizziness or unsteadiness can be present in diseases from many organs and systems so the doctor should not automatically equate dizziness with the inner ear. “True” or rotational vertigo implies involvement of the semicircular canals or their central connections, usually the brainstem or cerebellum. However, patients with fainting or syncope syndromes can describe transient rotational feelings as well. It is often the accompanying symptoms and presentation pattern that leads to a diagnosis. Some of the questions doctors should try to answer are: Is this a single, prolonged attack of vertigo, as in vestibular neuritis or brainstem stroke? Is this a recurrent vertiginous syndrome, as in vestibular migraine or Meniere’s disease? Are there any associated migraneous features like in the former or aural symptoms like in the latter? Are the symptoms provoked by lying down/turning over in bed, as in BPPV, or only occur whilst standing up as in postural hypotension? Are there any associated brainstem symptoms as in TIAs or demyelination? Is the patient chronic “dizziness” a progressive gait disorder? Carefully enquiring about the nature of the symptom (vertigo, dizziness, fainting sensation, unsteadiness), presentation (acute, recurrent, chronic, progressive), duration and triggers is vital in reaching a diagnosis.",

Visual suppression was impaired greatly in cerebellar patients, without correlation with visual smooth-pursuit defects. Acoustic suppression was equal to or slightly weaker than visual suppression. In noncerebellar patients, a disturbance of visual suppression was found only in the presence of a severe impairment of pursuit eye movements. Acoustic suppression did not parallel the visual-suppression pattern. In clinical vestibular examination, an impaired modulation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex suggests a cerebellar dysfunction, but also can occur in the presence of disorders of other parts of the CNS severely affecting the SP system.",

      "abstract": "Meige syndrome, a rare form of cranial dystonia, manifests as involuntary spasms affecting the facial and neck muscles. Diagnosing Meige syndrome is challenging due to its similarities with various movement disorders and psychiatric conditions. Functional neurological disorder (FND) refers to a condition characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with recognized neurological or medical conditions. Symptoms may include motor or sensory disturbances such as weakness, tremors, paralysis, or seizures. Importantly, these symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition or by the direct effects of a substance. Instead, they are believed to stem from psychological factors. This case demonstrates the diagnostic dilemma of Meige syndrome. It was initially misdiagnosed as a functional neurological disorder in a 42-year-old female. The difficulties in differentiating between these disorders highlight the necessity of a thorough evaluation and increased clinical suspicion in cases of movement disorders. For treatment outcomes to be optimized and to resolve patient distress, prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential.",

Sleep disorders and frequent non-motor manifestations are commonly comorbid with SCA. To elucidate this relationship, we present three cases in a family that included multiple SCA type 2 patients with various sleep disorders. Complete physical examination, and genetic and imaging studies were performed. Anti-parkinsonism medications were prescribed after neurological examination. Clonazepam and/or quetiapine were administered for sleep disorders but failed to resolve insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Based on DSM-5 criteria, all cases were diagnosed with depression. After treatment with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants, symptoms of insomnia and EDS, which are strongly associated with depression in SCA type 2 patients, improved significantly. It is crucial to recognize insomnia and EDS in neurodegenerative diseases, not only for earlier diagnosis, but also to improve quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic neuropathies (DN) are a heterogeneous group of disorders that include a wide range of abnormalities. They can be focal or diffuse, proximal or distal, affecting both peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, causing morbidity with significant impact on the quality of life of the person with diabetes, resulting in early mortality. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy, the most common form of DN, usually involves small and large nerve fibers. Small nerve fiber neuropathy often presents with pain without objective signs or electrophysiologic evidence of nerve damage. However, there are now measures enabling early recognition of this type of neuropathy as a component of the impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic syndromes. The greatest risk of small fiber neuropathy is foot ulceration and subsequent gangrene and amputation. Large nerve fiber neuropathies produce numbness, ataxia and incoordination, impairing activities of daily living and causing falls and fractures. A careful history and detailed physical examination is essential for the diagnosis. Symptomatic therapy has become available, and newer and better treatment modalities based on etiologic factors are being explored with potential for significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Preventive strategies and patient education still remain key factors in reducing complication rates and mortality. A number of mechanical measures for the treatment of neuropathy have been examined, and it is currently unclear whether or not these have salutary effects over and above those of placebo, and longer, well-controlled clinical trials are anticipated. In addition, there is the suggestion that surgical unentrapment of nerves in DN may confer symptomatic relief, but outside of clear applications in proven entrapments, this form of intervention has not been endorsed universally. We now have two drugs approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain in diabetes that is a first, and it remains to be seen whether the evidence-based approach will supersede the need for cost containment and the tried and tested approaches to pain management in the clinic. Finally, the American Diabetes Association have included somatic and autonomic guidelines in their 2006 issue of clinical recommendations, which has come as a welcome relief to the Cinderella of diabetic complications, DN.",

This syndrome is common among a number of neurological diseases like patients with a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as dementias such as Alzheimer;s disease (AD), and motor disorders such as Parkinson;s disease (PD).

      "abstract": "Partial or complete unawareness of deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may result in delaying diagnosis and difficulties for caring. Many theories have been proposed to explain unawareness of neurological or cognitive deficits. Neurological theories use the term of anosognosia to describe unawareness as a consequence of the severity and location of brain lesions. They predict an association between the unawareness of deficits in AD and the severity of dementia or location of the lesions in the right cerebral hemisphere or in the frontal regions. More recent theories have been based on models derived from cognitive neuropsychology. Some models have been designed to explain unawareness of specific deficits such as the memory disorders, others are more extensive based on models of consciousness of the Self. Psychopathological theories postulate that unawareness of deficits is the consequence of a psychological defense mechanism, termed denial. Therefore, unawareness of deficits in AD should be linked to the premorbid personality, abilities to cope with the disease and its consequences more than to the severity and location of brain lesions. The validity of each theory is discussed according to the data from the literature. However, the analysis of the literature is clouded by many methodological difficulties due to the variability of terminology and tools used to assess the unawareness. Moreover, most studies were too narrowly focused on specific points, not taking into account a global model of insight. Nevertheless, some conclusions can be drawn from the available data: 1) the nature of the unawareness of deficits in AD is multidimensional. Terms such anosognosia or denial do not describe single phenomena but correspond to disturbances of various neurological, neuropsychological and psychopathological mechanisms, which can not be explained by a single theory; 2) unawareness should no more be considered as a category but according to a dimensional approach. There is a wide range of levels of unawareness, which can vary from one moment to an other and during the progression of the disease; 3) neurological, neuropsychological and psychopathological mechanisms implicated in unawareness probably coexist in various degrees depending, on one hand, on the disease severity and type of deficits and, on the other hand, on the history and personality of the patient, his(her) familial support, but also on the social perception of the disease. To improve our understanding of the unawareness of deficits in AD, we propose to come back to a detailed clinical description investigating extensively the various aspects of insight.",

The term is misleading, for it suggests that this diathesis is confined solely to the mentally afflicted, and, further, its precise meaning is vague. A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

      "title": "Restless Legs Syndrome as the Initial Presentation of Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common central nervous system disorder. It is characterized by complaints of unpleasant sensation in the legs occurring during periods of leg inactivity which worsen or only occur in the evening or at night and relieved partially or totally by movement. The RLS may be idiopathic or due to secondary causes. It is associated with several pathological or physiological conditions. Iron metabolism and dysfunctions of the dopaminergic system are the most important factors in the pathophysiology. There are several studies suggesting multiple sclerosis as one of the causes of symptomatic RLS. Here, we report a case of RLS as the initial presentation of MS. The sudden onset of RLS symptoms in our patient suggested the possibility of an underlying cause. His diagnostic evaluation excluded other causes of RLS and his clinical course suggested that RLS was due to MS. MS with the spinal cord involvement is mostly associated with RLS, but any lesion in the hypothalamic-spinal connection may cause disinhibition of lower spinal levels, resulting in RLS. RLS as the initial presentation of MS reflects that the pathophysiology of RLS in MS is related to inflammatory demyelination rather than axonal degeneration.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics TBC1D24-related disorders comprise a continuum of features that were originally described as distinct, recognized phenotypes: DOORS syndrome (deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation, and seizures). Profound sensorineural hearing loss, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, intellectual disability / developmental delay, and seizures Familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy (FIME). Early-onset myoclonic seizures, focal epilepsy, dysarthria, and mild-to-moderate intellectual disability Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME). Action myoclonus, tonic-clonic seizures, progressive neurologic decline, and ataxia Early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy 16 (EIEE16). Epileptiform EEG abnormalities which themselves are believed to contribute to progressive disturbance in cerebral function Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, DFNB86. Profound prelingual deafness Autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, DFNA65. Slowly progressive deafness with onset in the third decade, initially affecting the high frequencies Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a TBC1D24-related disorder is established in an individual with biallelic TBC1D24 pathogenic variants when the mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive (i.e., DOORS syndrome, FIME, PME, EIEE16, and DFNB86), and in an individual with a heterozygous TBC1D24 pathogenic variant when the mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant (DFNA65). Management Treatment of manifestations: Hearing aids or cochlear implants as needed for hearing loss; early educational intervention and physical, occupational, and speech therapy for developmental delay; symptomatic pharmacologic management for seizures; routine management of visual impairment and renal and cardiac anomalies. Surveillance: Neurology evaluations with EEGs depending on seizure frequency and/or progression of clinical manifestations; yearly audiologic evaluation to assess for possible progression of hearing loss and/or the efficacy of hearing aids; yearly dental evaluation. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Excessive ambient noise, which may exacerbate hearing loss in heterozygotes for a TBC1D24 pathogenic variant that causes DFNA65. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing for the familial TBC1D24 pathogenic variant(s) in older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment of seizures and/or hearing loss. Genetic counseling Most TBC1D24-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (DOORS syndrome, FIME, PME, EIEE16, and DFNB86). For autosomal recessive inheritance: At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives requires prior identification of the TBC1D24 pathogenic variants in the family. Prenatal testing is possible for pregnancies at increased risk if the TBC1D24 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member.",

Epilepsy is thus best considered a symptom of an underlying brain disorder. A single seizure is not usually considered sufficient to make a diagnosis of epilepsy.

Partial seizures arise from a localized region of cerebral cortex. The clinical manifestations of a partial seizure depend on where in the cortex it begins, and how fast and how far it spreads. Complex partial seizures frequently present as altered or 'automatic' behaviour. The patient may pluck at his or her clothes, fiddle with objects and act in a confused manner. Lip smacking or chewing movements, grimacing, undressing, the carrying out of purposeless activities or of aimless wandering may all occur on their own or in different combinations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: The present review is focused on juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL; Batten disease) due to a mutation in CLN3 . Functional vision impairment occurring around 5–6 years of age is the first symptom in more than 80% of patients. Approximately 2 years later (though sometimes simultaneously), obvious signs of cognitive impairment appear. Behavior problems can occur in advance, especially in boys. These include anxious and depressed mood, aggressive behavior, and hallucinations, and even psychotic symptoms. Following the teens, severe dementia is present, including loss of memory, attention, and general reasoning abilities, as well as loss of independent adaptive skills such as mobility, feeding, and communicating. Sleep abnormalities, such as settling problems, nocturnal awakenings, and nightmares, are reported in more than half of patients. The vast majority, if not all, patients develop seizures, starting at approximately 10 years of age. Generalized tonic–clonic seizure occurs as the only type of seizure in approximately half of patients, and in combination with partial seizures in a third of patients. There seems to be no difference in seizure severity according to sex or genotype, and there is great variation in seizure activity among patients. Soon after diagnosis, patients begin to have slight ataxic symptoms, and at adolescence extrapyramidal symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia, slow steps with flexion in hips and knees) occur with increasing frequency. Chewing and swallowing difficulties emerge as well, and food intake is hampered in the late teens. Disabling periodically involuntary movements may occur as well. A progressive cardiac involvement with repolarization disturbances, ventricular hypertrophy, and sinus-node dysfunction, ultimately leading to severe bradycardia and/or other conduction abnormalities, starts in the mid-teens. Patients are usually bedridden at 20 years of age, and death usually occurs in the third decade of life.

This form of the disease is a progressive lesion of the nervous system, characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the membranes and /or tissue of cerebrum or spinal cord, cranial and /or peripheral nerves. Clinical signs of the nervous system disorder found in sarcoidosis, are detected only in 5–15% of patients. They are often represented by symptoms of cranial nerve damage, meningeal syndrome and epileptic seizures. X-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain do not reveal specific changes, however, they allow to exclude other structural lesions of the central nervous system and to identify neuroimaging signs, most common in the course of this disease. Diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is possible in the presence of neurological symptoms, signs of multisystem lesions, and histological confirmation of non-caseous granulomatous inflammation in one or more organs. The article also represents a clinical observation of a patient with neurosarcoidosis, manifested by acute bilateral neuropathy of the facial nerves, unilateral neuropathy of the trigeminal nerve and meningism syndrome. The neuroimaging signs, often found in this disease, were revealed: the accumulation of contrast agent by the membranes of the brain and the tissue of cavum Meckeli. The course of the disease and diagnostic search, which made it possible to detect signs of multisystem lesion, are described. The diagnosis was confirmed by histological examination of the biopsy material of the intrathoracic lymph node. The results of neurosarcoidosis anti-inflammatory therapy are presented. The peculiarities influencing the choice of this type of treatment terms, are indicated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. In most individuals, the symptoms of the disease begin with mild memory difficulties after the sixth decade of life. Symptoms progress slowly, leading to significant impairment in memory, language, executive function, and other domains of cognition. Eventually, impaired cognitive abilities interfere with complex activities of daily life and ultimately result in the loss of independent function. The diagnosis is typically made in this context on the basis of clinical evidence of dementia with progressive impairment in multiple domains of cognition. Structural neuroimaging is often used in the clinical setting to evaluate for the presence of other pathologies (e.g. cerebrovascular or neoplastic disease). Functional neuroimaging, such as PET or SPECT, may be employed clinically to assist in the discrimination of different types of dementia (e.g. frontotemporal vs. Alzheimer’s dementia). Current treatments are primarily symptomatic, in that clinical trials demonstrate short-term stabilization of cognitive function but not a slowing of the rate of decline. Increasing emphasis is being placed on the development of disease-modifying therapies — drugs that impede the underlying pathophysiologic process of neurodegeneration in AD and, thereby, slow the rate of cognitive decline.",

SD is characterized by fluent, effortless, grammatical speech which lacks informational content, with limited and repetitive content, as well as semantic paraphasias. Also, patients may present with associative visual agnosia, surface dyslexia or dysgraphia, behavioral alterations. Both episodic and autobiographical memory are close to normality. Two female patients with fluent progressive aphasia are reported; they failed in a simple test of semantic association (to point to one of four objects with lesser relation to others).

Some NMS may antedate the diagnosis of PD. Examples of NMS include cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, visual dysfunction, sleep abnormalities, and psychiatric disorders. NMS are associated with wide-ranging abnormalities in extranigral dopaminergic systems and non-dopaminergic (e.g. cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic) systems. The type and severity of NMS vary based on age, disease severity, and predominant motor symptoms. NMS can be disabling and reduce quality of life. Treatment of NMS can be challenging. Some NMS are helped by dopaminergic treatment, whereas others can be induced or exacerbated by treatments that help the motor dysfunction. Physicians should probe their PD patients about their NMS and address them for better care. Clinical trials should incorporate NMS as outcomes for more meaningful conclusions on the effect of treatments under investigation.",

Pathological findings for fluctuating and non-fluctuating cases were compared. Patients with motor fluctuations had a younger age of onset and longer disease course (P < 0.001), although mean age at death was almost the same. Four milestones of advanced disease (frequent falls, visual hallucinations, cognitive disability and need for residential care) occurred at a similar time from death in each group; this interval was not proportionate to the disease duration. There were no significant differences in the severity or distribution of Lewy body or other pathologies. Irrespective of the pattern of levodopa response, patients reach a common pathological endpoint at a similar age, and the duration and manifestations of end-stage disease are alike.

It is a question of characterizing bruxism in connection with not only dental problems but also sleep disorders. The etiology of bruxism is not formally elucidated, there is however a strong consensus on its multifactorial origin. Bruxism would be caused by central factors (neuropathic or psycho-emotional) involving the central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic (ANS) modulated among other things by sleep and the psychic state. In addition, certain local factors can maintain the parafunction: breathing disorders and sleep parasomnia in particular revealing a pattern of intricate cause-consequences.

      "abstract": "Behavioral and psychophysiological assays provide the most sensitive indication of whether a presumed neurotoxin has a deleterious effect on the nervous system. The effects of lead on the nervous system are strongly suggestive that this agent can produce disturbances in attention; moreover, there are clinical reports of such effects. The action of lead is also manifest in behaviors described as \"hyperactive,\" or reflecting \"minimal brain damage.\" The core symptom in both disorders is probably impairment in attention. The recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III) of the American Psychiatric Association uses the term Attention Deficit Disorder to replace such terms as hyperactivity and minimal brain damage. Prior studies of the behavioral toxicity of lead may have used inadequate or incomplete assays of attention; this could in part account for the variability in outcomes. Recent research on attention suggests that it is a complex behavior consisting of a number of elements or components, each of which may be in part dependent upon a different region of the central nervous system. Behavioral assays should examine the components of attentive behavior using tests which are sensitive to the different elements. It is recommended that psychophysiological assays (using cognitive event-related potentials), although more difficult and costly to implement, be used as well. These assays may provide a more dynamic view of altered information processing in the brain and help to localize and characterize the behavioral impairment.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder is a severe, chronic, and disabling illness that adversely impacts the child's psychosocial development including family, social, and academic functioning. Prevalence of bipolar disorder is about 1% in adolescents. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and younger adolescents is a challenge, as symptoms may differ from those typically observed in late adolescence and adulthood. One main area of debate centers around the core mood symptom of pediatric mania. The presence of classic cardinal symptoms of euphoria and/or grandiosity characterized by distinctive developmental expressions is emphasized by one view, while another view stresses the distinctly assaultive and persistent irritability of pediatric mania. The non-episodic, continuous, rapid cycling pattern and the high rate of mixed mania pose additional diagnostic challenge, as clinicians may not be able to rely on the typical presence of mood swings to make the diagnosis. Frequent occurrence of comorbid disorders exhibiting symptom overlap with pediatric mania, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may further complicate the diagnosis. Appreciation of current evidence combined with exercise of good clinical judgment may help clinicians optimally diagnose a substantial number of psychiatrically referred youths who present with a complex and severe symptomatology suggestive of bipolar disorder.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital and complex physiological process which is critical to maintain normal functioning of the nervous system1. Research suggests that lack of sleep or sleep disorders increase the risk of several health issues including hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, depression, and obesity1. In this article, we aim to discover the relationship between sleep disorders and neurological diseases and its implications for diagnosis and management. Sleep disorders have been shown to have an impact on several neurological diseases. Poor sleep can increase the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), multiple sclerosis, and Huntington disease2. Moreover, sleep disorders have also been shown to have an impact on increasing the risk of stroke, epilepsy, and affecting cognitive function such as learning and memory. Furthermore, autism spectrum disorder and neuropathic pain have also shown to have an association with sleep disorders2. Just like sleep disorders have a negative impact on the nervous system, some neurological diseases can affect the sleeping patterns of an individual. A few central nervous system conditions have been shown to cause sleep apnea which results in a disturbed circadian rhythm resulting in difficulty sleeping at night. Over 50% of patients with a history of stroke have reported of sleeping problems. Moreover, AD and PD have also been shown to have an association with poor sleep3. Establishing a robust diagnosis of sleep disorders in patients with neurological diseases can prove to be challenging due to overlap in symptoms which may lead to misdiagnosis. The current gold standard test for diagnosing sleeping disorders is polysomnography4. Other tests include: lab testing to screen for stimulants or other medications which may increase the level of alertness and disturb sleep; Multiple Sleep Latency Test to determine the degree of sleepiness; Maintenance of Wakefulness Test to test for the ability of staying awake; and actigraphy which includes the use of a device worn on the writs which provides data regarding periods of rest and/or sleep activities5. Even though these tests are accurate per se, there are always certain limitations. In order to understand the complex relationship between neurological diseases and sleep disorders, there is a need for emerging diagnostic technologies to improve accuracy which is critical for providing an early intervention and improving patient outcomes. Treating sleep disorders among patients with underlying neurological disorders can also be arduous, given the complex nature of the relationship between the two. Therapies targeted toward treating sleep disorders include light therapy, orofacial therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). In addition, medical management includes the use of medications such as benzodiazepines (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone), melatonin receptor agonists (eg, ramelteon), and orexin receptor antagonists (eg, suvorexant)6. Furthermore, continuous positive airway pressure has shown promising results in improving sleep among patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea7. Although the discussed managements and treatments are excellent for treating sleep disorders, there still remains a lack of literature in the management and treatment for sleeping disorders among those with underlying neurological disorders. Thus, there is a need for more targeted therapies which take account of the underlying mechanisms of sleep disorders and neurological diseases. Collaboration between neurologists and sleep specialists is crucial to enhance the identification and early intervention of sleep disorder and neurological diseases. It is also imperative for primary care physicians to have a strong understanding of sleep abnormalities in patients with neurological conditions. These physicians can screen patients for sleep disorders and refer them so specialists for further evaluation and treatment, which will provide appropriate care to the patients and improve outcomes. Moreover, educating the patients regarding importance of sleep and their beneficial effects on neurological health is essential. The combined effort of patients and their health care professionals will provide a more comprehensive care for those suffering with neurological diseases and sleep disorders. To conclude, sleep is crucial for optimal functioning of the nervous system and research has shown that sleep disorders increase the likelihood of several health issues. The relationship between sleep disorders and neurological disorders in complex making appropriate diagnosis and treatment challenging. Poor sleep has been linked to various neurological diseases including AD, PD, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington disease. Establishing an accurate diagnosis of sleep disorders in patients with neurological disease is necessary for early intervention and improved outcomes. Moreover, targeted therapies that consider the underlying disease mechanisms of sleep disorders and neurological are needed to improve management and treatment of these patients. Collaboration between neurologists, sleep specialists, and primary care physicians is necessary for better identifications and treatment of sleep disorders in patients with underlying neurological conditions. Lastly, educating the patients regarding the importance of sleep and encouraging a combined effort between patients and health care providers will provide a more comprehensive care for those with neurological diseases and sleep disorders.

      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy is the most common cause of physical disability in early childhood. Epilepsy is known to have a high association with cerebral palsy. All types of epileptic seizures can be seen in patients with cerebral palsy. Complex partial and secondary generalized ones are the most frequent seizure types. In persons with cerebral palsy and mental retardation, the diagnosis of epilepsy presents unique difficulties. Generally they are not able to describe the epileptic events themselves, parents are not able to describe them without fear and persons trained in epilepsy witness the events only rarely. Some syndromes, such as infantile spasms. West and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, are particularly frequent, whereas children with cerebral palsy are rarely free of epilepsy. It has been observed that epileptic seizures in children with cerebral palsy tend to have an earlier onset; they often appear in children with cerebral palsy and mental retardation; they are more severe in patients with a more severe degree of cerebral palsy. The overall outcome of seizures in children with cerebral palsy is poor, requiring prolonged course of antiepileptic medications, polytherapy with higher incidence of refractory seizures and hospital admissions for status epilepticus. The presence of a neurological deficit, as well as cerebral palsy, does not necessarily mean a poor prognosis after the discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs, but the risk of a relapse in persons with cerebral palsy is high.The objective of the paper was to show the relationship between cerebral palsy and epilepsy and to determine the occurrence, associated factors, nature and prognosis of epilepsy in children with cerebral palsy.",

      "title": "The role of mitochondrial dysfunction in psychiatric disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders are a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous disorders caused by the biochemical complexity of mitochondrial respiration and the fact that two genomes, one mitochondrial and one nuclear, encode the components of the respiratory chain. These disorders can manifest at birth or present later in life. They result, at least in part, in defective production of ATP. Typically, mitochondrial disorders affect tissues with high energetic demands such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and the central nervous system. Neurological dysfunction is the most frequent clinical presentation of these disorders. The central nervous system is highly dependent on oxidative metabolism, and particular mitochondrial disorders are accompanied by focal brain necrosis (Leigh disease), dementia, or static encephalopathy. Furthermore, many children with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies present with more subtle and indolent signs including focal cognitive deficits of memory, perception, and language. Some subjects with mitochondrial disorders may also exhibit nonverbal cognitive impairment, compromised visuospatial abilities, and short‐term memory deficits associated with working memory that likely reflect defects in synaptic plasticity. Psychiatric features are found within the clinical spectrum of mitochondrial syndromes. It is increasingly recognized that mitochondrial dysfunction may be associated with neuropsychiatric abnormalities such as dementia, major depression, and bipolar disorder. Furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that there is involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in schizophrenia, including documented alterations in brain energy metabolism, electron transport chain activity, and expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function. The purpose of this review article is to summarize the psychiatric features observed in mitochondrial cytopathies and discuss possible mechanisms of dysfunctional cellular energy metabolism that underlie the pathophysiology of major subsets of psychiatric disorders. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "abstract": "Neuro-otological and posturography findings in 15 patients with visually induced vertiginous symptoms (visual vertigo) are reported. Thirteen patients were considered to have a peripheral vestibular disorder; seven had abnormal caloric or rotational test results. Two patients had CNS disorder--a cerebellar degeneration and a brainstem stroke. Posturography testing showed that five patients showed abnormally large body sway induced by full field visual motion stimulation. This group included the two patients with CNS disease and four with strabismic symptoms (diplopia, squint surgery, and ocular muscle weakness). It is concluded that visual vertigo is a heterogeneous syndrome with peripheral or central aetiologies and may occur if patients with balance disorders show high visual field dependence. In patients with visual vertigo, the presence of additional CNS or strabismic symptoms may cause inappropriate postural reactions in environments with conflicting or disorienting visual stimuli, probably by reducing the ability to resolve the sensory conflict.",

      "title": "Differential Diagnosis of Dementia",
      "abstract": "The differential diagnosis of dementia is a two-stage process. The first stage is the differentiation of dementia from other causes of cognitive impairment. The differential diagnosis of dementia includes: depression; delirium, drugs; normal ageing and circumstances where the diagnosis is problematic such as when the patient has severe sensory deficits. Second, if it is found to be a form of dementia, the elucidation of the aetiology. Alzheimer's disease is the commonest form of dementia, cerebrovascular disease is probably the second commonest cause and Lewy body dementia is becoming increasingly recognised. Other conditions that can be excluded on clinical grounds without resort to complex and detailed investigations are subcortical dementias (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and progressive supranuclear palsy), alcohol induced dementia and a number of toxic/metabolic abnormalities such as endocrine disorders and carcinoma. The differential diagnosis of dementia is an excellent example of where simple logical clinical skills can be applied without the need for expensive investigation, which should be reserved for situations in which there is clinical doubt about the diagnosis. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is diagnosed on clinical grounds and in the presence of a characteristically abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG). For a comprehensive assessment of a person with suspected dementia, the following are necessary: detailed family and personal history and history of the current illness from a reliable informant; mental state examination of the patient with particular reference to the cognitive state; physical examination with particular emphasis on the central nervous system and; investigations, including haematological and biochemical blood tests, serum B12 and folate, thyroid function tests, chest X-ray and ECG. Other investigations may also be helpful such as CT scan or EEG.",

These include infections, degenerative disorders, brain injury and cerebrovascular lesions, principally involving the frontal lobes and basal ganglia. The current patient had obsessive images, anxiety, auditory hallucinations and seizures following (possible) gliomatosis cerebri, with onset around 69 years of age. The atypical presentation, lesions involving the cortical–basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical circuit and the association with neurological signs/symptoms, was characteristic. However, late-onset OCD has not been commonly reported with diffuse lesions, and the association with gliomatosis cerebri is not known. This patient's case illustrates the need for careful screening of older patients with recently acquired OCD, and for further systematic study of OCD in the broad range of neuropsychiatric disorders affecting the elderly.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of dementia increases with age. In rare cases, people younger than 65 years old are also affected, with substantial consequences for the professional life. The symptoms depend on the form of dementia and can vary individually. Impairment of short-term memory is not always in the foreground and other neurocognitive domains, such as the disturbance of executive functions can have a significant impact on the ability to cope with everyday life. Pathophysiologically, neurodegenerative dementias with the major forms of Alzheimer's dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia are distinguished from vascular dementias. Mixed forms are common. There is no curative treatment, but progression can be slowed by nonpharmacological measures and, especially in Alzheimer's dementia, by pharmacological treatment. Appropriate measures can promote independence and autonomy for as long as possible; however, in the course of the disease restrictions in the extended activities of independent living will initially occur, such as banking transactions, use of means of transport and, in the further course, also in the basic activities of daily living. Legal capacity and the ability to consent to health interventions are restricted sooner or later; however, this must always be evaluated for the specific situation and is not generally the case with the diagnosis of dementia. Instruments such as living wills, identification of a health care proxy, and advanced care planning should be used at an early stage. To decrease family caregiver burden with the increased risk of developing depression, supportive, accompanying measures and education are of great importance.Demenzen treten mit zunehmendem Lebensalter vermehrt auf. In seltenen Fällen sind auch jüngere Menschen betroffen, mit erheblichem Einfluss auf die Berufstätigkeit. Die Symptome hängen von der Demenzform ab und können individuell unterschiedlich ausgeprägt sein. Nicht immer steht die Störung des Kurzzeitgedächtnisses im Vordergrund, vielmehr können andere neurokognitive Domänen wie die Störung der Exekutivfunktion sich erheblich auf die Alltagsfähigkeit auswirken. Pathophysiologisch werden die neurodegenerativen Demenzen mit den wichtigsten Formen Alzheimer-Demenz, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz und frontotemporale Demenz abgegrenzt von den vaskulären Demenzen. Mischformen sind häufig. Eine kurative Therapie besteht nicht, die Progression kann jedoch durch nichtpharmakologische Maßnahmen und, insbesondere bei der Alzheimer-Demenz, auch durch pharmakologische Therapie abgebremst werden. Es gilt, die Selbstständigkeit und Autonomie betroffener Patienten zu fördern. Im Verlauf kommt es jedoch zunächst zu Einschränkungen in den erweiterten Aktivitäten der selbstständigen Lebensführung wie Bankgeschäften, Nutzung von Verkehrsmitteln und im weiteren Verlauf auch den basalen Funktionen der Selbsthilfefähigkeit. Geschäftsfähigkeit und Einwilligungsfähigkeit in Bezug auf gesundheitliche Eingriffe sind früher oder später eingeschränkt. Dies muss jedoch immer wieder für die konkrete Situation evaluiert werden und liegt nicht grundsätzlich mit der Diagnose Demenz vor. Frühzeitig sollten Instrumente wie die Patientenverfügung, Vorsorgevollmacht oder vorausschauende Gesundheitsplanung („advance care planning“) genutzt werden. Pflegende Angehörige sind häufig stark belastet und haben ein erhöhtes Risiko, an einer Depression zu erkranken. Daher sind unterstützende begleitende Maßnahmen von großer Bedeutung.",

PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorders include PURA syndrome, caused by a heterozygous pathogenic sequence variant in PURA, and 5q31.3 deletion syndrome, caused by a genomic 5q31.3 deletion encompassing all or part of PURA. PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by moderate to severe neurodevelopmental delay with absence of speech in most and lack of independent ambulation in many. Early-onset problems can include hypotonia, hypothermia, hypersomnolence, feeding difficulties, excessive hiccups, recurrent central and obstructive apneas, epileptic seizures, abnormal non-epileptic movements (dystonia, dyskinesia, and dysconjugate eye movements), and abnormal vision. Congenital heart defects, urogenital malformations, skeletal abnormalities, and endocrine disorders occur, but are less common. Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of a PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorder is established in a proband with either a heterozygous PURA pathogenic sequence variant (90% of affected individuals) or a non-recurrent deletion of 5q31.3 that encompasses all or part of PURA (10%). Management. Treatment of manifestations: Ongoing routine care by a multidisciplinary team. Treatment and/or therapy for developmental delays; neurologic findings (hypotonia, seizures, abnormal movements); feeding difficulties; apnea; visual impairment; and malformations of the heart, urogenital tract, and skeleton. Surveillance: Long-term follow up to assess psychomotor development, seizures or suspected seizures, vision, feeding for dysphagia, and musculoskeletal complications (hip dysplasia and scoliosis). Genetic counseling. PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorders, caused by either a heterozygous PURA pathogenic sequence variant or a 5q31.3 deletion encompassing all or part of PURA are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In almost all probands with a PURA pathogenic sequence variant the sequence variant is de novo; to date, all reported 5q31.3 deletions have been de novo. For parents of an affected child, the risk to future pregnancies is presumed to be low, as a de novo genetic alteration involving PURA is most likely in the proband. However, parents of an affected child may wish to consider prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis as risk may be greater than in the general population owing to the possibility of parental germline mosaicism (estimated empirically at",

Positive sensory symptoms can arise spontaneously or as a response to stimulation, and they are often classified into painful and non-painful descriptors. Positive symptoms of neuropathy are distressing, often at night, disabling, and difficult to treat. Diabetic nerves are thought to be more susceptible to mechanical injury.

      "title": "A non-neurodegenerative REM parasomnia with immersive dreaming and dream-reality confusion: a case report",
      "abstract": "Background REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by loss of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep, often associated with dream enactment behaviors, and is typically a prodromal neurodegenerative condition in middle-aged and older adults. However, emerging case reports and case series suggest that not all RBD presentations follow this trajectory, particularly in younger individuals. Case presentation A case of 7-year history of vivid, immersive dreaming perceived as continuous with waking life, accompanied by persistent dream-reality confusion, is described. The patient frequently engaged in reality-testing behaviors and reported significant cognitive fatigue. Video-polysomnography confirmed REM sleep without atonia and a concordant dream re-enactment episode. Neuropsychiatric evaluation ruled out dissociative or psychotic disorders, and no evidence of neurodegenerative disease was observed. Conclusion This presented case illustrates a potentially distinct, non-neurodegenerative REM parasomnia phenotype that underscores the need to expand current parasomnia classifications to better capture the diverse cognitive and metacognitive dimensions of REM sleep disorders. Moreover, potential mechanisms underlying the main features of this case, including immersive dreaming and persistent dream-reality confusion, are discussed in relation to hypothesized dysfunction in melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) signaling.",

The correct diagnosis was established by the electroencephalographic study, in one case after the patient experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and in the other, after failure to improve with supposedly adequate treatment. There are reports of patients with NCSE whose symptoms suggest a psychiatric disorder (inappropriate behavior, emotional disinhibition, perseveration, reduced speech and motivation). This can occur without altered consciousness and symptoms may fluctuate, making the correct diagnosis extremely difficult. This entity can occur at any age and without a previous history of seizures.

      "abstract": "Individuals with night-eating syndrome (NES) exhibit specific behavioral disturbances in the areas of sleep, eating, and mood. They have difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep and believe they will not be able to fall asleep unless they eat. Individuals with NES frequently experience significant mental distress and a worsening of mood in the evening. NES generally begins in early adulthood, although it may start during the teenage years. It is a long-standing problem for individuals. Symptoms may worsen with stressful life circumstances. Prognosis is dependent on accurately diagnosing the NES along with any coexisting disorders. The relationship between sleep disorders and eating behaviors is of considerable scientific interest and an area of active investigation and evolving conceptualization. Patients with NES eat most of their calories after the evening meal. They eat “in order to sleep”, and each eating episode is generally shorter and involves fewer calories.",

The physician involved in the care of these patients knows that the disease may present itself also with extramotor symptoms, which condition a more difficult management of the patient. The non-motor symptoms are classified in four categories in order of management importance: 1) disautonomic, 2) cognitive, 3) affective and 4) sensitive. These symptoms are more frequent and difficult to manage in late stage of disease, except for affective type, which may be precox and adaptive at the communication of the diagnosis or sometime precede it. The more frequent disautonomic symptoms are: constipation, symptoms related to the uro-genital sphere, the cardio-pressor regulation (orthostatic hypotension), the thermoregulation, sialorrhea dysphagia and seborrhoea. The cognitive symptoms: isolate (bradyphrenia, alteration of executive function) or dementia with or without delirium and allucinosis. The affective symptoms: depression, agitation, anxiety, panic attacks. The sensitive symptoms: pain, dysesthesia, paresthesia with bizzarre features (cold sensation, numbness, interior agitation). There are other symptoms which are not framing in the previous categories: sleep, respiratory and circulatory disorders (venous and lymphatic), which have different causal factors: emotional-affective, motor and iatrogenic. The therapeutic intervention on these symptoms is of essential importance in the management of the patient with Parkinson's disease, with a great impact on his quality of life.

It has a significant impact on populations and is characterized by chronically disturbed sleep and sleep loss, non-refreshing sleep, and heightened arousal in bed. Poor sleep is associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes, and it is reported that poorer quality of life and medical, neurological, and psychiatric comorbidities disrupt sleep. Sleep difficulties may result from multiple etiologies; however, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying chronic insomnia disorder are not sufficiently understood. Recently, numerous neuroimaging studies have been conducted to investigate the structural or functional derangement in the brains of patients with chronic insomnia disorder. The development of neuroimaging techniques has provided insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms that make patients with chronic sleep disturbances vulnerable to cognitive impairment.

      "abstract": "Neuropathies of peripheral nerves may be classified according to various criteria. The most important classification is the one according to the etiology, which differentiates between acquired or inherited forms. Among the acquired and hereditary neuropathies further subdivision has been proposed. Acquired and hereditary neuropathies are classified according to the course as acute or chronic. Acquired and hereditary neuropathies may be accompanied by involvement of other systems/organs/tissues or not. The latter are further classified according to the degree of co-affection of other organs or tissues as dominant or non-dominant. In non-dominant cases, neuropathy is overshadowed by manifestations of other organs. The course may be chronic progressive or relapsing remitting (Tangier's disease, porphyrias). Progressive neuropathies may be slowly or rapidly progressive. According to the number of affected nerves, mononeuropathies and polyneuropathies (PNPs) are distinguished. Among PNPs those with uniform affection of all nerves and those with predominant affection of several single nerves (multiplex neuropathy) are differentiated. PNPs are further classified according to the distribution as symmetric or asymmetric and as proximal or distal. Furthermore, neuropathies of the cranial nerves and the peripheral nerves are delineated. According to the direction of progression neuropathies can be ascending or descending. According to the types of nerve fibers affected they may be classified as motor, sensory, autonomic, or mixed neuropathies. According to the size of affected fibers, large- and small-fiber neuropathies (LFNs, SFNs) are delineated. Upon electrophysiological findings, axonal, demyelinating (with or without conduction block), or mixed neuropathies are differentiated. According to the prevalence, they may be classified as frequent or infrequent (rare). Neuropathies can be painful or painless. Neuropathies can be length-dependent (i.e. distal, the longer the more severe, dying-back), which is the case for most of the neuropathies, or length-independent. Lastly, neuropathies may have an infantile/childhood onset or may have an onset in adolescence/adulthood. Some neuropathies may be accessible to treatment, others may not.",

Secondary dystonia may be further classifi ed into symptomatic dystonia and the dystonia-plus syndromes. Symptomatic dystonia is due to an identifi able brain disease, an obvious brain or peripheral insult, or a hereditary or sporadic degeneration of the brain.

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders, affective/emotional disorders and exposure to adverse life circumstances are the main sources of psychological impairment in school age children. They should be distinguished from transient psychological symptoms occurring in normal development that do not significantly affect children's emotional and social functioning. An early recognition and assessment is the first step towards adequate treatment of conditions associated with psychological impairment. Any severe or persistant behavioral or emotional symptom occurring in children should be considered a possible early sign of a neurodevelopmental disorder warranting further investigation. Neurodevelopmental disorders are generally associated with delays early in development affecting several domains (language, social functioning, emotional and behavorial regulation) and are predominant in boys. These disorders are highly comorbid and require multidisciplinary assessments and treatment plans. Emotional and behavioral conditions arising from early deprivation or maltreatment also affect various developmental domains and may have lasting consequences. Finally, many of the disorders showing rising prevalences in adolescence or early adulthood also have some developmental precursors before puberty. Progress in identification, appropriate assessment and treatment of early manifesting symptoms and conditions interfering with adaptive functioning is a major mental health issue requiring multidisciplinary competencies.",

      "abstract": "Advanced and delayed sleep phase disorders, and the hypersomnia that can accompany winter depression, have been treated successfully by appropriately timed artificial bright light exposure. Under entrainment to the 24-h day-night cycle, the sleep-wake pattern may assume various phase relationships to the circadian pacemaker, as indexed, for example, by abnormally long or short intervals between the onset of melatonin production or the core body temperature minimum and wake-up time. Advanced and delayed sleep phase syndromes and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome have been variously ascribed to abnormal intrinsic circadian periodicity, deficiency of the entrainment mechanism, or—most simply—patterns of daily light exposure insufficient for adequate phase resetting. The timing of sleep is influenced by underlying circadian phase, but psychosocial constraints also play a major role. Exposure to light early or late in the subjective night has been used therapeutically to produce corrective phase delays or advances, respectively, in both the sleep pattern and circadian rhythms. Supplemental light exposure in fall and winter can reduce the hypersomnia of winter depression, although the therapeutic effect may be less dependent on timing.",

Memory loss in subcortical VAD is characterized by poor retrieval and intact recognition. Apathy is ubiquitous in VAD and depression and psychosis are common. Parkinsonism with prominent gait disturbances in conjunction with pyramidal tract signs, dysarthria, pseudobulbar affect, and incontinence are frequent motor manifestations of VAD with small vessel disease.

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy, as one of the most prevalent neurological diseases in childhood, has a strong reciprocal relationship with sleep. Sleep-associated epilepsy syndromes in childhood are mostly genetic and can be divided into (a) the group of self-limited focal epilepsies of childhood including self-limited epilepsy with autonomic seizures (SeLEAS) and self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS) and (b) (non-self-limited) sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE). Sleep-accentuated (developmental and) epileptic encephalopathies (DEE/EE-SWAS, Landau–Kleffner syndrome [LKS]) are either genetic (possible transition from SeLEAS or SeLECTS) or structural, and they are characterized by continuous bilateral focal or generalized epileptic activity throughout the night with a clinical manifestation of stagnation or regression, in particular of cognition (verbal agnosia in LKS). Epilepsy syndromes with increased seizure frequency after sleep deprivation or with seizures in the transition to awakening include juvenile generalized epilepsy syndromes such as epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (GTCA) or juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), but also SeLECTS. Sleep is a very active process: Regeneration, reorganization, and consolidation of memory facilitate development and cognitive functioning. Epilepsy can alter sleep architecture and vice versa, which can appear as a vicious circle in epilepsies that are sleep related. Macrostructural elements of sleep such as sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wakefulness after sleep onset, REM and non-REM sleep fraction, as well as microstructural sleep elements such as slow-wave activity, slope of slow waves, cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), and physiological sleep figures, are important biomarkers with which to understand clinical symptoms such as cognitive stagnation and regression, to monitor treatment, but also to determine prognostic factors and will be an important tool for future studies.",

This may occur when a myelopathy has yet to evolve fully, or is highly asymmetrical, as in Brown-Séquard syndrome. Other potential distractions include fluctuating symptoms, as may accompany spinal cord demyelination, and pseudoneuropathic features, as seen acutely in spinal shock and in the chronic setting with some high cervical cord lesions. A second pathology, such as a polyneuropathy or polyradiculopathy, can mask the presence of a myelopathy. The converse situation, of non-myelopathic disease mimicking a cord lesion, arises typically when symptoms and/or signs approximate bilateral symmetry. This may happen with certain diseases of the brain, or of the peripheral nerves, with functional disorders and even occasionally with non-neurological disease.

      "abstract": "Autistic symptoms begin in the first years of life, and recent magnetic resonance imaging studies have discovered brain growth abnormalities that precede and overlap with the onset of these symptoms. Recent postmortem studies of the autistic brain provide evidence of cellular abnormalities and processes that may underlie the recently discovered early brain overgrowth and arrest of growth that marks the first years of life in autism. Alternative origins and time tables for these cellular defects and processes are discussed. These cellular and growth abnormalities are most pronounced in frontal, cerebellar, and temporal structures that normally mediate the development of those same higher order social, emotional, speech, language, speech, attention, and cognitive functions that characterize autism. Cellular and growth pathologies are milder and perhaps nonexistent in other structures (e.g., occipital cortex), which are known to mediate functions that are often either mildly affected or entirely unaffected in autistic patients. It is argued that in autism, higher order functions largely fail to develop normally in the first place because frontal, cerebellar, and temporal cellular and growth pathologies occur prior to and during the critical period when these higher order neural systems first begin to form their circuitry. It is hypothesized that microstructural maldevelopment results in local and short distance overconnectivity in frontal cortex that is largely ineffective and in a failure of long-distance cortical-cortical coupling, and thus a reduction in frontal-posterior reciprocal connectivity. This altered circuitry impairs the essential role of frontal cortex in integrating information from diverse functional systems (emotional, sensory, autonomic, memory, etc.) and providing context-based and goal-directed feedback to lower level systems.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common finding in Parkinson's disease (PD), even in the early stages. The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD was recently formalized with diagnosis being reached after impairments in neuropsychological tasks become significant in at least one domain. The brain profile of cognitive deficits involves executive functions (e. g., planning, set shifting, set maintenance, problem solving), attention and memory function. Memory deficits are characterized by impairments in delayed recall, temporal ordering and conditional associate learning. PD patients demonstrate relatively preserved recognition. Visuospatial dysfunctions have also been reported, while language is largely preserved. The existence of two distinct mild cognitive syndromes has also been suggested. One of these affects mainly the frontostriatal executive deficits that are modulated by dopaminergic medications and by a genetically determined level of prefrontal cortex dopamine release. The other affects the more-posterior cortical abilities, such as visuospatial and memory functions, and is suggested to be associated with an increased risk for conversion to dementia. Cross-sectional studies have commonly reported dementia in 20-30% of PD patients, although the 8-year cumulative incidence of dementia may be as high as 78%. Factors associated with dementia in PD are age at onset, age at the time of examination, akinetic-rigid form PD, depression, hallucination, rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder and severe olfactory deficits. Clinical features generally involve the same type of deficits as those found in MCI patients, which are more severe and more extensive. The phenomenology of the dementia syndrome is similar to that seen in dementia with Lewy bodies, and clinicopathological correlation studies have revealed varying results with regard to neurochemical deficits and the pathological substrate underlying cognitive impairment and dementia. Early cognitive impairment, particularly in the form of executive dysfunction, is indicative of mainly fronto-striatal pathologic changes and might originate during nigrostriatal and subsequent mesocortical dopamine denervation. A potential parallel noradrenergic deficit and cholinergic deficit disturbance in patients without dementia might also contribute to MCI. Extensive pathological changes in Lewy bodies lead to widespread cortical and subcortical degeneration and profound cholinergic deficits, and might lead to the development of dementia. Several studies have revealed a significant correlation between dementia and Alzheimer-type pathology.",

      "abstract": "Background: Psychosis is a debilitating mental disorder characterized by a profound disconnection from reality, manifesting in symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. The pathophysiology of psychosis is multifaceted, involving an interplay of neurobiological, genetic, and environmental factors. Neurobiologically, dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems particularly dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic pathways-plays a central role, with excessive dopaminergic activity linked to positive symptoms and glutamatergic dysfunction implicated in cognitive impairments. Genetic predisposition, evidenced by significant heritability and associations with specific genetic variants, intersects with environmental factors such as stress, trauma, and substance use to influence the onset and progression of psychosis. Cognitive disruptions, including deficits in attention, memory, and executive function, exacerbate the disorder’s impact. This phenomenon has led to short-term as well as long-term psychosocial and mental health implications for all. Objective: To determine the antipsychotic activity of pharmaceuticals, numerous antipsychotic screening models are available. Determining the optimal animal model for measuring antipsychotic activity is the primary goal of this study. Methods: A search for literature was carried out using several keywords, including \"Antipsychotic,\" \"In-vivo models,\" \"In-vitro models,\" and \"Behavior models,\" on the databases Science Direct and PubMed. For the purpose of obtaining the most appropriate articles to fulfil the goal of this review article, the search was customized by using the necessary filters. Results: Research and review articles based on neuroleptic screening models are available to determine the antipsychotic activity of novel pharmacological compounds. Conclusion: Following our research, we identified several helpful models for evaluating the antipsychotic activity of pharmaceuticals and proposed that combining invitro and in-vivo techniques with behavioral methodologies might yield the most appropriate results for our field of study.",

      "title": "ACUTE GENERAL PARESIS",
      "abstract": "The acute onset of general paresis is a dramatic and often catastrophic event in the life of an individual. The initial symptoms have been described as being either a delirium, convulsive seizures, catatonic phenomena, or an acute confusional state. In general they show various grades of stupor and acute clouding of the consciousness. The acute onset carries with it a serious prognosis. The type which begins with a delirium usually runs a fulminating course. The three other types may also run a short and rapidly fatal course, but may progress into the chronic form of general paresis. The catatonic type of case, as has been pointed out, may be difficult to distinguish from schizophrenia but the serology and the marked organic intellectual disturbances differentiate the case of general paresis. The pathology in these acute cases shows an extensive and active meningo-encephalitis. The vessels in the meninges, as well as in the cortex, have a pronounced mononuclear perivascular cuffing, and this reaction extends deeply into the cortical tissue. In general, the reaction is more intense than in the usual type of case11. In the usual chronic cases, the pathology is more marked in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes in that order, and microspically, it is typical to find various grades of pathological alterations lying side by side with numerous cells that appear entirely normal. In the acute case one sees all cells of the cortex showing in various degrees indications of the disease process. These cells show Nissl's so-called grave alteration which probably results inevitably in the destruction of the cell. The cortical laminations show the characteristic distortion and a decrease in the number of neurones. Neuroglia stains reveal an increase in astrocytes, and vascular proliferation. Microglia stains show the typical rod cells. In some spirochaetes were demonstrated. Merritt12 and his co-workers have shown that the capillaries in brains affected with general paresis are obstructed by swollen endothelial cells and that the hypertrophied endothelium contains phagocytosed spirochaetes and blood pigment. We suggest that the acute symptoms occurring in general paresis may be due to the marked vascular reaction as shown by the intense perivascular infiltration. The rapidity of the course in many of these acute cases is such that often death may supervene before adequate treatment can be instituted. In an acute case, an emergency can be said to exist. Immediate treatment is imperative. It is true that in a large number of cases the acute symptoms will subside without treatment, but this cannot be predicted in the individual case, for it is difficult to decide which case will proceed to a fatal termination. This problem is in some respects similar to that of acute appendicitis. It requires emergency care and treatment. Some13 have recommended immediate institution of fever therapy, malaria or other type. Others14 have recommended for prompt action the use of a soluble preparation of mercury, such as the bichloride, succinimide, or red iodide injected intramuscularly daily or every other day in doses varying from ⅛ to ½ grain. Solomon15 and his co-workers have indicated that the preliminary use of tryparsamide injections greatly enhances the probabilities of therapeutic success in the treatment of general paresis by fever, and that the improvement of spinal fluid findings occurs more rapidly following fever if the patient has first been prepared by treatment with tryparsamide. This method appears to be readily applicable to an acute case. Whatever method is used, prompt institution of treatment is indicated in order to avoid a fatal termination.",

It affects patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but it progresses more rapidly and its manifestations are more severe in type 1 diabetes [1, 2]. Diabetic neuropathy is defined by the presence of detectable sensory, motor, and autonomic nerve abnormalities on clinical examination, with or without the presence of symptoms [3, 4]. As many as 50% of the patients may be asymptomatic; diagnosis may only be made on examination or, in some cases, when the patient presents with a painless foot ulcer [5]. Other patients may not report symptoms, but admit on inquiry that their feet feel numb. A careful neurological examination of the lower limb usually reveals sensory loss as reflected by abnormal vibration, pressure, pain, or temperature perception, mediated by small and large fibers, as well as absence of ankle reflexes. Signs of autonomic neuropathy may include manifestations of, for example, impaired cardiovascular and gastrointestinal functions.",

      "abstract": "Global hypoactivity contrasting with apparently unaffected cognitive abilities was initially reported in cases of frontal damage and is now recognized as a leading behavioral feature of many cerebral diseases. Of the various terms used to refer to this behavioral change, \"apathy\" is now the most widely used. Global hypoactivity with apathy is easy to diagnose in patients without other obvious neuropsychiatric impairments. In other clinical contexts, the diagnosis of global hypoactivity with apathy requires the physician to first establish that hypoactivity and loss of motivation cannot be more readily explained by sensorimotor impairments (e.g., as observed in patients with stroke or Parkinson's disease) or cognitive impairments (e.g., as observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease). Many criteria and behavioral scales have been used to diagnose hypoactivity with apathy. The main differential diagnosis is depression and depressive symptoms, and distinguishing between these conditions and apathy may be particularly challenging. The mechanisms of hypoactivity with apathy remain uncertain and probably involve several dysfunctions, including the inability to attach motivational values to stimuli. We reviewed the frequency, characteristics, and determinants of hypoactivity with apathy in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, across the different stages of cognitive compromise. The diagnosis of this condition is an important step in identifying the source of difficulties in patients' activities of daily living.",

      "title": "Neurodevelopmental impairment advantage: The ability capital",
      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental conditions have long been viewed primarily through a deficit lens, focusing on impairment and limitation. This view is in line with the medical characterization of learning disability, autism, or cerebral palsy. In addition to defining distinctive impairments, experience and research have highlighted other more or less specific problems that come to be part of the expected clinical picture. This helps service providers to inform patients and design more comprehensive interventions, but it can also lead to systematic medicalization of people's situations, stigma, and barriers to participation. It is likely that many documented clinical features result from adversity factors and experience-dependent neuroplasticity that shape brain structure and connectivity. Individuals with neurodevelopmental impairments may experience idiosyncratic patterns of neuroplasticity due to atypical developmental trajectories. While these differences can lead to functional challenges, they can also be adaptive to some extent and give rise to remarkable strengths. Autism provides an illustrative example of the complex interplay between functional impairment and unique abilities. While autistic individuals often experience difficulties in social communication and interaction, they may exhibit exceptional skills in areas such as attention to detail, pattern recognition, and problem-solving. Recognizing and nurturing these strengths raise some (yet unresolved) questions about effective advantages in participation (e.g. a workplace autism advantage1) which are in keeping with the concept of neurodiversity.2 Similarly, more frequent exploration behaviours have been found to be associated with better performance in semantic search in children with higher levels of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and this could support beneficial cognitive strategies in some instances.3 Other seemingly paradoxical examples have been studied in individuals with dyslexia,4 in whom certain aspects of cognitive spatial search (e.g. how one navigates in space and finds objects within an environment) have also been documented. These include better holistic processing, allowing them to detect visual spatial inconsistencies more easily by inspecting images globally rather than analyzing details. They also include increased spontaneous use of cognitive search strategies that rely on memory. It has been suggested that these strategies can foster creativity and talent (e.g. in art, engineering, or entrepreneurship). Cognitive differences between individuals with autism, ADHD, or dyslexia, and typically developing populations have been tentatively ascribed to observed neuroanatomical, histological, or neurophysiological differences. For example, there is emerging evidence with regard to minicolumn circuitry in the neocortex.5 Cortical minicolumns are compact networks of a few dozens of connected neurons that are regarded as fundamental computational units involved in information processing. Fewer and smaller minicolumns have been demonstrated in the frontal and temporal lobes of autistic individuals, enabling stronger local short-range connectivity within these modules, and decreased long-range connectivity between modular units. Conversely, stronger global connectivity and decreased local connectivity were found in the minicolumn circuitry of people with dyslexia. This has been hypothesized to underlie various cognitive styles ranging from predominantly detail-oriented, local processing (e.g. autism) to holistically-oriented, gestalt processing (e.g. dyslexia). By better understanding the functioning repertoire and underlying anatomy and physiology, we might be able to design beneficial intervention. Perhaps even more importantly, we will be better armed to challenge the prevailing one-dimensional normative narrative and recognize unique abilities and inherent potential in individuals with neurodevelopmental differences that are usually labelled as impairments. And further, we should definitely move beyond any one-dimensional perspective that simplifies the discussion of neurodevelopmental conditions, or development or functioning in general, into a linear framework from ‘worse’ to ‘better’ because such a limited but still prevalent viewpoint fails to capture complexity and diversity. By embracing a multidimensional approach, we can recognize both the challenges and the advantages that exist for individuals with neurodevelopmental impairments. Not required",

The younger the subjects, however, the wider are the variations. In the first stage of life only massive cerebral lesions afford unquestionable EEG evidence: in evaluating dysrhythmias it is necessary to bear in mind their high incidence in normal subjects. Hence their meaning is to be understood only by prolonged longitudinal studies. The reference here is not only to diffuse or focal slow anomalies, but also to specific pathologic rhythms. The difficulty of interpreting such anomalies is particularly evident when epileptogenic potentials are found, since they may be signs of a lesion but their clinical correlations are uncertain. The concept of \"masked epilepsy\" must be rejected. Only the diagnoses of latent or proven epilepsy are admissible, and these epilepsies may be without direct relationship to the clinical, psychiatric or central nervous findings in the affected subject. Numerous genetic, afferential, emotional or biologic factors are involved in the development of non-lesional disorders. Accordingly, the EEG has only a minor contribution to make in the definition of mild focal or diffuse pathologic anatomy of the brain in the very young subject.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis is often complicated by an acute and reversible deterioration of mental status, which is associated with increased mortality and is consistent with delirium but can also be revealed by a focal neurologic sign. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is accompanied by abnormalities of electroencephalogram and somatosensory-evoked potentials, increased in biomarkers of brain injury (i.e., neuron-specific enolase, S-100 β-protein) and, frequently, by neuroradiological abnormalities, notably leukoencephalopathy. Its mechanism is highly complex, resulting from both inflammatory and noninflammatory processes that affect all brain cells and induce blood-brain barrier breakdown, dysfunction of intracellular metabolism, brain cell death, and brain injuries. Its diagnosis relies essentially on neurologic examination that can lead one to perform specific neurologic tests. Electroencephalography is required in the presence of seizure; neuroimaging in the presence of seizure, focal neurologic signs or suspicion of cerebral infection; and both when encephalopathy remains unexplained. In practice, cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be performed if there is any doubt of meningitis. Hepatic, uremic, or respiratory encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, drug overdose, withdrawal of sedatives or opioids, alcohol withdrawal delirium, and Wernicke's encephalopathy are the main differential diagnoses of sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Patient management is based mainly on controlling infection, organ system failure, and metabolic homeostasis, at the same time avoiding neurotoxic drugs.",

      "abstract": "This report deals with what is to be known in applying ENG in the everyday office. From vestibular, visual and proprioceptive informations central neural processing evolve to stabilize images on the retina. ENG can perform an analysis of these systems, alone or interacting. Anatomical, neurophysiological backgrounds and experimental pathophysiology results are first described. The methodic rule of anamnesis is emphasized and the non instrumental examination is outlined. Concerning the technical aspects and the ENG achievement, some nonlinearities are stressed. Next, procedure of eye movements recording, oculomotor and vestibular testing are described. Alertness, stimulation order, gaze direction and drugs influence the response. The nystagmus responses are evaluated by quantitative parameters and morphological aspects. The variability of these implies the multiplication of the pathological arguments. Peripheral vestibular disturbances lead to labyrinthine paresis or paralysis and to nystagmus directional preponderance, sometimes alone, often combined. Thermic predominance may be associated and cause of some interpretation difficulty. Diagnosis of central neurological disturbances is submitted to four conditions: only specific criteria selection; complete oculomotor and vestibular testing; graduated conclusions in function of the criteria number; no etiological but only functional or topographical diagnosis. Central vestibular syndromes lead also to labyrinthine weakness or nystagmus directional preponderance but, first at all, to specific criteria who are: saccadic, pursuit and horizontal optokinetic abnormalities, central spontaneous or positional nystagmus, failure of fixation suppression, hyperreflexia, perverted nystagmus, slowing of the nystagmus fast phases, slowing-down of the nystagmus slow phases, anisonystagmus, vertical optokinetic deficits and retraction nystagmus. Finally, these dysfunctions incidence in personal observations with some multi or unifocal central pathologies is described and the correspondent more characteristic findings are outlined.",

Adapted from reference 4Impaired mobility, disability Impaired gait and balance Neuromuscular or musculoskeletal disorders Age Impaired vision Neurological, heart disorders History of falls Medication Cognitive impairmentment of gait, mobility and balance are the most consistently identified risk factors for falls and fall-related injuries. The ability to maintain postural control and avoid environmental obstacles depends on proprioceptive, vestibular and visual input translated into appropriate motor responses. Thus, the risk of falling increases with reduced visual acuity or diminished sensory perception of the lower extremities. Chronic illnesses, such as various neurological disorders, heart diseases, stroke, urinary incontinence, depression and impaired cognitive functions, increase the risk of falling. Medications such as hypnotics, antidepressants or sedatives are associated with falls. Environmental factors include potential hazards that can be found in the home, such as slippery floors, unstable furniture or insufficient lighting. The orientation of falls influences the consequences of falling. Indeed, the points of impact of a fall determine the type and extent of injury. When falling, the elderly tend to land on the hip. In contrast, middle-aged adults tend to fall forward, with the main impact on the wrist. Several reflexes and postural responses are initiated during a fall which can prevent or reduce the injury. The effectiveness ofreflex actions depends on the speed of execution and the strength of the muscles initiating the protective movement. The impact of falls can be absorbed by surrounding soft tissue. The apparent protective effect of higher body weight may be due, at least in part, to the local shockabsorbing capacity of muscle and fat.",

      "title": "Birth transitions: Pathophysiology, the onset of consciousness and possible implications for neonatal maladjustment syndrome in the foal",
      "abstract": "Neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS), also known as hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, perinatal asphyxia syndrome and neonatal encephalopathy 1, 2, is reportedly the most common problem observed in neonatal foals during the first 72 h after birth 2. Neurological signs of NMS can range from subtle to severe and may include convulsions/seizures, weakness and behavioural abnormalities 3. While in severe cases an early death is likely, recovery is possible with human intervention, especially in less severe cases 1, 4. Neonatal maladjustment syndrome is mainly attributed to cerebral hypoxia and ischaemia leading to neuronal cell death shortly before, during or after birth 1, 2, 4. Signs of central nervous system (CNS) disease in equine neonatal patients have been attributed to hypoxic encephalopathy in 92% of cases, of which 59% experienced dystocia or premature placental separation 5. Other possible causes may include post natal persistence of or reversion to an inhibited fetal state of cerebral cortical function 2 and meningitis, congenital lesions, CNS haemorrhage or oedema, metabolic insults, sepsis, endotoxins, and in utero infections 6. Thus, NMS appears to represent a number of different but related conditions that reflect untoward responses to the exceptional physiological challenges that precede, accompany and follow expulsion from the uterus at birth. In line with the distinction made by Aleman et al. 2, the focus of this editorial will be the impact of variations in the oxygen status of the foal 7 and their suggestion that a fetal state of inhibited cerebral cortical function may be retained or return after birth 2. Although the latter area is of more contemporary interest 2, 8, both merit consideration because their effects may interact. The first area relates to established pathophysiological causes of impaired perinatal oxygen status and its various impacts on metabolic and other processes that support neonatal heat production 7. The second area concerns less well-recognised changes in the physiological environment of the brain during the transition of the young from the intrauterine to the extrauterine environment, in particular the impact of that on post natal levels of arousal and the onset of consciousness 9-11. Hindrances to the successful completion of this transition in brain function would jeopardise the newborn's capacity to interact with its physical environment and mother in ways that otherwise promote its survival and well-being. Finally, in addition to emphasising the above 2 areas, consideration will be limited to mild cases of NMS where brain function is only temporarily affected and is therefore reversibly inhibited. The well demonstrated prenatal increase in fetal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) activity is important for integrating 4 key processes. They are the onset of labour, an acceleration of fetal tissue maturation just before birth, the timely onset of colostrum/milk production by the mother, and a physiologically generated impetus to engage in mother–young bonding 12. All of these processes are crucial for neonatal survival, which is jeopardised if one or more of them is impaired. Moreover, superimposed on these processes may be negative impacts of pathophysiological and related conditions that arise as a result of placental insufficiency, intrapartum hypoxia, dystocia, premature birth, starvation of the newborn and maternal underfeeding. Each one of these has been discussed in detail elsewhere 7, 12, 13 and has been identified as relevant to some manifestations of NMS 1-4. Hypothermia is often observed shortly after outdoor births of ungulate young, is a common outcome of perinatal pathophysiology, may often be severe and predisposes the newborn to death or debility (Table 1). Importantly, in the context of managing impaired newborns, hypothermia of as little as 2–3°C is anticipated to result in some dulling of consciousness, and this in its turn may contribute to the reduced behavioural responsiveness of chilled newborns to their mothers 7. Hypothermia occurs in healthy vigorous newborns that mount full heat production responses to ambient cold that is so severe that heat loss still exceeds heat production. In contrast, hypoxia associated with placental insufficiency or dystocia can inhibit heat production sufficiently to cause hypothermia even at mild ambient temperatures. This inhibition is associated with various consequences of anaerobic metabolism as indicated by elevated concentrations of plasma lactate and hydrogen ions and evidence of metabolic and respiratory acidosis 14-16, and it is rarely associated with cerebral lesions 17, 18. The newborn may also be predisposed to hypothermia by immature shivering and nonshivering thermogenic mechanisms and/or by reduced energy reserves available to fuel heat production 13, 17, 19. Moreover, such immature newborns may be further disadvantaged by high rates of heat loss due to a high surface area to body weight ratio. Immaturity of other organ systems may also adversely affect their survival. Practically, however, normothermia can usually be restored and maintained by initially keeping most such newborns at air temperatures near the upper limit of their species-specific thermoneutral range 7, 12. Chronic fetal hypoxia Fetal undernutrition Fetal growth retardation Hypothermia Low birthweight Failure to suck due to weakness, competition, inadequate mothering Deficient production of colostrum/milk Hypoglycaemia Inhibited heat production Hypothermia in cold conditions Cerebral compromise in warm environments Infection Immature thermogenic mechanisms Reduced thyroidal and adrenocortical support of post natal metabolic activity Restricted placental size Fetal growth retardation Reduced deposition of fetal fat reserves Inadequate maternal udder development and colostrum/milk production Inhibition of or impaired heat production Excessive heat loss Hypoglycaemia Hypothermia Infection Energy-rich nutrients are required to fuel heat production and these are derived from body energy reserves deposited before birth and from colostrum/milk drunk after birth 19-21. Starvation or inadequate colostrum/milk intakes lead to hypoglycaemia as body energy reserves become depleted, and the onset of hypoglycaemia in such newborns may be more rapid in intensive care units because the warm conditions would usually inhibit shivering and its glucose-sparing effects 19. Severe hypoglycaemia in warm conditions will eventually lead to cerebral compromise as indicated by seizure activity, while in cold conditions it will inhibit heat production and usually lead to hypothermia 7, 19. In addition, it is well known that starvation deprives newborns of immunoglobulins and thus predisposes them to infections that can result in a variety of debilitating, often fatal, conditions 7. The routine intensive management of NMS foals is obviously directed at specifically minimising such problems. Interestingly, the volumes of colostrum required to meet the newborn's energy needs 19 will substantially exceed the minimum necessary to provide sufficient immunoglobulins for reasonable protection against many neonatal infections. As already mentioned, NMS is commonly associated with encephalopathy due to cerebral hypoxia and ischaemia shortly before, during or after birth. However, it has been suggested that in some mild cases of NMS, where a normal birth has apparently occurred and the NMS newborns have recovered quickly and fully from the condition, other factors may be at play 2. In particular these may include a post natal persistence of fetal physiological conditions linked to aberrant activity of the fetal HPA axis and/or elevated pregnane concentrations 2. This intriguing suggestion raises the possibility that factors other than hypoxia may impair or delay the onset of consciousness after birth of some NMS foals. If so, this would reduce their capacity to engage in survival-critical volitional behaviour, and this would be the case whether they were kept outdoors or indoors in a stall or a neonatal care unit. It also emphasises the value of developing interventions that would help caregivers to more effectively manage this transitional period in such foals. Integrated analyses of the literature suggest that ungulate fetuses, which are neurologically mature at birth, are actively maintained in sleep-like, unconscious states despite the fact that their brains have attained the capacity for conscious perception before birth 9-11, 22. Maintenance of such unconscious states is apparently due to the combined neuroinhibitory effects of high circulating and cerebral concentrations of adenosine, allopregnanolone, pregnanolone and prostaglandin D2 acting together with a placental neuroinhibitory peptide, warmth, buoyancy and cushioned tactile stimulation 9-11 (Table 2). Therefore, conscious perception is not anticipated to occur until shortly after birth in these species. Potent neuroinhibitor promoting sleep and unconsciousness Responds rapidly due to very short biological half-life Demonstrated inhibition of cerebral cortical electrical activity Placental and fetal tissues including the brain High circulating levels in fetus Production varies with fetal oxygen status – elevated in hypoxia, reduced in normoxia Allopregnanolone Pregnanolone Neuroactive steroidal metabolites of progesterone Act via GABAA receptors to bring about sedative/hypnotic and anaesthetic effects Produced by the fetal brain and the placenta from progesterone and cholesterol High circulating levels in fetus Elevated during stress and hypoxia Produced by the fetal brain Present in cerebrospinal fluid in fetal sheep during late pregnancy These observations raise the question of how the post natal onset of consciousness is achieved in healthy newborns. Key factors are considered to include a reduction in cerebral cortical inhibition by factors that are unique to life in utero, as well as to an increase in cerebral cortical activation associated with birth 9, 10. Thus, a marked elevation of tissue oxygen concentrations in response to the onset of successful breathing after birth and the loss of the placenta as a source of circulating adenosine are both considered to lead to a rapid decrease in circulating and cerebral adenosine concentrations and to a decrease in an overriding adenosine inhibition of cerebral cortical function 9. Loss of the placenta at birth would also contribute by removing a significant source of allopregnanolone, pregnanolone and their precursors, and the only source of the placental peptide neuroinhibitor. The rapid post natal removal of this neuroinhibition, especially that due to adenosine, is presumed to allow a suite of activators of cerebral cortical function to operate. The combined effect of these activators is presumed to be sufficient to overcome residual but declining inhibitory effects of the neuroactive steroids which persist for some time after the rapid decline in the overriding adenosine inhibition has occurred 9, 23. Activators of arousal observed in newborns include high circulating levels of 17β-oestradiol, which is mostly of placental origin, and stimulation of the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system by strong intrapartum tactile stimulation and hypoxia and by post partum exposure to cold ambient conditions 24, 25. The neuroactive steroid 17β-oestradiol has rapid-onset excitatory effects in a variety of brain areas 26, 27. The locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system extends noradrenergic nerves widely throughout the brain and has major roles in stimulating arousal and alert vigilance 28. In addition, neurons of the locus coeruleus project to the olfactory bulb so that activation of this nucleus may facilitate teat-seeking and bonding in neonatal animals 29, 30. With the successful onset of breathing after birth, 17β-oestradiol and noradrenaline presumably act together with cold stimulation of cutaneous thermoreceptors, and with tactile stimulation through contact with hard surfaces and maternal licking, to promote the first appearance of consciousness 9, 10. Arousal is observed in the normal healthy newborn within minutes of birth and accompanies the onset of breathing 31. This is followed by volitional behaviours suggestive of some level of conscious perception, such as interactions with the dam, standing successfully and then teat seeking. Arousal and the associated onset of breathing are essential for survival; in their absence the newborn will rapidly become hypoxic/hypercapnic and die 31. In addition, behaviours of the newborn that contribute to mother–young bonding and help to secure adequate colostrum/milk intake are equally important when human intervention is not possible 7, 19. Behaviours associated with survival become possible by the time of birth in precocial young because their neurological apparatus has developed sufficiently to process sensory inputs from the environment, allowing them to find the dam and a teat, or even to seek shelter in cold conditions 31. Such behaviours, which may initially reflect innate drives, are indicative of arousal and the onset of consciousness. Factors associated with hypothermia that adversely affect this process and thereby threaten newborn survival include the pathophysiological states listed in Table 1. Relationships between these factors and associated key features of NMS foals have been summarised in Figure 1. Clearly, NMS foals are usually managed clinically in ways designed to minimise these problems 2. The point here, of course, is to clarify whether or not a possible delay in the progression from prenatal unconsciousness to post natal consciousness occurs independently of hypoxia in some NMS foals, a condition that would manifest functionally as retention of an inhibited state of fetal cerebral cortical activity as suggested by Aleman et al. 2. Such a demonstration is made somewhat more complex because persistent hypoxia also delays the usually rapid post natal reduction in adenosine inhibition of cerebral cortical activity 9, 11. Intersection between some key features of neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS) foals and hypoxia, hypothermia, starvation, hypoglycaemia and state of consciousness. See text for details. For example, many of the foals showing clinical signs of CNS impairment are likely to have experienced one or both of 2 forms of hypoxic insult. They are chronic hypoxia caused by placental insufficiency associated with a small placental size or other placental impairments that reduce its oxygen transfer capacity over an extended period, and acute hypoxia during birth resulting from dystocia and/or premature separation of the placenta. Interestingly, 12 of the 32 NMS foals observed by Aleman et al. 2 were reported to have had a clinical history of acute hypoxia of these types. Nevertheless, the aetiology of hypoxic influences on the state of consciousness and on commonly observed behaviour in NMS foals, such as lack of affinity for the mare, absence of sucking and weakness 4, is likely to be quite complex. This is because such influences probably involve at least 2 factors acting separately or together. First, where neonatal breathing is not compromised, persistent inhibitory effects of prepartum or intrapartum hypoxia on heat-producing mechanisms would often lead to hypothermia which has the capacity to dull consciousness due to its specific thermal effects on cerebral metabolic rate 7. Of course, providing sufficient thermal support to maintain normothermia would rule out this possibility. The second factor is a subtle involvement of hypoxia in some mild cases of NMS which appear to manifest as a post partum continuation of an inhibited fetal cerebral cortical status, or a reversion to such a state after apparently normal post natal arousal and activity have occurred 2. This might arise if respiratory function remained suboptimal from birth or if such suboptimal function appeared after a successful post partum onset of optimal function. In either case, the potent neuroinhibitory effects of adenosine and/or the pregnane steroid metabolites allopregnanolone and pregnanolone might be anticipated to persist straight after birth or return later, because their concentrations are reported to increase during hypoxia and other stressful situations 11, 32. If this did occur, such inhibition might override activation of cerebral cortical activity resulting from 17β-oestradiol, noradrenaline, strong tactile stimulation and, if thermal support is not provided, by cold exposure. This possibility could be ruled out and/or managed by continuous monitoring of oxygen status and, if required, by providing respiratory support. A third possibility, which accords with the proposal of Aleman et al. 2, is that a post natal persistence or return of a fetal state of cerebral cortical inhibition may occur in normoxic NMS foals. Of the 32 NMS foals in their study, there was no clinical history of hypoxia in 12. However, clarifying the aetiology of NMS in 6 of these was somewhat complicated by other clinically significant factors, whereas the remaining 6 foals apparently exhibited none 2. It is understood of course that heterogeneity of study groups is usual when they are made up of clinical cases acquired serendipitously. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the group of 32 NMS foals provides interesting information 2. First, the plasma neuroactive steroid concentrations exhibited far greater ranges in the NMS foals than in healthy ones. This presumably reflected their heterogeneity and raises the possibility that some of the subgroups considered above might be found to have significantly different hormone profiles once they have been identified and studied in sufficient numbers. Second, progesterone, as a precursor of allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, has neuroinhibitory actions 8, 9, 11 and is therefore of particular interest here because, to the present authors' knowledge, none of the other steroids reported to be significantly elevated in NMS foals 2 have documented neuroinhibitory actions. The elevated plasma concentrations of progesterone are consistent with dulled consciousness 33-35, but the exceptionally low, and therefore unreported 2 concentrations of allopregnanolone are not. Third, although the mechanisms remain elusive at present 2, the significantly higher mean plasma concentrations of pregnenolone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and epitestosterone, as well as progesterone, do indicate different patterns of steroidogenesis and/or clearance, and support the view of Aleman et al. 2 that after further investigation and validation such hormone profiles might become useful aids to diagnosing some types of NMS. Fourth, the behavioural evidence of cerebral cortical inhibition in NMS foals 2, considered in the context of an apparent requirement for the withdrawal of neuroinhibition to be accompanied by increasing neuroactivation if birth is to be followed by the timely onset of consciousness 9-11, raises the prospect of testing the therapeutic efficacy of potent neuroactivators in some NMS foals. One candidate is 17β-oestradiol because of evidence that it could promote behavioural arousal, breathing and subsequent survival in lambs that were initially 'flat' or inactive after delivery by hysterectomy close to the time of normal birth 36. Another candidate is the use of strong tactile stimulation to elicit locus coeruleus–noradrenaline mediated neuroactivation. A suggested way to achieve such tactile stimulation (J.E. Madigan, personal communication) is to use a modified soft rope 'squeeze' technique to simulate compression of the young by the cervix and vagina during birth 37, a natural process that is known to strongly stimulate the locus coeruleus 9, 11. It is apparent from these observations that the fresh perspectives provided by the notion that inhibited fetal states of cerebral cortical function may persist or return after birth in some NMS foals, as outlined by Aleman et al. 2, lays open several fruitful lines of investigation. In building on earlier insights into the onset of consciousness in other neurologically mature young shortly after an uneventful birth 9-11, 31, such investigations, as is usual in their early stages, are likely to constructively generate more interesting questions than they provide answers, but answers do eventually become clear. So, watch this space!",

These cases have been diagnosed as Bell's Mania, typhomania, acute delirious mania (manic-depressive psychosis), delirium grave, acute delirium, specific febrile delirium, and collapse delirium. (2) Luther Bell described these cases in 1849 and the description is slightly modified as follows: There is a sudden onset; exceedingly great overactivity; marked sleeplessness; great push of speech with statements that are disconnected at times by reason of the rapidity of flow; disconnected and poorly systematized delusions; transient hallucinations that border on illusions; appearance of confusion, but when one insists that the patient answer the questions, the patient can \"suspend the intellectual wanderings\" long enough to answer correctly as to orientation. The course of the illness is from three to six weeks, with a fatal termination in a large percentage of cases, apparently from cardio-vascular failure due to overactivity. The cases that recover have no after symptoms. No pathological evidence of note has been found by later workers. (3) Treatment is recommended in the form of sufficient sedative, regardless of the dosage, to enable the patient to get some rest. In our case ordinary sedatives failed and though over 125 grains of sodium amytal were given in three days the patient slept comparatively little. However, the overexcitement was quelled. (4) For the sake of clarity in the studying of this group, and until more definite findfngs are brought forth, it is suggested that these cases be called Bell's Mania, after the original observer.",

      "abstract": "L'etat depressif est susceptible d'entrainer l'apparition de modifications neurocognitives, telles que des baisses de performance touchant l'attention, les fonctions executives et la memoire de rappel. Un certain nombre de modifications observees sont de type dynamique dont certaines variables peuvent etre considerees comme des variables de trait et d'autres des variables d'etat. L'alteration des fonctions cognitives est souvent associee a une intensite symptomatique plus elevee. Certaines des anomalies cognitives persistent au-dela de l'episode depressif, representant des caracteristiques fondamentales de type trait. Il est important d'evaluer les fonctions cognitives des patients apres le retour a l'equilibre de l'humeur pour permettre de mieux caracteriser l'evolution et la nature des symptomes non affectifs associes au trouble depressif. La performance en memoire episodique des sujets âges deprimes a ete retrouvee proche de celle de temoins apparies en âge, la plainte en memoire des patients depend de l'intensite de leur depression. Un deficit des fonctions d'attention ou de memoire immediate est susceptible d'interferer avec la plupart des actions et comportements de la vie de tous les jours. Les patients deprimes en phase symptomatique manifestent davantage d'erreurs d'attention par comparaison avec des temoins apparies. Les meta-analyses rappellent l'existence d'un deficit des processus requerant un effort dans les etats depressifs. Les baisses de performance observees dans les fonctions executives chez des patients souffrant d'etat depressif seraient liees a un dysfonctionnement des regions ventro-medianes et des parties dorsales du cortex cingulaire anterieur. Les lobes frontaux contiennent le recuperateur et la mise en jeu des strategies de recherche et de recuperation de cette information apres que celle-ci a ete verifiee, ils sont le siege d'un dysfonctionnement chez le patient deprime.",

The etiology remains unclear, but there may be a genetic predisposition (haplotype HLA-DR1), associated with environmental factors [6,7]. The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

In addition to classical CIDP, there are many variant presentations, so-called atypical forms, such as pure motor, pure sensory, regional (restricted to the upper or lower limbs), multifocal (Lewis-Sumner syndrome), and distal patterns.2 The diagnosis of CIDP can be established when patients meet carefully delineated clinical, electrodiagnostic, and laboratory criteria,1,2 but may be more challenging in cases with atypical presentations. Further difficulties arise when nerve conduction studies are inadequately performed or trivial nerve conduction abnormalities are labeled demyelinating. Misdiagnosis of CIDP leads to inappropriate and often long-term use of corticosteroids and IV immunoglobulin (IVIg), with the potential for adverse effects and an enormous financial burden to the health care system.",

The aim of the study was to identify the neuropsychological profile of these patients (N = 28) in basic tests of the functional domains episodic memory and orientation, immediate memory, visuo-constructive performance and non-verbal logical thinking, psychomotor speed, letter fluency (FAS) and serial subtraction. If all patients with alcohol or drug abuse or comorbid neurological disorder are excluded, a deficit, compared to a well matched control group, is found only in verbal fluency and the first of two probes of episodic memory. There was a normal performance in digit span, nonverbal logical thinking and a drawing task. As explanation of the deficit pattern the hypothesis of a disorder of frontal functions is considered. The frontal type neuropsychological deficits may be caused by a disturbance of frontal cortico-subcortical loops for which a disturbance of neuronal net function is discussed.",

The disorders associated with behaviors while asleep (parasomnias) are: sleep terrors and sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder. Injury can result from behaviors that occur during sleep. The patient's ability to recall the episode depends partly on the type of the parasomnia (occurrence during non-REM versus REM sleep). The other sleep disorders are recurrent hypersomnia and insomnia. Insomnia can result from multiple causes including psychiatric or general medical disorders, medication effects, substance abuse, and other sleep disorders. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is another important cause of insomnia. RLS is thought to be related to periodic limb movement disorder and is characterized by lower extremity dysesthesias that occur at rest.",

It therefore represents a more severe subset of epilepsy, which can be generally characterized as frequent or severe seizures leading to cerebral dysfunction. This disturbance in cerebral functioning can in turn hinder, somewhat dramatically, cognitive development and further impact the future lives of patients. In this paper, we describe the cognitive consequences of status epilepticus in children and in adults in the context of plasticity theories. Recent studies maintain that consequences of SE may be severe cognitive sequelae, especially in early life. Since the residual consequences of SE in adulthood seem less detrimental and long-lasting, we argue that early life insults, such as those created by SE, during a rapid period of development and functional specialization, result in specific cognitive deficits dependent on the sensitive period at which SE occurred.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Wilson's disease (WD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that presents mainly with liver symptoms, but may be accompanied by various neurological manifestations. WD can be successfully treated with chelators or zinc salts to correct the abnormal copper metabolism, which usually improves both liver function and the neurological deficits; however, improvement in neurological deficits can take years. Patients may initially present with severe neurological deficits that affect activities of daily living. Consequently, therapy to alleviate the neurological symptoms is needed. Treatment choices are often based on experience with other disorders with symptoms clinically similar to WD.Areas covered: Apart from general recommendations on the anti-copper therapy and liver transplantation in patients with WD, no guidelines for managing the neurological symptoms exist. Based on mainly case reports, this review describes the most frequent neurological symptoms and their possible treatments.Expert opinion: There is no strong evidence regarding treatment of neurological disturbances in patients with WD. Several case studies indicate that drugs used to treat movement disorders such as tremor, parkinsonism, or dystonia may also alleviate these symptoms in patients with WD. In the case of severe, disabling, neurological symptoms, the treatment options for symptoms should always be discussed with the patient.",

Many pathological processes have been described, including: the Shy-Dragger syndrome, Parkinson's disease, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, multisystemic atrophy, in relation to certain antidepressant drugs, and most frequently the idiopathic form.We present two cases, one diagnosed as olivopontocerebellar atrophy and another in which there were no pathological findings. Both were referred to our department for the study of possible sleep disorders. In both cases neurophysiological studies, basically polysomnography with monitorization of various muscle groups and video, led to the diagnosis.We discuss the diagnostic and physiological criteria, and physiopathological explanations of each case, with special reference to N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) and non-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (non-NMDA) receptors.

The phenomenon 'sleep days' is not uncommon in nursing homes. Here, we describe a woman who, for months, slept for 3 days and nights in a row and thereafter was awake for 3 days and nights. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed slow background activity and increased delta activity. No epileptiform activity was detected. Polysomnography showed a severely disturbed, markedly fragmented sleep pattern. On her death, neuropathology revealed degeneration and loss of neurons along with α-synuclein-containing Lewy body inclusions and neurites in the substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, hypothalamus, and neocortex, thus fulfilling the criteria of DLB, cortical type. We propose that the hypothalamic degeneration contributed significantly to the clinical profile in this case. We suggest that patients with sleep days should be investigated for other DLB signs.",

      "abstract": "Ring (20) chromosome epilepsy syndrome is characterized by highly refractory epilepsy that is often associated with non-pathognomonic, electroencephalographic (EEG) changes. Seizures typically begin during the stage of childhood around the age of 6 years. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is the most common seizure types and is distinguished by a long-lasting, confusional state that is often associated with EEG patterns in the form of prolonged, high-voltage slow waves with occasional spike/sharp components. Patients with this syndrome suffer from intractable seizures with cognitive decline and frequent epileptic episodes. Accompanying features of this rare disorder, such as superficial minor dysmorphic abnormalities if any, mental retardation and behavioral changes are quite variable. Because of the variability in clinical presentation, in particular the lack of clear dysmorphic features, the clinical diagnosis of this disorder can be delayed before being diagnosed genetically. Most patients with this syndrome have chromosomal changes in the form of a mosaic. High levels of mosaicism correlate well with a lower age of onset and severe cognitive impairment. Here, we emphasize the importance of early G-banding chromosomal analysis when patients present with unexplainable severe seizures and repetitive NCSE, even in the absence of any dysmorphic features suggestive of a chromosomal disorder.",

      "abstract": "The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a type of parasomnia manifested by vivid, often frightening dreams associated with motor behaviors during REM sleep, sometimes causing injuries to patients themselves or to their bed partners. The polysomnographic features of RBD include increased muscle activity during REM sleep (REM sleep without atonia). The majority of RBD-affected persons are older men. The disorder might be idiopathic (iRBD) or secondary to neurological disorders of various kinds. iRBD management with pharmaceutical measures is usually straightforward and effective. Several longitudinal studies have revealed that a high proportion of iRBD patients convert to α-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy body disease (DLB). Considering this, many studies have been conducted to identify common clinical markers between α-synucleinopathies and iRBD or indicators for the future development of α-synucleinopathies in iRBD patients. In this context, electroencephalographic (EEG) slowing occurring while awake and asleep, which is frequently observed in DLB, has received much attention. Clarification of the association between EEG slowing and the presence of mild cognitive impairment, which is also commonly seen in early stages of DLB, has been particularly expected to offer a breakthrough for the identification of cases which might convert to α-synucleinopathies. In this article, we introduce the progress in quantitative EEG research in iRBD during the past decade. We also discuss the relationship between EEG findings and cognitive decline as well as the mechanisms of EEG changes or cognitive abnormalities in patients with the disorder.",

The broad spectrum of underlying causes in these patients cuts across many specialties, which often results in diagnostic challenges. For patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for acute vestibular syndrome (AVS, i.e., presenting with acute-onset prolonged vertigo/dizziness with accompanying gait imbalance, motion intolerance, nausea/vomiting, with or without nystagmus), the typical differential diagnosis is vertebrobasilar stroke and acute unilateral vestibulopathy. However, other disorders may also present with AVS. These include non-neurological causes such as drug side-effects or intoxication, electrolyte disturbances, cardiac disease, severe anemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, endocrine disorders and others. Other non-stroke neurological disorders may also present with AVS or episodic vertigo/dizziness, including demyelinating CNS diseases, posterior fossa mass lesions, acute thiamine deficiency and vestibular migraine. Furthermore, acute physiological abnormalities (e.g., hypotension, fever, severe anemia) may unmask previous vestibular impairments that had been well-compensated. Here, we review the diagnostic approach to patients with acute-onset dizziness in the emergency room and discuss the most important differential diagnoses beyond stroke and acute unilateral vestibulopathy.",

Patients with personality disorders, in particular of the dramatic cluster, may present functional frontolimbic abnormalities. May these neurobiological vulnerabilities linked to a premorbid personality disorder predispose or represent a risk factor to subsequently develop a neurodegenerative disorder? Are subjects with personality disorders more at risk to develop a dementia than mentally healthy subjects? This topic is discussed presenting the clinical case of a patient who suffered of a probable Narcissistic Personality Disorder and subsequently developed a clinically diagnosed Frontotemporal Dementia.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally characterized by the cardinal motor symptoms of tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and impairments of posture, gait, and balance. A relatively new focus of research and treatment is the nonmotor symptoms of the disease, following from recent understanding of the neuropathological stages. Disruptions of arousal, mood, sleep, and autonomic function before the first motor signs of PD implicate the lower brainstem, which is affected before the substantia nigra and dopaminergic system. In later stages of the disease, the pathology extends to the cortex, accompanied by impairments in cognition and perception. The articles in this special section advance our knowledge of the brain bases of the nonmotor symptoms of PD, including disrupted visual perception, impaired cognition across a range of domains, and psychiatric and artistic manifestations. Subtypes under investigation include those described by side of disease onset (left or right body side), predominant cognitive profile, and gender. Taken together, the articles in this special section reflect the field's growing focus on the nonmotor symptoms of PD, their brain bases, and the corresponding potential for their treatment.",

      "abstract": ".The appearance of language or behavioral regression in previously normal children is a devastating experience for both the family and the patients. In some cases, evaluation with prolonged sleep electroencephalograms (EEGs) reveals a dramatic activation of epileptiform activities. These may be continuous and diffusely appearing spike-wave discharges in slow-wave sleep, also known as \"electrical status epilepticus in sleep\" (ESES), or they may be more focal but very frequent temporal, centrotemporal, or multifocal spikes. The typical syndromes are the encephalopathy associated with ESES or continuous spike waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS) and Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS). A significant minority of children with pre-existing impairments in sociability, communication, and behavior, typical of autistic spectrum disorders, may manifest epileptiform abnormalities, which perhaps further exacerbate the language or neuropsychiatric dysfunction. Patients with autistic regression with epileptiform EEGs (AREE) may have clinical and electrographic similarities with CSWS or LKS children. In this review, we will summarize the existing knowledge about these syndromes and the existing therapeutic strategies. Awareness about these syndromes is of paramount importance in order to implement early detection and treatment, which may ameliorate the outcome.",

The clinical syndrome of primary progressive aphasia corresponds to the gradual onset and worsening of language dysfunction in patients who otherwise remained independent for many years in daily living activities, insight, judgement and behaviour. Characteristically, memory and other neuropsychological functions are relatively spared. Brain imaging studies indicate cortical atrophy of the left temporal region, and measures of regional cerebral metabolism show localized deficit in the corresponding region. Other progressive focal disorders due to degenerative cortical diseases have been also reported. In each case, localized atrophy and hypometabolism were observed, depending on the nature of the neuropsychological deficit. The underlying histology of focal cortical degeneration is heterogeneous, suggesting that these slowly progressive disorders represent either atypical variants of DAT or Pick's disease, or distinct neurological entities characterized by spongiform change and astrocytic gliosis.",

Chronotype, which represents individual preferences for activity and performance, is associated with human health issues, particularly psychiatric disorders. This narrative review, which focuses on the relationship between chronotype and mental disorders, provides an insight into the potential mechanism. Recent evidence indicates that (1) the evening chronotype is a risk factor for depressive disorders and substance use disorders, whereas the morning chronotype is a protective factor. (2) Evening chronotype individuals with bipolar disorder tend to have more severe symptoms and comorbidities. (3) The evening chronotype is only related to anxiety symptoms. (4) The relationship between chronotype and schizophrenia remains unclear, despite increasing evidence on their link. (5) The evening chronotype is significantly associated with eating disorders, with the majority of studies have focused on binge eating disorders. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms or influence factors are described in detail, including clock genes, brain characteristics, neuroendocrinology, the light/dark cycle, social factors, psychological factors, and sleep disorders. These findings provide the latest evidence on chronotypes and psychiatric disorders and serve as a valuable reference for researchers.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Conversion disorder (CD) is sometimes accompanied by motor and sensory impairments, such as muscle weakness, paralysis, sensory hypersensitivity, and sensory loss. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) complicates 5-10% of cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients with SS or SLE present with various neurological symptoms and psychiatric manifestations. When neurological symptoms are present, it is important to distinguish whether the symptoms are caused by a neurological or a mental disorder because the former requires early intensive intervention, such as methylprednisolone pulse therapy (MPT), whereas psychotherapy or antidepressant drugs are recommended for mental disorders. We noticed SS- and SLE-like symptoms just after a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in a 14-year-old girl. At approximately the same time, paralysis started in her lower limbs and subsequently spread to her upper limbs. An examination for neurological symptoms revealed no abnormalities. Because of the conversion reaction between her neurological symptoms and her disease state, CD was suspected as the etiology of her physical symptoms. Nevertheless, because of the progressive nature of the neurological symptoms, MPT was initiated with concurrent administration of intravenous immunoglobulin, but it failed to achieve a good outcome. The patient's symptoms eventually improved after she underwent psychotherapy treatment for a few months. Because early diagnosis of the cause of neurological symptoms accompanying SS and SLE is difficult, it may be necessary to combine the two lines of treatment in the early stages. However, when a mental disorder is suspected, psychotherapy should be started early to minimize the use of unnecessary neurological treatment.",

However, the sleep-wake rhythm may be out of sync with the light-dark cycle or endogenously out of sync, resulting in insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in activities of daily living. Sleep disorders are classified by the American Sleep Disorders Association, as intrinsic dyssomnias, extrinsic dyssomnias, parasomnias, or medical/psychiatric sleep disorders. Circa¬dian sleep disorders have been categorized separately to recognize that in most cases the etiology of circadian dis¬turbances is a mix of internal and environmental factors or a temporary mismatch between the two. Symptoms are usually insomnia or hypersomnia, common symptoms in patients with circadian sleep disorders although other causes can be attributed and must be excluded before a diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder is made. In the patient without other sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool in assessing circadian sleep disorders. These records should be kept for 2 weeks or more, as a disturbance due to job changes or travel across time zones can have effects on sleep and daytime alertness weeks after the event.

      "abstract": "Introduction Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a neuroinflammatory condition that often presents with psychiatric symptoms, such as psychosis, mood disturbances, and cognitive impairment, mimicking psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These symptoms frequently appear before neurological signs, complicating diagnosis and delaying treatment. Early recognition of this condition is fundamental to improve patients outcomes. Objectives This review examines the psychiatric manifestations of AE, highlights challenges in differentiating AE from primary psychiatric disorders, and emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. Methods A nonsystematic review of literature focusing on the psychiatric presentation of AE. Results AE often presents with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, agitation, and mood disturbances, frequently leading to misdiagnoses such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. In particular, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is associated with severe psychiatric manifestations like psychosis. Diagnosis is based on recognizing the rapid progression of psychiatric symptoms, along with seizures or other neurological signs, and confirming the autoimmune cause through specific autoantibody tests. Early treatment is essential to reverse these psychiatric symptoms. However, delayed diagnosis can result in persistent cognitive and psychiatric difficulties even after treatment. Diagnosing the psychiatric manifestations of AE is challenging due to their overlap with primary psychiatric disorders. However, the rapid onset and progression of symptoms, combined with neurological signs, should prompt clinicians to consider an autoimmune origin. Autoantibodies, particularly those against NMDA receptors, disrupt neurotransmitter systems, explaining the psychiatric features of AE. While psychotropic medications may provide temporary symptom relief, they do not target the underlying immune dysfunction. Timely immunotherapy significantly improves outcomes, and multidisciplinary collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists is crucial for comprehensive patient care. Conclusions AE should be considered in cases of acute psychosis, mood disturbances, or cognitive impairment. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to preventing long-term psychiatric and neurological issues. Greater awareness of AE’s psychiatric presentations aids in distinguishing it from primary psychiatric disorders and facilitates timely treatment. Further research is needed to explore the neuroimmune mechanisms behind AE and optimize treatment. Collaborative efforts between psychiatry and neurology are essential for successful patient outcomes. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "The effects of environmental chemicals, drugs, and physical agents on the developing kidney are influenced by the state of renal development and maturation. The development of the kidney, the major excretory organ after birth, consists of 3 stages: the pronephros, or cervical kidney; mesonephros, or thoracic kidney; and metanephros, or abdominal kidney, the definitive kidney. In humans, nephrogenesis and organogenesis occur from the 6th to the 36th weeks of gestational age. After 36 weeks, nephrogenesis is complete and each kidney has a full complement of nephrons. The extent of chemical-induced renal toxicity is related, in part, to the efficiency in which the particular compound is transported by renal tubules. Because renal tubular transport capacities vary with maturation, the degree of nephrotoxicity may also vary with maturation. The signs and symptoms of nephrotoxicity can appear acutely or insidiously. Unexplained acute renal failure, chronic mild proteinuria, or even hypertension can be a manifestation of nephrotoxic agents. Species differences occur, thus the need for studies in humans.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common feature in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other α-synucleinopathies as 80% of PD patients develop dementia within 20 years. Early cognitive changes in PD patients present as a dysexecutive syndrome, broadly characterized as a disruption of the fronto-striatal dopamine network. Cognitive deficits in other domains (recognition memory, attention processes and visuospatial abilities) become apparent with the progression of PD and development of dementia. In dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) the cognitive impairment develops early or even precedes parkinsonism and it is more pronounced in visuospatial skills and memory. Cognitive impairment in the rarer α-synucleinopathies (multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure) is less well studied. Metabolic brain imaging with positron emission tomography and [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is a well-established diagnostic method in neurodegenerative diseases, including dementias. Changes in glucose metabolism precede those seen on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Reduction in glucose metabolism and atrophy have been suggested to represent consecutive changes of neurodegeneration and are linked to specific cognitive disorders (e.g., dysexecutive syndrome, memory impairment, visuospatial deficits etc.). Advances in the statistical analysis of FDG-PET images enabling a network analysis broadened our understanding of neurodegenerative brain processes. A specific cognitive pattern related to PD was identified by applying voxel-based network modeling approach. The magnitude of this pattern correlated significantly with patients' cognitive skills. Specific metabolic brain changes were observed also in patients with DLB as well as in a prodromal phase of α-synucleinopathy: REM sleep behavior disorder. Metabolic brain imaging with FDG-PET is a reliable biomarker of neurodegenerative brain diseases throughout their course, precisely reflecting their topographic distribution, stage and functional impact.",

      "title": "Neurodegenerative Disease Monitoring Using a Portable Wireless Sensor Device",
      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons in the central nervous system. The disorders are clinically well-defined as a disease-related dementia, Alzheimer's disease the most typical case, or as a movement disorder, Parkinson's disease (PD). The risk of developing these diseases increases significantly with age: Parkinson's disease affects 1% of the population over 65 years of age, rising to 2% for those over 80 years. Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder that often impairs motor skills and speech of the patient. PD is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia) and in extreme cases, loss of physical movement (akinesia). In particular, PD is due to a loss of dopaminergic neurons (related to the neurotransmitter dopamine), and subcortical neurons in the brain. Replacement therapy with dopaminergic drugs (levodopa, pramipexole) effectively reverses all the symptoms and signs of the disease. After a changeable period of time, however, this excellent initial response to dopaminergic treatment is complicated by the appearance of disorders known as motor response complications (MRC). These complications are divided into two main categories: (i) fluctuations in motor response and (ii) the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements known as levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) (Konitsiotis, 2005). Generally, motor fluctuations appear first as a shortening of the initially soft and lasting dopaminergic response. For patients with advanced PD, a few hours after the administration of medication the patient begins to notice the reappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease. This is known as end of dose deterioration or This may happen several times a day, so the patient can actually spend several hours per day in an state. During the short visit with the neurologist, the patient may appear to be well and thus the neurologist misses the symptoms related to wearing off. As a result, changes in the recent drug treatment availability do not take place in time. It is now well known that early treatment of wearing-off fluctuations delay the onset of more severe complications in the future, as well as the appearance of LID. Therefore any strategy that can detect early changes associated with wearing off would provide a valuable clinical tool that would allow early treatment interventions.",

DSM-IV criteria for delirium must include both acute onset and fluctuating symptoms; disturbance of consciousness (including inattention); at least one of the following: disorganised thinking, disorientation, memory impairment or perceptual disturbance; and evidence of a putative causal medical condition. Traditionally, the course has been described as transient in which recovery is likely to be complete if the underlying aetiological factor is promptly corrected or is self-limited. The most common precipitating causes in elderly include sepsis, dehydration and drugs. Work-up for delirium is limited to septic screening, baseline investigations and imaging. Patients with delirium without focal signs and with either evidence for a medical aetiology of delirium or pre-diagnosed dementia are at a very low risk of having focal lesions in their contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. We are presenting an interesting case of delirium with urosepsis whose imaging revealed milliary brain tuberculomas on contrast-enhanced MRI.",

In line with these clinical observations, PD patients display prominent deficit in neuropsychological tests, requiring self-generated and effort-demanding operations. However, recent evidence suggests that this impairment is not generalized: visuo-spatial working memory and attentional set-shifting seem to be selectively impaired in the early stages of the disease. Electrophysiological studies also demonstrate the dysfunction of higher-level visual information processing. In this article, we discuss some current results to show the connection between clinical symptoms and neuropsychological deficits. We also consider dysfunction in underlying neural mechanisms, with particular emphasis on the dysregulation of fronto-striatal circuits. However, it is conceivable that visuo-cognitive impairment in PD reflects dysfunction of neural assemblies, involving basal ganglia, dorsal visual stream, and frontal-prefrontal circuits.",

      "abstract": "This review highlights the current views on and differences and similarities between nocturnal enuresis (NE) in children and nocturia in adults, which might be a guidance to elucidate the missing links in our knowledge. In both conditions, a genetic factor is suspected. Reduced bladder capacity and nocturnal polyuria are the main underlying lower urinary tract-related conditions. There is a link with sleep disorders, although it is not clear whether this is a cause or consequence. Physical and mental health are comprised in both conditions, however, in different ways. In NE, constipation and attention deficit disorder are the most important comorbidities and the effect on mental health and quality of life is mainly through the negative impact on self-esteem. In nocturia, cardiovascular disease and fall injuries are important comorbidities, mainly affecting the older nocturia population; personal distress and depression are consequences of the related poor sleep quality. For both conditions, treatment is often inadequate and a more individualized approach seems to be necessary. The main difference between NE and nocturia seems to be the difference in arousal to bladder stimuli, suggesting that sleep characteristics might be a key factor in these conditions.",

      "title": "Diplopia in Parkinson's disease: Indication of a cortical phenotype with cognitive dysfunction?",
      "abstract": "Background Visual disturbances are increasingly recognized as common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD patients, intermittent diplopia has been found to be associated with the presence of visual hallucinations and the Parkinson's psychosis spectrum. Here, we investigated whether diplopia in PD is associated with other non-motor traits and cognitive impairment. Methods We investigated 50 non-demented PD patients with and without intermittent diplopia and 24 healthy controls for visual disturbances, as well as motor and non-motor symptoms. All participants underwent a neuropsychological test battery; visuospatial abilities were further evaluated with subtests of the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery (VOSP). The two PD patient groups did not differ significantly in age, symptom duration, motor symptom severity, frequency of visual hallucinations, or visual sensory efficiency. Results PD patients with diplopia reported more frequent non-motor symptoms including more subjective cognitive problems and apathy without changes in global cognition measures compared to those without diplopia. PD patients with diplopia had greater impairment in several tests of visuospatial function (pentagon copying p = .002; number location p = .001; cube analysis p < .02) and object perception (p < .001) compared to PD patients without diplopia and healthy controls. By contrast, no consistent group differences were observed in executive function, memory, or language. Conclusions PD patients with diplopia have a greater non-motor symptom burden and deficits in visuospatial function compared to PD patients without diplopia. PD patients with diplopia might be prone to a cortical phenotype with cognitive decline and apathy associated with worse prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Profound congenital or early aquired deafness is one of the most common severe disabilities (1-2/1000 newborns). Approximately 30% of these children have additional functional disabilities (syndromes). Today nearly 400 syndromes are known, and the most common combination of organ dysfunctions are ear and eye- deafblindness. Many deafblind syndromes have additional dysfunctions of the central nervous system (learning disabilities, delayed mental development etc). Since communication to a large extent is based on an intimate interaction between sight and hearing, this dual sensory loss can if not compensated give rise to severe sensory deprivation and communications problems. We will report results from cognitive studies in Usher and Alstrom syndrome and some clinical observations regarding CHARGE syndrome. The etiologies of deafblindness with additional cognitive dysfunctions have to be diagnosed very early in order to enhance basic communication skills and habilitation in children with deafblindness have to be enhance the use of multiple sensory capacities such as hearing, vision, tactile, smell, and taste. The importance of early and correct diagnoses for early intervention will be discussed.",

According to this theory. a primary neurocognitive dysfunction is the core of schizophrenia and underlies symptom formation, The suggested perceptual fragmentation of external stimuli and inability to connect such perceptions with internal schemata is suggested to lead to positive symptoms, while defensive self-restriction and the exhaustion of the mental apparatus lead to negative symptomatology. Objections to this theory include observations (i) that patients with dominant positive symptoms, e.g., delusions, hallucinations, manifest better neurocognitive function and (ii) that typically antipsychotics significantly reduce positive symptoms and thus improve both the clinical picture and the functioning (to the extent it is reduced with positive symptoms) of the patients, yet have little or no effect on negative, e.g., loss of volition, emotional blunting, and neurocognitive symptomatology, e.g., attentional and memory deficit. The literature suggests that neurocognitive symptoms group independently of other symptomatology. It is suggested that there is currently more evidence against than in favor of the 'cognitive dysmetria' theory.",

      "title": "La actividad Alfa frontal en insomnes primarios con dificultad para iniciar el sueño",
      "abstract": "Difficulty in sleep initiation, with or without objective signs, is one of the most frequent complaints in primary insomniacs. The electroencephalographic (EEG) activity characteristic of waking (beta and alpha oscillations) is gradually replaced by the EEG signs of sleep (sleep spindles and theta/delta waves) during the sleep onset period (SOP) in normal subjects. The decrease in fast oscillations occurs at the first signs of stage 1, whereas theta and delta increase occurs later, indicating that waking promoting mechanisms are turned off before sleep-promoting mechanisms are fully started. It could be therefore hypothesized that difficulty in sleep initiation in insomniacs might be due to either a hyperactivation of waking promoting systems, a weakness of sleep promoting mechanisms or an imbalance between them. Quantitative EEG analysis has revealed higher beta during wakefulness, as well as during sleep and lower slow (delta) activity in insomniacs. The presence of alpha activity during cognitive information processing, especially of slow alpha activity in relation to attention, as well as in some pathologies associated to sleep disturbances, has suggested that alpha activity during sleep is a sign of activation; however, alpha activity during sleep has been less studied in insomniacs. Only broad bands have been considered in all of the aforementioned studies, and in almost all of them the analyses were restricted to central regions. It is therefore important to study the entire frequency spectrum of EEG activity in insomniacs. Sleep initiation does not occur simultaneously over the entire cortex but starts as a local process which gradually invades the rest of the cortex, in which the frontal lobes play a crucial role. Frontal and parietal regions are part of an important network involved in attention and conduction of thought. Thus, quantitative analysis of narrow EEG bands and their distribution in the cerebral cortex may contribute to a better understanding of neural mechanisms compromised in etiology of sleep initiation in primary insomnia. The main objective of the present investigation was, therefore, to analyze the spectral power of narrow EEG bands in the 19 derivations of the 10-20 International System during SOP in primary insomniacs with difficulty in sleep initiation. Given that one of the main complaints of insomniacs is the difficulty to initiate sleep and that hyperarousal is one of the factors proposed to be involved in the etiology of insomnia, EEG activity during SOP of the first night in the laboratory was analyzed to control activating effects of surrounding circumstances and isolate permanent EEG characteristics. Subjects were 19-34 years old, right-handed with primary sleep insomnia, which were thoroughly screened via structured psychiatric, medical and sleep interviews and scales. Subjects were younger and the age range was narrower than in other EEG frequency spectral content studies of primary insomniacs to avoid confounding effects of changes in sleep architecture or in EEG generated by development. All patients met the criteria for primary insomnia with sleep onset difficulty and impaired daytime function on three or more nights per week for at least six months and with no medical, psychiatric or neurological conditions; they were not medicated and had no other sleep disorders.

      "abstract": "Abstract The cauda equina is a collection of peripheral nerves in the common dural sheath within the lumbar spinal canal. Cauda equina syndrome, also known as bilateral acute radicular syndrome, usually is caused by a large, sequestered acute disc rupture at L3-4, L4-5, or L5-S1 that produces partial or complete lesions of the cauda equina–lower motor neuron lesions associated with flaccid paralysis, atrophy, and other conditions. Patients usually present with a history of back symptoms that have worsened precipitously. The syndrome includes back pain, bilateral leg pain, saddle anesthesia, bilateral lower extremity weakness, urinary bladder retention, and lax rectal tone. Cauda equina syndrome is rated using Diagnosis-related estimates (DRE) lumbosacral categories VI or VII. Category VI, Cauda Equina–like Syndrome Without Bowel or Bladder Signs, is used when there is permanent bilateral partial loss of lower extremity function but no bowel or bladder impairment. Category VII, Cauda Equina Syndrome with Bowel or Bladder Impairment, is similar to Category VI but also includes bowel or bladder impairment. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ) uses the term cauda equina syndrome with reference to both the thoracolumbar and cervicothoracic spine regions; this usage is unique to the AMA Guides but maintains the internal consistency of the Injury Model, which is the best approach to date for assessing spine impairment.",

También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

The clinical entity of D/EE-SWAS has undergone many changes in nomenclature. Treatments typically consist of one of the three categories: ASMs, benzodiazepines, and hormones (corticosteroids and the peptide adrenocorticotropic hormone or ACTH). The prognosis in D/EE-SWAS is guarded even though nearly all patients experience resolution or significant reduction of the EEG pattern during adolescence. The neuropsychological deterioration seen in D/EE-SWAS is assigned to the nearly continuous epileptiform activity during sleep. Generalized and focal spike–wave discharges may cause a transitory cognitive impairment during specialized testing, with the type of impairment dependent on the lateralization of the discharge. There is increasing evidence that the thalamus may play a crucial role in the generation of D/EE-SWAS.",

      "title": "Conversion Disorder/Functional Neurological Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Conversion disorder (previously called hysteria) describes neurological symptoms such as paralysis, movement disorder, or sudden collapses that are genuine but not related to disease. Although affected patients may appear to have a neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis or epilepsy, no structural disease process is evident, nor are symptoms deliberately feigned. Instead, brain function is disordered; hence, current preference for the term “functional neurological disorder.” Conversion symptoms exist at the interface between neurology and psychiatry and remain a common cause of disability and distress. The conundrum of hysteria was essential to the development of Freudian psychoanalytic theory, which today is only one of many competing hypotheses to explain these intriguing symptoms.",

      "title": "Neurological Soft Signs and Brain Abnormalities in Schizophrenia: A Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Neurological soft signs (NSS) are subtle neurological impairments in sensory integration, motor coordination, balance, and sequencing of complex motor acts. The prevalence of NSS is well over 50% in schizophrenic patients compared to about 5% in healthy controls. About 30% of schizophrenia patients are resistant to treatment. The main reason for not finding better pharmaceutical agents is the inability to elicit the underlying neurophysiological and neuroanatomical basis of schizophrenia. The most common NSS can be divided into three domains: motor coordination, sequencing of complex motor acts, and sensory integration. Here, the neuroimaging correlates of the abovementioned NSS are reviewed. Most of the studies found a negative correlation of NSS subs cores motor coordination and complex motor tasks with the cerebellum, inferior frontal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. There was a negative correlation between cortical thickness and NSS total scores in the left paracentral lobule, precuneus, middle frontal cortex, right inferior temporal cortex, left/right superior parietal cortex. Instead of considering NSS as a mere trait or state markers, its active inclusion in patient management is required to improve patients' quality of life. Future studies on larger cohorts, combining different imaging modalities are needed to elucidate how these factors might relate to each other and contribute to NSS.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Parasomnias are disorders that may appear during sleep with and/or without dreams. To describe them we must take in account a subjective description by the patient and his relatives. Objective measurement of this phenomenology is made with Polysomnography, Electromyography and Holter EKG. Material and Methods: We searched the recent data about parasomnia in the Medline, Pubmed, Google academic databases as also in classic books and reviews. Results: The clinical picture is various from motor and neurological signs to autonomic signs as also sleep related hallucinations. There are more rare presentations with associated disorders due to excretion and involuntary urinary emission during sleep disorders. Parasomnias are often preceded by a traumatic event for the patient and his family members which can be a head trauma or an infection or an intoxication which can be accompanied by psycho vulnerable events. On the other part parasomnias can be themselves a preamble announcing neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson disease, Lewy Body Dementia or some synucleopathies. Conclusions: The fluctuations of neurotransmitters (Dopamine, Serotonine or Acetylcholine) due to specific neurologic pathology can lead to particular parasomnias, their evolution corresponding to each impairment. The knowledge of accompanying parasomnias of neurologic disorders like those from Parkinson disease helps manage diseases of neurological patients already known with Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases, leading to increased quality of life for these patients as a result of specialized intervention.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia requires both a report of poor sleep at night and residual daytime impairment associated with the poor sleep. Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability (SYNGAP1-ID) is characterized by developmental delay (DD) or intellectual disability (ID) (100% of affected individuals), generalized epilepsy (~84%), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other behavioral abnormalities (≤50%). To date more than 50 individuals with SYNGAP1-ID have been reported. In the majority DD/ID was moderate to severe; in some it was mild. The epilepsy is generalized; a subset of individuals with epilepsy have myoclonic astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome) or epilepsy with myoclonic absences. Behavioral abnormalities can include stereotypic behaviors (e.g., hand flapping, obsessions with certain objects) as well as poor social development. Feeding difficulties can be significant in some. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SYNGAP1-ID is established in a proband with developmental delay or intellectual disability in whom molecular genetic testing identifies either a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SYNGAP1 (~89%) or a deletion of 6p21.3 (~11%). Management Treatment of manifestations: DD/ID are managed as per standard practice. No guidelines are available regarding choice of specific antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In about 50% of patients, the epilepsy responds to a single antiepileptic drug (AED); in the remainder it is pharmacoresistant. Children may qualify for and benefit from interventions used in treatment of ASD. Consultation with a developmental pediatrician may guide parents through appropriate behavioral management strategies and/or provide prescription medications when necessary. Nasogastric/gastrostomy feeding may be required for individuals with persistent feeding issues. Surveillance: Monitor seizure manifestations and control; behavioral issues; developmental progress and educational needs. Genetic counseling SYNGAP1-ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date almost all probands with SYNGAP1-ID whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have had a de novo germline pathogenic variant; however, vertical transmission (from a mildly affected, mosaic parent to the proband) has been reported in one family. Thus, while the risk to sibs appears to be low, it is presumed to be greater than in the general population because of the possibility of germline mosaicism in a parent. Once the SYNGAP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

Although these disorders like schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorder appear emotional symptoms negatively for patients, these problems affect humans' nervous system and brain functions directly and then induce epilepsy finally. Especially, the patients have brain abnormalities and cognitive problems. This study identifies the issue neurobiologically more than pathologically or medically as we know. Firstly, schizophrenia causes the nervous system and brain functions such as the cerebrum, cerebellum, white matter, and gray matter. These phenomena are associated with neurotransmitters occurrence even, like dopamine, glutamate, etc. Secondly, depression and anxiety disorder have comparable symptoms physically and mentally. Both affect the digestive system, fatigue, and psychological difficulties. Therefore, people have these disorders in trouble with social activity in particular. Finally, those mental disorders reach epilepsy. The main point of epilepsy is epileptic seizure. The reason for the seizure is mental illness and also the mental disorders produce the epileptic seizure correspondingly. Until now, not able to treat completely the epilepsy yet, but control emotional problems properly is one of the best ways to manage the symptoms of epilepsy.",

All patients had contralateral homonymous hemianopia or hemianesthesia. The three neglect patients showed normal SEPs or VEPs to stimuli delivered to the left half-field or to the left hand, without conscious perception and verbal report of the stimulation. By contrast, the three left-brain-damaged patients without neglect showed no recognizable cortical evoked response to contralateral visual or somatosensory stimuli. In all patients, the cortical evoked responses to ipsilateral stimulation were normal. In patients with spatial hemineglect, hemianopia and hemianesthesia may be manifestations of the neglect syndrome (visual and somatosensory hemi-inattention), rather than representing primary sensory deficit. Visual and somatosensory hemi-inattention may be due to defective access to the neural processes subserving conscious perception by information that has undergone early sensory processing.",

      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

Accurate diagnosis of RBD requires a history of abnormal sleep behaviours and nocturnal video-polysomnographic (VPSG) demonstration of prominent tonic and/or phasic electromyographic activity associated with abnormal vocal and motor manifestations in REM sleep. VPSG is required because dream-enacting behaviours resembling those typically seen in RBD may occur in people affected by obstructive sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder, visual hallucinations, isolated nightmares, confusional awakenings in demented subjects and more rarely by somnambulism and nocturnal epilepsy.

In the last 3 years of his life, he developed multiple neurological deficits, including bilateral chorea, ataxic gait, sensory neuropathy, and progressive dementia. After death from pneumonia, autopsy examination of the patient's brain was most remarkable for a selective loss of neurons from both subthalamic nuclei and Purkinje cell loss in the cerebellum. This pattern of injury is consistent with a toxic process and does not fit previously characterized pathological syndromes known to be associated with movement disorders or dementia or both. Phenytoin has been shown to cause choreiform movements, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive decline in some patients, but the pathological basis for these changes has not been elucidated. The patient's chorea was very likely the result of neuronal loss in the subthalamic nuclei, but causes for his dementia and neuropathy were not found. The pathological findings may represent either an unusual form of chronic phenytoin toxicity or a previously undescribed primary degenerative brain syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) can be a tricky disease to understand. In simple terms, DLB is a combination of dementia and Parkinson disease (PD). Dementia refers to a problem with normal daily activities due to problems thinking (see “About dementia and similar conditions” on the following page). The most common problems in dementia are short-term memory loss, lack of drive, and slowed thinking. PD typically includes a tremor (shaking) that is present at rest, slowed movements, and loss of facial expression. People with PD have a characteristic walk: they are stooped over, don't swing their arms normally, take small, shuffling steps, and may lose their balance.\n\nLewy bodies are seen in brain tissue viewed under the microscope. They are known to be the hallmark of PD. They usually occur in a part of the brain known as the substantia nigra deep within the brain, but also sometimes occur in other brain locations. The significance of Lewy bodies found outside the substantia nigra was not appreciated until recently. Also, Lewy bodies in the brain were previously thought to indicate PD, and nothing else.\n\nAbout 20 years ago, neurologists and neuropathologists (scientists who study the structure of the brain) came to recognize that Lewy bodies were also found in patients with a dementing illness that often had been called Alzheimer disease (AD) when the patient was first diagnosed. New insights led to more careful observations about the distinctive features of DLB. In 1996, Dr. Ian McKeith and coworkers brought together a group of scientists interested in defining DLB.1 Their first publication identified some core features of what they called DLB. These included dementia, parkinsonism (features that look like PD), marked variations in arousal, hallucinations, and extreme sensitivity to antipsychotics (medications used to treat hallucinations and psychosis).\n\nFrom that starting point …",

These events encompass abnormal sleep related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Parasomnias are classified as: 1) disorders of arousal (from non-rapid eye movement, or NREM, sleep); 2) parasomnias usually associated with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep; and 3) other parasomnias. This sleep disorders in childhood are common, and often more frequent than in adults. Clinicians should be aware that many pediatric parasomnias have benign and self-limited nature. Most of the parasomnias may not persist into late childhood or adolescence. Parasomnias in adults often differ in type from childhood parasomnias and may portend significant psychiatric disturbances or neurodegenerative disorders. A reliable diagnosis can often be made from a detailed history from the patient and, if possible, the parents or bed partner. Detailed overnight investigations of parasomnias are usually not required. The non-REM parasomnias are more common in community although REM parasomnias are more likely to be",

      "abstract": "Neurologists frequently see patients with symptoms or inconsistent signs that are not explicable in terms of any recognized neurological disease process. Often it is clear that such symptoms and signs are being manufactured psychologically, either consciously or, more often, by an unconscious process. Such patients are frequently polysymptomatic, and may have a long history of consulting other specialists, particularly abdominal, dental, gynaecological, and otorhinological surgeons. They run the risk of developing secondary abnormalities induced by surgical and other invasive procedures. Psychologically determined symptoms are a very common cause of neurological out-patient referral. Of those with psychogenic disorders, pain is the commonest symptom, followed by motor symptoms, gait disturbances, dizziness, blackouts, sensory symptoms, and visual dysfunction (Lempert et al. 1990). Depressive and anxiety disorders are twice as common in those with psychologically determined disorders and those with emotional disorders have a greater number of somatic symptoms but are unenthusiastic about psychiatric treatment. Clinical syndromes including Briquet’s syndrome, hypochondriasis, conversion disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and pain disorders are explained and described. The presentation and characteristics of malingering (a process of deliberate deceit, in which symptoms are fabricated) is described, including Munchausen’s syndrome. In addition, associated psychiatric states and the symptoms and physical signs of psychologically determined disorders are discussed. Finally, the management and prognosis of psychologically determined states are outlined.",

They also represent a paradigmatic arena to study the etiopathogenic mechanisms underlying suicidality because they are emblematic of the heterogeneity and complexity of mutual interrelationships characterizing this issue. On the one hand, neurological diseases imply strictly biological impairments that are postulated to be the basis of vulnerability to suicide or result in the need for treatments for which a suicidal risk has been hypothesized. On the other hand, they question some subjective experiences of neurological patients, up to near existential positions. Often, in fact, they are accompanied by severe hopelessness. The latter may originate in, particularly for the most severe neurological diseases, the absence of curative treatments, unpredictable disease progression that leads to acute relapses or chronicity, a decrease in autonomy or selfidentity, progressive social isolation, a sense of becoming useless, and perception of feeling stigmatized. This may ultimately cause a slip into experiencing an absurd condition. At the confluence of neurobiology and hopelessness, frequent psychiatric comorbidities may play a primary role. To conclude, neurological patients require special attention from clinicians in form of openly verbalizing and exploring the suicidal thematic, inquiring about protective and risk factors, and promptly initiating both a psychopharmacological treatment and, where possible, psychological support.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

      "abstract": "• Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been linked to altered neurological function following head trauma, encephalitis, abnormal birth events, and Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. Abnormalities in computed tomographic scans, electroencephalograms, positron emission tomographic scans, and evoked potentials have been described in this disorder, but are neither consistent nor pathognomonic of OCD. Neurological soft signs are nonlocalizing signs of deviant performance on a motor or sensory test where no other sign of a neurological lesion is present. We studied 41 medication-free patients with OCD who met<i>DSM-III-R</i>criteria, as well as 20 normal controls, matched for age, sex, and handedness, on 20 individual tasks that involved fine motor coordination, involuntary movements, and sensory and visuospatial function. There were significantly more signs of central nervous system dysfunction in the OCD group, as shown by abnormalities in fine motor coordination, involuntary and mirror movements, and visuospatial function. An excess of findings on the left side of the body and abnormalities of cube drawing may suggest right hemispheric dysfunction in a subgroup of patients with OCD. Soft signs correlated with a severity of obsessions. There was also a correlation between abnormalities in visual memory and recognition on neuropsychological testing and total soft signs. These findings provided additional evidence for a neurological deficit in some patients with OCD. However, further comparisons with other psychiatric populations are needed to determine whether these findings are unique to OCD or are a property of other psychiatric disorders as well.",

      "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is an early ‘pre-clinical’ sign of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this chapter I briefly review what is known about such dysfunction in PD and related diseases. In general, the dysfunction is robust and bilateral, anosmia is not the norm, women exhibit less loss than men, and some monogenetic forms of the disease exhibit the dysfunction. The loss is unrelated to disease stage or magnitude of the motor symptoms, save perhaps in the earliest stages of the disorder. Lewy body pathology, a hallmark of PD, appears to be correlated with the olfactory dysfunction, although it is not known whether this reflects a causal relationship. Dopamine is over-expressed in the olfactory bulbs of PD patients. Interestingly, deficiencies in other neurotransmitters, most notably acetylcholine, are correlated with the olfactory loss. A number of diseases often misdiagnosed as PD have little or no smell loss, including essential tremor, vascular parkinsonism, and progressive supranuclear palsy, making olfactory testing of value in differential diagnosis. The limited data suggest that the physiological basis of PD-related olfactory dysfunction is likely multifactorial, representing a combination of environmentally and genetically determined pathologies that involve multiple transmitter systems.",

      "title": "Neonatal Hypotonia",
      "abstract": "Neonatal hypotonia can be caused by diseases that impair both the central and the peripheral nervous systems; it represents a diagnostic challenge to both the experienced neonatologist and pediatric neurologist because the differential diagnosis is very broad. First, a systematic methodology to collect information on family, pregnancy, and prenatal and birth clinical data is helpful for the diagnostic workup. After the clinical information is gathered, an accurate clinical examination should follow, including neurologic assessment to address differential diagnosis and to avoid needless or invasive diagnostic tests. In newborns and older infants, there is an overlapping significance between tone versus strength and hypotonia versus weakness. Clinical assessment of a floppy infant includes the evaluation of muscle tone, primitive reflexes, deep tendon reflexes, placing reactions, resting postures in prone and supine positions, antigravity movements, and visual following⁄alertness. Moreover, since there is a higher prevalence of cognitive delay in infants with hypotonia of central origin, a standardized assessment of cognitive development and observational assessments of the infant’s affective behavior development are important as well. Generalized hypotonia associated with muscle weakness and preserved social orientation suggests a neuromuscular disorder. Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 and congenital myotonic dystrophy are the most common neuromuscular causes of “floppy infant syndrome.”",

      "abstract": "Optic nerve hypoplasia is a developmental anomaly of the retina and optic nerves in which there is a reduction in the number of ganglion cells in the retina and of their centripetal fibers projecting through the optic nerve to the lateral geniculate body. The condition may be unilateral or bilateral and is frequently misdiagnosed as optic atrophy. In about 25% of cases, bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is associated with a variety of cerebral malformations of which the commonest single disturbance is absence of the septum pellucidum (septo-optic dysplasia). Cerebral malformations and their endocrine accompaniments are also seen, though less frequently, in unilateral hypoplasia. The endocrine disturbances that may accompany optic nerve hypoplasia include growth hormone deficiency, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and disturbances of antidiuretic hormone production. Precocious puberty and hypogonadism have also been observed. The prognosis of optic nerve hypoplasia depends upon the severity of the changes in the optic nerves and especially the degree of associated cerebral malformation. The finding of optic nerve hypoplasia should lead to thorough ophthalmologic, neurologic, and endocrinologic evaluation of the patient. ( J Child Neurol 1986;1:181-188)",

      "abstract": "In recent years, more attention has been given to the early diagnostic evaluation of patients with dementia which is essential to identify patients with cognitive symptoms who may have treatable conditions. Guidelines suggest that all patients presenting with dementia or cognitive symptoms should be evaluated with a range of laboratory tests, and with structural brain imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While many of the disorders reported as 'reversible dementias' are conditions that may well be associated with cognitive or behavioral symptoms, these symptoms are not always sufficiently severe to fulfill the clinical criteria for dementia. Thus, while the etiology of a condition may be treatable it should not be assumed that the associated dementia is fully reversible. Potentially reversible dementias should be identified and treatment considered, even if the symptoms are not sufficiently severe to meet the clinical criteria for dementia, and even if partial or full reversal of the cognitive symptoms cannot be guaranteed. In the literature, the most frequently observed potentially reversible conditions identified in patients with cognitive impairment or dementia are depression, adverse effects of drugs, drug or alcohol abuse, space-occupying lesions, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and metabolic conditions land endocrinal conditions like hypothyroidism and nutritional conditions like vitamin B-12 deficiency. Depression is by far the most common of the potentially reversible conditions. The review, hence addresses the common causes of reversible dementia and the studies published so far.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a neurologic disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and manifestations of disrupted rapid eye movement sleep stage. The pathologic hallmark is loss of hypocretin neurons in the hypothalamus likely triggered by environmental factors in a susceptible individual. Patients with narcolepsy, in addition to excessive daytime sleepiness, can present with cataplexy, sleep paralysis, sleep fragmentation, and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations. Approximately 60% to 90% of patients with narcolepsy have cataplexy, characterized by sudden loss of muscle tone. Only 15% of patients manifest all of these symptoms together. Narcolepsy can be misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder or even epilepsy. An appropriate clinical history, polysomnogram, Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and, at times, cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin levels are necessary for diagnosis. The treatment of narcolepsy is aimed toward the different symptoms that the patient manifests. Excessive daytime sleepiness is treated with amphetamine-like or non-amphetamine-like stimulants. Cataplexy is treated with sodium oxybate, tricyclic antidepressants, or selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and fragmented sleep may be treated with benzodiazepine hypnotics or sodium oxybate. Patients with narcolepsy should avoid sleep deprivation, sleep at regular hours, and, if possible, schedule routine napping.",

      "abstract": "In around 85% of cases, multiple sclerosis (MS) starts with an acute neurological episode, a clinically isolated syndrome, which is considered to be the first clinical episode of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). It is characterised by the presence of acute relapses, after which there is normally good functional recovery. About 15-20 years after symptom onset, most patients develop secondary progressive MS, characterised by a gradual and irreversible neurological decline. MS affects women more frequently than men, with a ratio of 2-3:1. In RRMS the disease generally starts in the late 20s. Symptom onset in those with primary progressive MS occurs around the age of 40. Clinical relapses in RRMS reflect acute inflammation in the CNS, resulting in specific clinical syndromes including optic neuritis, myelitis, brainstem/cerebellum syndrome and supratentorial syndrome. In progressive MS, progression generally presents with gradual loss of power in the lower limbs, which may be asymmetric. It is often accompanied by sensory disturbances in the lower limbs, bladder and bowel symptoms. Investigations need to rule out conditions that can mimic an inflammatory-demyelinating disease of the CNS and determine the presence of dissemination in space and dissemination in time of the inflammatory-demyelinating disease. There is no confirmatory test for MS and it remains essentially a clinical diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cognitive comorbidities are more frequent in children with epilepsy than in the general population. The cognitive function of children with epilepsy should be appropriately screened, and when there is an impairment, it must be diagnosed and managed. Several factors contribute to the occurrence of this comorbidity. The underlying aetiology and epilepsy syndrome are the major risk factors. Other factors also play a role, such as seizure recurrence, antiseizure medication, and interictal abnormalities. Recent evidence also suggested that cognitive involvement is an ongoing process that interacts with the normal maturation of cognitive function in children with epilepsy. Furthermore, some patients experience rapid cognitive deterioration related to epileptic activity, resulting in epileptic encephalopathy. Further research is needed to better understand how to prevent or modify factors that affect cognitive function in children with epilepsy. What this paper adds Cognitive comorbidities are more frequent in children with epilepsy than in the general population. The risk factors for cognitive impairment are the underlying aetiology/syndrome, seizure recurrence, antiseizure medication, and interictal abnormalities. Advanced genetic and neuroimaging studies are useful tools to better understand cognitive impairment in children with epilepsy.",

      "title": "Olfactory dysfunction as a marker of multiple sclerosis progression",
      "abstract": "ultiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and degenerative disease of the central nervous system affecting especially young people, leading to neurological disability and impacting their quality of life.It is a multifaceted disorder, which means a unique disease in each patient.Symptoms that are more frequent and more disabling as motor impairment, incoordination, visual deficit and urinary disorder draw the attention of doctors and patients alike.Meanwhile other symptoms can cause more embarrassment in the MS patients daily life like cognition deficit, sexual disabilities and olfactory dysfunction, which do not have a proper evaluation.Although not well considered, olfaction is essential in everyday activities.The lack of awareness of olfactory deficit in MS patients can underestimates this disorder, which can indicate a subclinical neurodegenerative process.MS patients rarely report smell changes, therefore olfaction was considered to be relatively preserved in MS 1 .However, different studies 2,3,4,5 suggested olfactory loss in those patients but it remains unclear if it is an early symptom of MS as it is in other neurodegenerative diseases as Parkinson´s disease, Alzheimer´s disease and Huntigton´s disease 6,7 .The incidence of olfaction in MS is variable.Different trials found an incidence of 15%, 22% and 38.5% when compared to healthy controls 3,8,9 .In a recent systematic review of the literature 10 searching for olfactory dysfunction in MS patients, forty articles were analyzed and pointed out a variability in reported frequency, but suggested a prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in 20% to 45% of MS population.The disagreement among investigators may arise from different testing methods, small size of the samples, heterogeneity of the study design but it can also be influenced by corticosteroid treatment as smell function can improve during remission and worsen during relapses.Although olfactory impaired function in MS and the inability to identify odor were associated to anxiety, depression and to the degree of neurological incapacity 9 , in several studies 11,12,13 , this association was not found when assessing different qualities of olfaction such as the ability to detect odor threshold, the ability to identify and discriminate the odors.Moreover, each quality of olfaction was related to a different phase of the disease.A worse olfactory threshold was observed in the early inflammatory phases while an identification score was more impaired in the widespread chronic disease.This could be explained by smell threshold being part of the more peripheral regions of the olfactory system while the ability to discriminate and identify odors are attributed to several damaged areas of the brain.When analyzing demyelinating plaques in brain MRI of MS patients 2-5 , the inferior frontal-and temporal-lobe regions, which are involved in olfaction, had a negative relation with smell dysfunction.Considering other brain regions not concerned to olfaction, the number of plaques did not have such relation.Olfactory bulb tract axonal loss was reported in 12 out of 17 MS patients 14 and related to the extension of demyelination in brain, especially in the inferior frontal cortex, although other areas beyond the orbitofrontal cortex are involved in the perception and processing of different odorants, as the insula, cerebellum, visual and cingulate cortex.Therefore, olfactory dysfunction could be an early indication of disease progression, and a marker of widespread disease in the brain.In this issue of Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria Jordy et al. 15 emphasize olfaction dysfunction as a measure of MS disease activity and progression.In a controlled cross-sectional study",

Few authors investigated accurately relationship between implications of these two troubles above, and occurrence or complications of sleep quality. It has been showed that, the quality and the duration of sleep depended strongly on the lifestyle and the personal environment. Knowing that, insomnia and stress are a permanent part of our daily life, a complete exploration of their combined effects on our sleep quality and sleep duration may move forward the general approach of therapist about sleep impairment. Indeed, a complete evaluation should be made continuously on a brain to record all the waves fluctuations related to sleep, but an early detection of factors influencing these changes in cerebral wave may be equally interesting. To our knowledge, none made a clear statement on the combined effects of insomnia and stress on the Sleep Impairment events. The aim of this study is to explore how insomnia and stress together affects sleep quality and sleep duration (SD), in the general population is associated in simultaneous with sleep components, psychological stress, depression, anxiety, well-being, addiction and global health of participants; and if it is also influenced by the sociodemographic profile of each subject. Methods: The present study was led by the questionnaire Mental Health Profile of Etindele (MHPE) incorporating McNair test, and incorporated sub-score for sleep components, psychological stress, depression, anxiety, well-being, addiction, family history of the participant and his family. All this clinical and environmental measure were associated with sociodemographic profile of each participant, to address our question Our results showed that the stress level and sleep duration are comparable per gender and family history. Results: Sleep quality was correlated strongly with decrease of clinical parameters, and the level of stress. the results showed that lack of sleep combined with a low global score to MHPE are strongly correlated with sleep impairment, while score of memory and attention decreased with insomnia. Insomnia is strongly correlated with physical activity. Conclusion: Insomnia and stress together speed up decline of memory and sleep impairments.",

      "abstract": "T HE mysterious disease known as epilepsy, with its cardinal symptoms of convulsions and loss of consciousness, is followed by a variety of mental disturbances, some permanent and others of only a transient character. It seems to make little or no difference whether the individual suffers from the mild or the severer type of convulsions, sooner or later he will show deterioration of the intellect, or the periodic occurrence of graver forms of insanity. Nevertheless, it may be stated as a general rule that the earlier the disease comes on, the greater the liability to mental deterioration and the more rapid the failure, while in those persons in whom the attacks begin in later years of life, the deteriorating process is much slower, owing to the stability of the nerve tracks acquired in infancy and youth. Epileptics who have had fits for years show a dimming of the reasoning faculties, defects of memory, alternations of character, a sinking to a lower plane of intelligence, and above all a tendency to impulsiveness and irritability. To this rule there are but infrequent exceptions. In many instances of the disease the epileptic is irritable even to violence, unmanageable, careless of the feelings of his family and friends, and is among the most difficult of mental cases to handle. As a general rule it may be stated that the more frequent the seizures, the more rapid the mental deterioration. There are, however, cases who have a great many attacks and who hold up mentally in a surprising manner in spite of the frequent assaults on the nervous system; again, there are cases with very infrequent seizures who deteriorate with great rapidity.",

      "abstract": "New-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) is \"a clinical presentation, not a specific diagnosis, in a patient without active epilepsy or other preexisting relevant neurological disorder, with new onset of refractory status epilepticus without a clear acute or active structural, toxic, or metabolic cause.\" Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is \"a subcategory of NORSE that requires a prior febrile infection, with fever starting between 2 weeks and 24 h before the onset of refractory status epilepticus, with or without fever at the onset of status epilepticus.\" These apply to all ages. Extensive testing of blood and CSF for infectious, rheumatologic, and metabolic conditions, neuroimaging, EEG, autoimmune/paraneoplastic antibody evaluations, malignancy screen, genetic testing, and CSF metagenomics may reveal the etiology in some patients, while a significant proportion of patients' disease remains unexplained, known as NORSE of unknown etiology or cryptogenic NORSE. Seizures are refractory and usually super-refractory (i.e., persist despite 24 h of anesthesia), requiring a prolonged intensive care unit stay, often (but not always) with fair to poor outcomes. Management of seizures in the initial 24-48 h should be like any case of refractory status epilepticus. However, based on the published consensus recommendations, the first-line immunotherapy should begin within 72 h using steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, or plasmapheresis. If there is no improvement, the ketogenic diet and second-line immunotherapy should start within seven days. Rituximab is recommended as the second-line treatment if there is a strong suggestion or proof of an antibody-mediated disease, while anakinra or tocilizumab are recommended for cryptogenic cases. Intensive motor and cognitive rehab are usually necessary after a prolonged hospital stay. Many patients will have pharmacoresistant epilepsy at discharge, and some may need continued immunologic treatments and an epilepsy surgery evaluation. Extensive research is in progress now via multinational consortia relating to the specific type(s) of inflammation involved, whether age and prior febrile illness affect this, and whether measuring and following serum and/or CSF cytokines can help determine the best treatment.",

Impairment of motor skills and cognition compromise the patient’s diet, nutrition and ability to maintain proper oral hygiene. As a result dental caries and edentulism seem to be a direct impending predicament. It is important to understand that people with parkinson’s disease start experiencing symptoms later in the course of the disease because a significant amount of the substantia nigra neurons have already been lost or impaired. Lewy bodies (accumulation of abnormal alphasynuclein) are found in substantia nigra neurons of PD patients. In addition to movement-related (motor) symptoms, Parkinson’s symptoms may be unrelated to movement (non-motor). People with Parkinson’s disease are often more impacted by their non-motor symptoms than motor symptoms such as apathy, depression, constipation, sleep behavior disorders, loss of sense of smell and cognitive impairment. Prosthodontics management of patients with parkinson’s disease require diligent handling.Objectives and Methods: A patient with a history of Parkinsons disease for the past 5 years (under medication) visited Saveetha dental college with the chief complaint of broken prosthesis. High impact resin was chosen to be material of choice for this patient due to its high flexural strength.

He was seen by many neurologists and psychiatrists and was treated with diagnosis of conversion reaction. Neurological examination was normal except for subjective sensory loss. Visual acuity was normal on both eyes. Marcus Gunn sign was negative. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP), and lumbar puncture confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Discussion: Multiple sclerosis may present with atypical symptoms and signs and no objective data may be found in neurological examination. Confusion with psychiatric problems has been mentioned in the literature . Physicians must be careful in attributing such symptoms to psychiatric disorders . Above mentioned case is a notable example of such a problem. He presented with simultaneous onset of loss of vision and hemi sensory loss on the same side, which is an anatomical impossibility from a single lesion and mentioned in neurological textbooks a sign of conversion reaction .Also no objective sign was found in neurological examination (negative Marcus Gunn sign and similar visual acuity in both eyes ). Key point that resulted in correct diagnosis was careful sensory examination that revealed organic type of sensory loss (area of sensory loss was lesser than half of the face and body, and shift from painless to pain full area was Para sagittal and not in the midline). We concluded that atypical symptoms and signs must not automatically attribute to conversion reaction and accurate neurological examination is the best way of making correct diagnosis.",

      "title": "Apathy: a neurocircuitry model based on frontotemporal dementia",
      "abstract": "Apathy is a symptom shared among many neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the underlying neurocircuitry remains incompletely understood. Apathy is one of the core features of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a neurodegenerative disease presenting with heterogeneous combinations of socioaffective symptoms and executive dysfunction. We reviewed all neuroimaging studies of apathy in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) attempting to refine a neurocircuitry model and inform clinical definitions. Levels of apathy have been consistently shown to correlate with the severity of executive dysfunctions across a wide range of diseases, including FTD. Some authors view ‘energisation’—the loss of which is central in apathy—as a core executive function. Apathy in FTD is most robustly associated with atrophy, hypometabolism and/or hypoperfusion in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior and middle cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the medial and ventromedial superior frontal gyri. Data also suggest that abnormalities in connecting white matter pathways and functionally connected more posterior cortical areas could contribute to apathy. There is a lack of consistency across studies due to small samples, lenient statistical thresholds, variable measurement scales and the focus on apathy as a unitary concept. Integrating findings across studies, we revise a neurocircuitry model of apathy divided along three subcomponents (cognition/planning, initiation, emotional-affective/motivation) with specific neuroanatomical and cognitive substrates. To increase consistency in clinical practice, a recommendation is made to modify the bvFTD diagnostic criteria of apathy/inertia. More generally, we argue that bvFTD constitutes a disease model to study the neurocircuitry of complex behaviours as a ‘lesion-based’ approach to neuropsychiatric symptoms observed across diagnostic categories.",

      "abstract": "Children and adolescents who are not doing well in school are often referred to physicians for evaluation. Many of these children have average or above-average intelligence but are academically frustrated, low achievers. Parents state that although they are convinced that their child is bright, he or she does not seem to learn, and does not behave acceptably in school and at home. Results of the usual pediatric and neurologic examinations are frequently unrevealing. In evaluating children who are doing poorly in school, the clinician must determine whether the child has a developmental specific learning disorder and whether primary affective illness, disturbed vigilance, or hyperactivity complicates the picture. Children who are intelligent but failing in school frequently manifest either one or several of these conditions. Although there are reasonably well-established criteria for affective illness in children, clinically useful criteria for evaluating the variety of childhood learning problems have not been available. We present criteria for the diagnosis of developmental specific learning disorders and briefly mention some aspects of management and treatment. We also describe a primary disorder of vigilance that becomes manifest in school, worsening the learning and performance process, which is further worsened by affective illness.

It occurs when nerve cells or neurons that produce an important brain channel known as dopamine and control the movements in an area of the brain is impaired and die. Parkinson’s symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over times. Age is the one clear risk factor for this disease. A person with Parkinson’s disease may have clumps of proteins known as alpha synuclein or Lewy bodies in their brain. There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, the aim of medical management of Parkinson’s disease to restore the proper balance of dopaminergic and cholinergic activities in the brain in order to relieve symptoms. This review presents a brief overview of scientific basis that support the plant derived natural products and their constituents for the treatment of underlying neuronal degeneration observed in Parkinson’s disease. The neuroprotective effects exhibited by these medicinal plants and their constituents are considered to be due to their ability to modulate; glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase in the brain, which all are disrupted in the PD brain.

      "abstract": "A review of the sleep of 31 patients 45 years old or older undergoing nocturnal penile tumescence studies showed that 19 had a previously undiagnosed sleep disorder. Of the patients 9 had periodic leg movements in sleep, 9 had sleep apnea and 1 had both disorders. In 10 of these patients the sleep disorders affected nocturnal penile tumescence by disrupting sleep and causing brief periods of detumescence, movement artifacts and delays in the tumescing phase of nocturnal penile tumescence. These disruptions resulted in an apparently abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence that appeared as if the patient had difficulty in achieving or maintaining an erection. The nocturnal penile tumescence disruptions may have reflected only a disruption of the necessary conditions for normal nocturnal penile tumescence to occur, namely adequate sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. The results strongly suggest that failure to measure concurrent sleep parameters and screen for occult sleep disorders could result in the incorrect diagnosis of abnormal nocturnal penile tumescence.",

      "title": "Insight in bipolar disorder",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Insight in bipolar disorder While the relationship between lack of insight in psychiatric disorders and anosognosia in neurological disorders has not been extensively studied, interest in examining psychiatric lack of insight has roots in advances in the understanding of the anosognosia. It is possible that both conditions share a common etiology in parietal and/or frontal lobe dysfunction, or they may represent two distinct entities with different etiologies, i.e., with predominance of brain dysfunction in anosognosia as opposed to the possible prominence of psychosocial factors in psychiatric lack of insight. While it has long been recognized that insight is impaired in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, the topic of insight in bipolar disorder has been relatively neglected. In mania, impairment of insight is about as severe as in schizophrenia and probably is associated with poor prognosis. The neuropsychological and/or psychosocial roots of lack of insight in mania remain unclear even if we recently reported that lack of insight might predict impaired decision-making in manic patients. In bipolar depression, impairment of insight is less severe than in mania; however, psychotic depression is associated with less insight than non-psychotic depression. There is some evidence that insight in depression may be less impaired when depressive symptoms are more severe, possibly supporting the depressive realism hypothesis. In remission, bipolar patients seem to recover insight. Thus, lack of insight in bipolar disorder appears to be a state-related phenomenon, unlike schizophrenia. Interest in studying clinical, neuropsychological and biological roots of insight in bipolar disorder, and their changes across different phases of illness, may improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying awareness of well-being in human.

      "title": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms in the dementias",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review Neuropsychiatric, or non-cognitive symptoms are increasingly recognized as manifestations of dementias. Recent findings In Alzheimer's disease, recent advances have included the identification of behavioral profiles, differentiation of apathy and depression, characterization of risk factors for psychosis and its links to agitation and aggression, and an analysis of depressive symptoms in the absence of major depression. Functional neuroimaging data mainly supported the role of the anterior cingulate in apathy. The orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate tangle burden were associated with agitation, and increased orbitofrontal and mid-temporal muscarinic M2 receptors with psychosis and hallucinations. Selected genetic polymorphisms of dopamine and serotonin receptors or transporters were linked with aggression, hallucinations or psychosis. When compared with other dementias, individuals with frontotemporal dementia disclosed, as expected, different behaviors and particularly aberrant social behavior. The frequency of delusions and visual hallucinations was increased in Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, suggesting common mechanisms such as Lewy body pathology and cholinergic deficiency. The latter was supported by an improvement of these symptoms by cholinesterase inhibitors. Summary Future research directions include both clinical and basic neuroscience investigations. The detection of early neuropsychiatric symptoms might be a marker for dementia, and the possible existence of a mild neuropsychiatric impairment syndrome should be explored. More longitudinal studies with pathological confirmation will facilitate correlations with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Functional neuroimaging and behavioral neurogenetics will permit in-vivo correlations and consequently help patient management and care.",

      "title": "Novel methods of symptom measurement in Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinsons Disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, gait impairment and rest tremor. Non-motor features including anosmia, Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric manifestations and cognitive changes are increasing recognized. The course of Parkinsons Disease is a progressive one and symptoms can fluctuate hour to hour. As such, symptom measurement plays a vital role by generating quantifiable targets to facilitate monitoring of disease progression and treatment response. In the absence of a reliable biomarker, symptom measurement is the cornerstone upon which diagnosis and clinical decisions are made and prognosis is gauged.\n\nConventional methods of subjective symptom reporting and validated objective clinical rating scales, to more contemporary approaches of technology-based quantitative measurement methods all have their unique strengths and shortcomings. While motor symptoms have more measurable physical properties, the best targets and the optimal method and platform to use remain unclear. Measurement of non-motor symptoms proves to be more challenging and remains a glaring gap in this field. A more measurable non-motor problem is cognitive impairment, which can be present even in the early stages of Parkinsons Disease. Cognitive assessment has both diagnostic and prognostic implications. However, it is uncertain which tests are most useful and more modern computerized approaches have not been extensively or rigorously studied. This compilation focuses on novel approaches and methods of measurement of motor and cognitive symptoms in Parkinsons Disease. Short and simple screening tests were developed. Specifically, motor symptoms were assessed and measured using smartphone technology and a self-reporting questionnaire. Following a critical statistical appraisal of the literature on cognitive assessment in parkinsonian disorders, a smartphone based cognitive test was developed to assess executive dysfunction.\n\nThe aims of this compilation are:\n\nTo establish the feasibility of using smartphone technology to measure motor deficits and cognition in patients with Parkinsons Disease by validation of a purpose built application;\n\nTo examine the pros and cons of objective motor assessment versus subjective symptom reporting by comparing the validated smartphone application and a self-reporting questionnaire using the clinical example of a motor phenomenon known as sleep benefit and\n\nTo interpret existing literature on the role of cognitive assessment in the diagnosis of Parkinsons Disease and other parkinsonian disorders using an innovative statistical approach.",

Neurological and cardiac symptoms may share underlying physiopathological mechanisms in diseases, such as Friedreich's ataxia and Wilson's disease, and in certain metabolic disorders, including Refsum disease, Gaucher disease, a congenital disorder of glycosylation, or cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. In certain conditions, such as Sydenham's chorea or dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome (ATX-DNAJC19), heart involvement can present early in the course of disease, whereas in others such as Friedreich's ataxia or Refsum disease, cardiac symptoms tend to present in later stages. In another 68 acquired or inherited conditions, cardiac involvement or movement disorders are seldom reported.As cardiac disease is part of the phenotypic spectrum of several movement disorders, heart involvement should be carefully investigated and increased awareness of this association encouraged as it may represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.",

Systematic studies of various phenomena demonstrating this delay have revealed that the perceptual latency decreases monotonically as the stimulus intensity increases. Because latencies measured by psychological methods and cortical evoked responses are very similar to electroretinogram latencies, it has become a common belief that there is little in the intensity-dependent latency function that cannot be explained by retinal processes. We report evidence that there is not one absolute visual delay common to the whole visual system, but that the delay varies considerably in different perceptual subsystems. The relative visual latency was found to be considerably shorter in a movement-discrimination task than in other perceptual tasks which presume visual awareness of the onset of visual events, or of their temporal order.",

In two of four brain areas examined, parietal and temporal cortex, choline acetyltransferase activities were significantly lower in patients with, compared to those without, hallucinations (20% and 50% of the normal, respectively).

      "abstract": "Abnormalities in attention have long been viewed as one of the fundamental underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, likely contributing both to formation of some types of symptoms and particularly to the substantial work and social impairments that often accompany schizophrenia. Yet, the precise nature of the attentional deficits in schizophrenia remains poorly understood. Translating advances in cognitive psychology to clinical research brings paradigms with greater analytic power to the study of attention in schizophrenia. In particular, these paradigms should shed light on whether the attentional dysfunction in schizophrenia is best conceptualized as arising from limitations in amount or allocation of processing capacity or from more specific structural bottlenecks that do not allow certain processes to be carried out in two tasks simultaneously. Certain types of dual-task paradigms are particularly well suited to make distinctive predictions, particularly those involving a psychological refractory period paradigm. The background and design of a series of ongoing studies of prodromal, first-episode, and chronic schizophrenia patients are described that are addressing the developmental course of attentional dysfunction in this disorder. These refined paradigms should substantially increase our understanding of the specific forms of attentional impairment characterizing schizophrenia and their connections to symptom development and functional outcome.",

      "abstract": "Sleepis one of the best-documented factors influencing the expression of seizuresand interictal discharges. Janz studied the relation between seizures and thesleep/wake cycle and divided the epilepsies into three categories: nocturnal,awakening, and diffuse. Since then, the effect of sleep on the ictal andinterictal manifestations of epilepsy has been studied extensively. Manyseizures are activated by sleep or arousal from sleep. Interictal dischargesare also seen more commonly during sleep, with the greatest activation seenduring nonrapid eye movement sleep. Sleep not only increases the frequency ofepileptiform abnormalities, but also may alter their morphology anddistribution. Sleep deprivation also facilitates both epileptiformabnormalities and seizures. Seizures, on the other hand, also impact sleep.Epileptic patients demonstrate multiple sleep abnormalities, including anincreased sleep latency, fragmented sleep, increased awakenings and stageshifts, and an increase in stages 1 and 2 of nonrapid eye movement sleep.These disturbances may in turn be modulated by antiepileptic treatment. Thisreview summarizes the interactions between sleep and epilepsy, including thetiming of seizures during the sleep/wake cycle, the influence of sleep onvarious seizure disorders, the effects of sleep deprivation, and the changesin sleep patterns caused by seizures and theirtreatment.",

This article is written to advance the recognition and diagnosis of NCSE. Case presentation Four cases of NCSE were reported and their semiology, electroencephalogram (EEG) features, etiology, treatment and prognosis were retrospectively analyzed. Most of the 4 cases presented with impaired consciousness (confused, slow reaction and lags in response) and some strange behaviors (being upset and restless or washing hands repeatedly). None of them had any obvious motor symptoms like tonic or clonic movements. EEG of the 4 cases initially manifested with either a focal or a generalized onset, then evolved into spike-and-wave pattern gradually. With a favorable response to antiepileptic drugs, they all had a good outcome without any sequela. Conclusions NCSE is much more common than was considered in the past, which is featured by little or no evidence of movement or other symptoms. NCSE can lead to a favorable outcome in most patients.",

In these cases, the initial symptoms became manifest either during or immediately subsequent to some severe emotional disturbance or psychic trauma and the objective neurologic signs were at first minimal. As a result, the symptoms were attributed to emotional causes and only later after the objective neurologic signs had progressed was the correct diagnosis established. The possible role of the emotional disturbances as an etiological factor in the production of the structural changes is discussed. It is suggested that the emotional trauma precipitates both physiologic and psychologic alterations which lead to the appearance of objective neurologic signs.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is characterized by chronic subjective dizziness, phobic postural vertigo, and related disorders. For at least 3 months, it exhibits varying symptoms of vertigo, unsteadiness, or dizziness. Methods: Research articles regarding PPPD were searched by viewing the Scopus, PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases online. A search strategy using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis was used. Results: It presents a typical chronic vestibular system and brain malfunction that result in persistent dizziness, nonspinning vertigo, and/or unsteadiness. Persistent nonvertiginous dizziness and hypersensitivity to motion and visual stimuli are the main signs and symptoms of PPPD. These symptoms appeared either when there were no active neuro-otologic illnesses or when an episodic vestibular condition was present but could not completely account for the symptoms. Psychological mechanisms that resemble cognitive models of health anxiety and panic disorder are involved in the PPPDs development and maintenance. Conclusion: Since PPPDs diagnostic criteria only involve symptoms, the patient's clinical history is crucial in making the diagnosis. Once diagnosed, effective communication and personalized treatment plans, such as serotonergic medicines, cognitive behavioral therapy, and specialized physical therapy (vestibular rehabilitation), help manage PPPD. Since PPPD is a relatively recent clinical diagnosis, many medical practitioners who treat patients who feel dizzy are unfamiliar with it.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics WDR26-related intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by developmental delay / intellectual disability, characteristic facial features, hypotonia, epilepsy, and infant feeding difficulties. To date 15 individuals, ages 24 months to 34 years, have been reported. Developmental delay is present in all individuals and ranges from mild to severe. All individuals have delayed speech. Although some begin to develop speech in the second year, others have remained nonverbal. Seizures, present in all affected individuals reported to date, can be febrile or non-febrile (tonic-clonic, absence, rolandic seizures); most seizures are self limited or respond well to standard treatment. Affected individuals are generally described as happy and socially engaging; several have stereotypies / autistic features (repetitive or rocking behavior, abnormal hand movements or posturing, and at times self-stimulation). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of WDR26-related ID is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in WDR26 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of developmental delay / intellectual disability, seizures, infant feeding problems, and behavioral issues. Surveillance: In infancy: regular assessment of swallowing, feeding, and nutritional status to determine safety of oral vs gastrostomy feeding. For all age groups: routine monitoring of developmental progress, educational needs, and behavioral issues. Genetic counseling WDR26-related ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. All individuals reported to date have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If the WDR26 pathogenic variant found in the proband cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the recurrence risk to sibs is estimated to be 1% because of the theoretic possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

These cases are rare, often unilateral, and because of the usually transitory duration of symptoms, often under-recognized. When a treatment is required, it can be tricky and the drug choice not foregone. We report 2 patients with unilateral poststroke PLM with similar clinical pictures but different symptoms, therapy, and outcome. The first is a long-lasting unilateral PLM video case with chronic vascular lesions leading to insomnia even if with no urgence or any subjective symptoms as in RLS but well responding only to a definite RLS treatment. The second case is an acute, short-duration self-limiting PLM with positive brain MRI lesion imaging. Our cases suggest that unilateral poststroke PLM even if distinct in subjective and radiological features from secondary RLS can sometimes have a definite and effective dopaminergic treatment if long-lasting. Putative mechanism of chronic case 1 PLM could be due to a further stroke sparing sensory pathways and making the patient unaware of subjective RLS-like symptoms.",

This illness is commonly associated with a number of cognitive and affective deficits as well as with some more specific sleep abnormalities. It has been previously proposed that psychosis and positive symptoms in schizophrenia could be understood as disorders of internal brain dynamics. This proposed disordered network interplay might be particularly displayed during sleep when modulation by the senses is at the minimum. It is argued here that sleep abnormalities in schizophrenia inform our understanding of the pathomechanisms involved in psychosis. More specifically, sleep spindle initiation in NREM sleep and the preparation of sensory pathways for upcoming motor actions during wakefulness may share a common mechanism, and this shared mechanism is suggested to be impaired in schizophrenia.",

Patients suffering from chronic pain of neuropathic origin experience worsened health and greater disability than those not suffering from this type of pain. Disorders of the peripheral nervous system, including sensory disturbance, are commonly seen in adults. Peripheral neuropathy has a prevalence of 2.4% in the general population and increases with age to an estimated 8% in those over 55 years of age. Nerve fibers affected by peripheral neuropathy may serve motor, sensory, or autonomic functions; the fibers may be large or small; the distribution of neuropathic involvement may be proximal, distal, or multifocal; and the onset of symptoms may be acute (less than 3 weeks), subacute (3 weeks to 3 months), or chronic (over 3 months). Peripheral neuropathy may occur as a result of several common and many rare diseases, but the most common cause is diabetes. Diseases of the peripheral nervous system may involve muscles (myopathies), nerves (neuropathies, with axons and myelin being affected), and neuromuscular junctions.

Depression, confusion, and thought disorders are frequently associated with the critical symptomatology, and they may suggest other psychiatric diagnoses (schizophrenia, mood disorder, conversion disorder) or a substance abuse. A diencephalic-hypothalamic dysfunction is suspected, even if this composite symptomatology cannot easily be linked to a simple mechanism. The aim of this article is to illustrate problems in differential diagnosis, using a case approach. History, course, and therapeutic intervention in a 21-year-old patient with KLS, associated with a clear psychiatric symptomatology and a critical affective pattern, is reported. Psychiatric correlates of KLS are discussed, including the relationship with affective disorders and the possible emotional impact of the attacks. Implications regarding a combined psychological and pharmacological treatment are also discussed.",

      "title": "[Neuropsychological disorders in minor hemisphere damage].",
      "abstract": "Damage to the minor hemisphere or the right hemisphere of most right-handed subjects produces various neuropsychological disorders. Unilateral spatial neglect is the deficit to respond or orient to stimuli on the left side. The inferior parietal lobule is most frequently involved in the lesions of neglect patients, but lesions confined to the lobule may not cause chronic neglect. Severe and lasting neglect is frequently found in patients with an infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery or the anterior choroidal artery. Neglect is usually mild or moderate after frontal lesions. The most important mechanism of neglect seems to be disorders in spatial attention: rightward attentional bias, and impairment in disengagement and shift of attention from the right side. Directional hypokinesia is rarely observed in the chronic stage. Non-spatial factors, such as motivational deficit, insufficient compensation with verbal intelligence, or disuse of an appropriate spatial strategy may also contribute to the appearance of neglect. Anosognosia for hemiplegia is found in about half of patients with acute cerebrovascular accidents in the right hemisphere. Generalized attentional and intellectual deficits, diffuse brain atrophy or hypometabolism, and presence of multiple infarction may result in chronic anosognosia. Constructional disability is observed in about 30% patients with either hemisphere damage. Dressing apraxia is more frequent in right hemisphere damage. These two disorders, however, rarely appear as isolated neuropsychological deficits. Most patients show some of the accompanying disorders, such as unilateral spatial neglect, anosognosia, anosodiaphoria, and generalized attentional and intellectual impairment. By contrast, motor neglect may occur independently of the other disorders. Motor neglect follows damage to either hemisphere, although it occurs more frequently after right hemisphere damage. Neuropsychological deficits characteristic of right hemisphere damage may be unilateral spatial neglect in the acute and chronic stages and anosognosia for hemiplegia in the acute stage.",

Here we suggest the hypothesis that cognitive reserve is also important in neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression.We review the history of passive and active models of reserve, and apply the concept to neuropsychiatric disorders. Schizophrenia is used as an exemplar because the effects of premorbid IQ and cognitive function in this disorder have been extensively studied.Cognitive reserve may impact on neuropsychiatric disorders in three ways: by affecting the risk for developing the disorder, in the expression of symptoms within disorders, and in patients' functional outcome. Cognitive failure below a certain threshold may alone, or in combination with common psychiatric symptoms, produce neuropsychiatric syndromes.Consideration of cognitive reserve may considerably improve our understanding of individual differences in the causes and consequences of neuropsychiatric disorders. For these reasons, the concept of cognitive reserve should be incorporated in future studies of neuropsychiatric disorder. It may be possible to enhance cognitive reserve through pharmacological or non-pharmacological means, such as education, neurocognitive activation or other treatment programmes.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, and eventual deterioration of bulbar functions. Early in the disease, affected individuals may have gait disturbance, slurred speech, difficulty with balance, brisk deep tendon reflexes, hypermetric saccades, nystagmus, and mild dysphagia. Later signs include slowing of saccadic velocity, development of up-gaze palsy, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia, and hypotonia. In advanced stages, muscle atrophy, decreased deep tendon reflexes, loss of proprioception, cognitive impairment (e.g., frontal executive dysfunction, impaired verbal memory), chorea, dystonia, and bulbar dysfunction are seen. Onset is typically in the third or fourth decade, although childhood onset and late-adult onset have been reported. Those with onset after age 60 years may manifest a pure cerebellar phenotype. Interval from onset to death varies from ten to 30 years; individuals with juvenile onset show more rapid progression and more severe disease. Anticipation is observed. An axonal sensory neuropathy detected by electrophysiologic testing is common; brain imaging typically shows cerebellar and brain stem atrophy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCA1 rests on the result of molecular genetic testing to detect an abnormal CAG trinucleotide expansion in ATXN1. Affected individuals have alleles with 39 or more CAG trinucleotide repeats. Such testing detects 100% of cases. Management Treatment of manifestations: Canes and walkers to help prevent falls; modification of the home with grab bars, raised toilet seats, and ramps for motorized chairs; speech therapy and communication devices for dysarthria; weighted eating utensils and dressing hooks to help maintain independence. Intensive rehabilitation (coordinative physiotherapy) may be beneficial. Weight control is important because obesity can exacerbate difficulties with ambulation and mobility. Video esophagram can help to identify the consistency of food least likely to trigger aspiration and feeding devices may be indicated when dysphagia becomes troublesome. Prevention of secondary complications: Medications may help symptomatic secondary problems such as spasticity, bladder urgency, depression, and pain; vitamin supplements are recommended if caloric intake is reduced. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation every three to six months. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Alcohol, medications known to cause nerve damage (e.g., isoniazid). Circumstances that could lead to physical harm, such as operating machinery or climbing to great heights, should be avoided. Genetic counseling SCA1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the expanded allele. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies is possible if the diagnosis has been confirmed by molecular genetic testing in an affected relative; however, requests for prenatal testing of typically adult-onset diseases are not common.",

      "abstract": "A consultation on the neuropsychiatric aspects of HIV-1 infection was held at the World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters January 11-13, 1990. Of topics discussed, participants concluded that a group of conditions characterized by cognitive and motor impairment can be described. New terminology was suggested accordingly. Participants found that otherwise health HIV-1 seropositive patients were no more likely than HIV-1 seronegative patients to manifest clinically significant cognitive impairment. The serological screening of asymptomatic patients for HIV-1 in attempts to protect public safety was therefore deemed unnecessary. Hallucinations and delusions being not infrequent in AIDS and ARC patients, they may be indicative of cognitive impairment or later accompanied by symptoms pointing to diagnosis of delirium or dementia. Acute psychotic disorders outside of evidence of cognitive impairment may result as anomalies described within the text. Depressive syndrome may result outside of severe depressive episode or major depression due to recent diagnosis as HIV-1 positive and/or as the first stage of HIV-1 dementia. DIstinguishing between ARC and the above-mentioned states as the cause of this syndrome may be difficult. Consultation participants cited stress associated with HIV-1 infection or disease to be conditioned by several factors. Finally, neuropsychiatric disorders due to HIV-1 opportunistic processes were discussed. Country-level recommendations included preparing health workers for a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions in the HIV-1 positive patient, and notifying then that otherwise healthy HIV-1 positive patients may not show clinically significant signs of cognitive impairment. Recommendations followed in urging health services to prepare for a large burden of neuropsychiatric illness in AIDS and ARC patients; governments should support services and train health workers accordingly. Pre- and post-serological testing counseling was stressed, with facility for and understanding of the special needs of HIV-1 positive patients' families and involved health staff. Research on the neurological and mental health needs of patients should be given high priority with attention given to the immediate policy and care implications. Final qualification of the difficulty involved in generalizing research findings to apply across sociocultural and geographical contexts was provided with mention in the text of a WHO multicenter study addressing this concern in its pilot phase at the time of publication. Neurological tests were designed for use in this study to be culturally nonspecific.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

      "title": "Interface between tauopathies and synucleinopathies: A tale of two proteins",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neurodegenerative diseases are often classified based on the abnormal accumulation of synuclein or tau. Traditionally, these disorders have been viewed as distinct clinical and pathological entities. However, advances in molecular genetics and protein biochemistry have shown intriguing overlaps. The most common synucleinopathy, Parkinson's disease, is characterized by extrapyramidal motor dysfunction, whereas the most common tauopathy, Alzheimer's disease, is defined by dementia. Yet there is overlap of clinical features; Parkinson's disease patients frequently have dementia, and Alzheimer's disease patients often manifest parkinsonism. Dementia with Lewy bodies exemplifies the existence of a continuum among these diseases. This overlap extends to the neuropathological findings; the pathognomonic hallmark for one set of disorders, Lewy bodies or neurofibrillary tangles, is present more often than expected in the other set. Moreover, mutations in LRRK2 known to cause parkinsonism are associated not only with dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, but also with the accumulation of synuclein, tau, neither, or both proteins. Other shared genetic features between tauopathies and synucleinopathies also exist. Finally, the known protein interactions between tau and synuclein further highlight the interface. Evidence for the intersection of tauopathies and synucleinopathies indicates the need for an updated disease classification scheme and may have important implications for therapeutic development.

      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es una enfermedad con sustrato cerebral organico que presenta no solo sintomas como delirios y alucinaciones, sino que supone tambien, de forma consistente, un deterioro en el funcionamiento cognitivo, afectivo, relacional y laboral. Si bien sabemos que la causa de la enfermedad es una afectacion cerebral, se desconoce, no solo la etiologia de dicha afectacion, sino el momento en que esta sucede, su posterior evolucion y los factores pronosticos. Una de las manifestaciones de esta afectacion cerebral, es el deterioro cognitivo. El deterioro cognitivo propio de la esquizofrenia se ha demostrado que no es difuso o generalizado, sino que afecta de forma diferencial y especifica a la atencion, memoria de trabajo, memoria y funciones ejecutivas, si bien es cierto que otras funciones que dependen del optimo funcionamiento de estas, van a verse secundariamente afectadas. Asi mismo, la literatura avala la asociacion de la gravedad de la afectacion cognitiva a la mayor presencia de sintomas negativos y a un peor desempeno social y laboral. El deficit cognitivo inherente a la enfermedad se ha podido observar tambien en familiares sanos de personas con esquizofrenia y en poblaciones de riesgo para desarrollar psicosis, por lo que determinados deficits cognitivos han sido conceptualizados como marcadores endofenotipicos de vulnerabilidad a la esquizofrenia. Una de las cuestiones aun sin resolver en relacion con el deterioro cognitivo en la esquizofrenia, es su evolucion a lo largo del desarrollo de la enfermedad, habiendose planteado como hipotesis alternativas, que su evolucion es estatica, o que sigue un curso de deterioro, lento, pero progresivo. Para tratar de responder a esta cuestion, se ha realizado un estudio de diseno transversal, con una muestra de 22 pacientes con una evolucion de la enfermedad entre uno y cinco anos, y 21 pacientes con diez o mas anos de evolucion de la enfermedad.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, that typically manifests in adulthood, clinically characterized by progressive motor, cognitive and psychiatric/behavioural symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms are common in HD. The presentation of these symptoms is highly variable, and their course does not correlate with motor or cognitive disease progression. Psychiatric symptoms often precede motor onset by many years. Objectives The authors intend to review the literature the most frequent psychiatric disorders in patients with HD. Methods Non-systematic review of the literature. Results Psychiatric symptoms have been a core feature of HD. Pre-symptomatic HD patients exhibit a greater prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, particularly affective disorders. This symptoms are presenting symptoms of HD in up to half of all people. In symptomatic HD patients, it is estimated that up to 73–98% of patients will have a major psychiatric disorder or psychiatric symptoms. Psychiatric manifestations in HD include depression, irritability, apathy, anxiety, mania, perseverations, obsessions and psychosis. Cognitive changes include progressive deficits in attention, learning, executive and sensory functions, resulting in dementia. Depression, diagnosed in half of patients with HD, is the most common and earliest symptoms prior to the motor onset. There are likely multiple causes of the psychiatric symptoms, with underlying factors including a combination of neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, social and environmental factors. Conclusions Patients with HD have high psychiatric comorbidity, that causes significant functional impairment and affect quality of life. Thus, they require a multidisciplinary approach in the recognition and treatment of psychiatric symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Neurotoxicity is a term that refers to the condition in which the nervous system is exposed to dangerous substances (neurotoxicants) either naturally occurring or created, impairing the nervous system’s normal function. Few of these neurotoxins act directly on neural cells, whereas others impair metabolic processes heavily reliant on the neurological system. Neurotoxicity can occur as a side effect of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, drug therapies, organ transplantation, and vulnerability to heavy metals such as mercury and lead, certain foods, pesticides, industrial products, and solvents used in cleaning cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products. Additionally, there are a few naturally occurring compounds. Symptoms of intoxication may begin to develop immediately upon exposure or may take time to manifest. These symptoms may include encephalopathy, limb weakness or numbness, cognitive and behavioral impairments. Following the elimination or decrease of exposure to hazardous chemicals, symptomatic and supportive therapy is provided. The prognosis is highly variable and depends on the duration and depth of vulnerability and the degree of the neurological impairment. Neurotoxicant vulnerability can be lethal in rare instances. Patients may survive in some cases despite their failure to heal completely. In other cases, many individuals recover completely following treatment.",

Types of nystagmoid eye movements include saccadic intrusions, such as square wave jerks and ocular flutter/opsoclonus, voluntary nystagmus, superior oblique myokymia, as well as the Heimann-Bielschowsky phenomenon. In addition, sensory intermittent exotropia is a clinical entity that should be on the differential when considering patients with involuntary eye movements, many of whom will also have a history of decreased visual acuity.

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

      "abstract": "Ataxia refers to instability of posture or lack of coordination of movement occurring independently of motor weakness. Characteristic manifestations of ataxia include postural and gait abnormalities, incoordination of limb movements, dysarthria and oculomotor disturbances. Postural changes are typified by swaying instability of the trunk while standing or even sitting. A wide-based stance is assumed, but patients may still have difficulty maintaining balance. Gait is irregular, wide-based and staggering, with loss of the ability to tandem walk. Limb abnormalities include dysmetria, an inability to perform movements with proper timing and trajectory. Intention tremor, loss of fluidity of movement, inability to control force of movement and a reduced ability to perform rapid alternating movements, dysdiadochokinesia, are features of dysmetria. Dysarthria is defined by abnormalities of rhythm, fluency and clarity of speech. Oculomotor changes may consist of disorders of ocular fixation, ocular alignment, visual pursuit, saccadic movements, and nystagmus. Several clinical assessment scales have been developed, the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS)107,111 and the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA),94 to evaluate the degree of clinical involvement in ataxic patients. A guideline for the use of these scales in the management of ataxias has been published by the Movement Disorders Society.82 Although ataxic conditions can be separated into two groups, primary and secondary (Table 22.1), the primary group is the focus of this chapter, with particular emphasis on inherited forms (Table 22.2). The secondary ataxias and congenital ataxias are summarised in Box 22.1.",

CVI is a term that encompasses visual impairment caused by brain damage and is considered a neurological visual impairment. Because this condition is still not sufficiently explored, experts often equate this condition with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during the diagnostic procedure. ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition defined by difficulties in social communication and interaction and limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.\r\n Some children with CVI show difficulties in social integration, as well as difficulties in recognizing emotions and a limited ability to separate important signs from the face. Therefore, it is not surprising that one of these two conditions remains unrecognized during diagnosis.\r\n CVI can lead to impaired cognitive, motor, and social development, putting children at risk of developing behavioral traits resembling autism spectrum disorder. Similarly, children who develop cognitive and social developmental disorders may manifest a range of visual and perceptual deficits.\r\n Such a dual perspective emphasizes the great need to establish a link between visual impairment and neurodevelopmental disorders, for which it is important to recognize and act as early as possible by applying appropriate social and educational strategies. Today, more and more experts emphasize and point out that targeted and systematic testing for visual and perceptual impairments as well as the application of long-term and quality methods of work is becoming imperative for all children at risk.\r\n This paper provides an overview of the conditions of CVI and ASD, their diagnostic criteria and questionnaires, and certain work methods. It also shows the main similarities and differences between the conditions and emphasizes the need for additional engagement of experts in the diagnostic process as well as in direct work.",

      "title": "Dysautonomias: Clinical Disorders of the Autonomic Nervous System",
      "abstract": "The term dysautonomia refers to a change in autonomic nervous system function that adversely affects health. The changes range from transient, occasional episodes of neurally mediated hypotension to progressive neurodegenerative diseases; from disorders in which altered autonomic function plays a primary pathophysiologic role to disorders in which it worsens an independent pathologic state; and from mechanistically straightforward to mysterious and controversial entities. In chronic autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson disease), orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure from sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after “patchy” autonomic impairment or blood volume depletion or, as highlighted in this discussion, from a primary abnormality that augments delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart. Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys seems to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm that is associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, which rationalizes treatment with β-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between the chronic fatigue syndrome and orthostatic intolerance; however, treatment with the salt-retaining steroid fludrocortisone, which is usually beneficial in primary chronic autonomic failure, does not seem to be beneficial in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Dysautonomias are an important subject in clinical neurocardiology.",

      "title": "Commentary: A Quest for a Novel Peripheral Biomarker for Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a disabling disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep manifestations including cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions), sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep-onset REM (SOREM) periods 1. It is generally admitted that narcolepsy with cataplexy is caused by the loss of hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin neurons 2. Patients with narcolepsy–cataplexy have been shown to lack hypocretin-1 in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This allows distinguishing narcolepsy with cataplexy from other forms of central hypersomnia, that is, narcolepsy without cataplexy and idiopathic hypersomnia, which show normal CSF hypocretin-1 level 3 and is sufficient to define narcolepsy type 1 based on the last classification (ICSD-3). However, because of a possible continuum in terms of clinical manifestations and physiopathological mechanisms between these sleep disorders 4, 5, differential diagnosis remains often tricky and difficult. Developing an easy, reliable, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tool has always been a major requirement in sleep medicine. Since the nineties, genotyping for HLA DR2 is extensively used as an index to confirm diagnosis because 85–95% of patients with narcolepsy–cataplexy carry the DQB1*0602 haplotype. However, it is unspecific to narcolepsy with cataplexy because it is also found in 20% of the general population. A striking decrease in CSF hypocretin-1 has been noted in patients with narcolepsy–cataplexy with a high (94%) positive predictive value for the diagnosis 3. Unfortunately, such measurements require invasive lumbar puncture and it is of no use for differentiating narcolepsy without cataplexy from idiopathic or other hypersomnia. A few studies measured plasmatic hypocretin-1 levels, but the reliability of this approach remains a matter of debate. Finally, other tryouts have also been attempted without clear success 6, 7. In a recent letter to the editor of CNS Neurosci Therap., Chen and colleagues 8 using HPLC and mass spectrometry have analyzed serum proteins in 35 patients with narcolepsy (25 with cataplexy), compared with 49 patients with other sleep disorders and 35 healthy controls. They found a protein fragment peak in 65.7% of patients with narcolepsy, 72% when considering patients with cataplexy only. The authors further sequenced the extracted protein fragment and identified it as RBM4/Lark protein 8. This is clearly an interesting attempt and original observation, worth to be pursued in further investigations in order to assess whether such RBM4/Lark protein may constitute a specific marker of narcolepsy and therefore a useful diagnostic tool. On the one hand, the protein fragment peak was also seen in 15% of other patients with sleep disorder and 16% of healthy controls 8. Quantitative analysis on patients with narcolepsy and the two control groups is therefore necessary to determine to which extent the RBM4/Lark protein could be specific to narcolepsy. On the other hand, only three patients with idiopathic hypersomnia and 10 with narcolepsy without cataplexy were included in this study 8. A much larger group size of patients in a matched case–control study is required to confirm whether or not the RBM4/Lark protein could serve as marker to differentiate narcolepsy from other forms of hypersomnia. In addition, the authors also report that the protein peak was not correlated with excessive daytime sleepiness assessed using Epworth scale, but was correlated positively with cataplexy and negatively with sleep latency and the number of SOREM during the multiple sleep latency tests 8. If one considers short sleep latency as an index of sleepiness, and SOREM and cataplexy as signs of REM sleep dysregulation, the significance of these correlations with narcoleptic phenotypes is of interest although it remains to be determined. Finally, detection, quantification, and other further studies of the RBM4/Lark protein in currently available narcoleptic animal models, such as those in murine, will certainly promote its characterization as marker of narcolepsy. Another major question raised from this study is the biological significance of the presence of such a Lark protein in the serum of patients with narcolepsy. Is it a consequence of the pathology in the CNS or periphery or is it a reflection of adaptive mechanisms? Unfortunately, the functional links between sleep and Lark protein are currently poorly understood. RBM4/Lark is an evolutionary conserved RNA-binding protein involved in pleiotropic functions such as stress, immune responses, and development 9. It controls the expression of a large number of genes, including those involved in the circadian clock 10. Increased expression of RBM4/Lark lengthens the circadian period in fly and mammalian cells 10, 11. The RBM4/Lark protein expression varies according to the molecular clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus 10, the CNS master clock modulated by hypocretinergic inputs. RBM4/Lark transcripts are listed among the genes that are regulated in a circadian manner 12. While circadian distribution of REM sleep is impaired in narcoleptic mice 13, few studies in patients with narcolepsy have focused on their circadian rhythms. In view of their excessive daytime sleepiness, decreased physical activity, and nocturnal sleep fragmentation, it is not to be excluded that their day/night balance is somehow affected. Investigations on the circadian rhythms and their links with the RBM4/Lark protein in patients with narcolepsy are needed to examine such a hypothesis. The RBM4/Lark protein therefore not only appears to be a molecule of interest with ubiquitous expression and broad array of functions, but also clearly associated with narcolepsy and circadian rhythms. Whether or not it constitutes a biomarker of narcolepsy requires further investigation, but the study of Chen et al. 8 in consistence with quite many recent studies shows that easily accessible body fluids such as blood, saliva, and urine are likely to provide interesting avenues for identification of biomarkers of sleep disorders, given the major impact of sleep disruption on the constituents of these fluids (e.g., 14, 15). This is critical to fulfill the need for new diagnostic tools in sleep medicine.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The concept of “subcortical dementia” is controversial, lacking clinical validation and having only a questionable pathological basis. Over 100 patients with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Huntington's disease, subdivided into three functional disability stages, were given a brief quantitative neuropsychological assessment. Patients with Huntington's or Parkinson's disease were less intellectually impaired than those with Alzheimer's disease at each functional stage. Criteria for dementia were present in all of the Alzheimer's patients but in only half of the Huntington's and Parkinson's disease groups. Patients with similar overall intellectual function scores had no distinct pattern of neuropsychological test performance. Depression, absent in patients with Alzheimer's disease, was present in half the patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's disease and was correlated with intellectual decline. The concept of subcortical dementia is misleading. The pattern of neuropsychological impairment is not distinct, and the neuropathological basis of dementia in these diseases may result from a combination of cortical and subcortical degeneration.",

In the second case of a 37 years old female patient, herpes simplex encephalitis was suspected due to sudden onset of speech arrest and to brain MRI and CSF findings. Her symptoms improved during antiviral treatment but later progressive dementia developed. CSF serological tests proved the presence of neurolues-dementia paralytica. The third patient was a 38-years-old female. Neurological examination was performed because of progressive memory loss, changed behaviour and impaired attention. Neuropsychological test showed severe dementia. Metachromatic leukodystrophy was proven by decreased arylsulfatase activity.It is not easy to recognize the early symptoms of dementia. In these cases, besides detailed history, neurological examination and neuropsychological tests, brain MRI and cerebral spinal fluid serological tests were indispensable for a correct diagnosis, especially in the young patients.",

      "title": "ALS Mimics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Most patients die within 2–5 years of symptom onset due to the lack of effective therapy options. A diagnostic delay is encountered quite often, since disease progression as well as site and speed of onset may vary significantly. Some diseases can mimic features of ALS, especially in early stages. It is very important to differentiate those mimics from ALS as potentially treatable conditions might be missed otherwise. ALS typically affects the upper as well as the lower motor neuron, which implies that diseases sharing at least one of these clinical features have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. The following conditions should be taken into account as a differential diagnosis for ALS with predominant affection of the lower motor neuron: Immune mediated neuropathies such as multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with pronounced distal paresis without striking atrophy signs and conduction blocks in electroneurography, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) with common signs of sensibility disturbances, areflexia and cytoalbuminologic dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) with typical biopsy findings and clinically predominant affection of the finger flexors. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), in which androgen receptor (AR-)gene testing and clinical signs of androgen insensitivity will help to differentiate the disease from ALS. Hirayama disease shows cold paresis; a cervical MRI scan and a normal neurography will help to confirm the diagnosis. In benign fasciculation syndrome, there is no muscle paresis or atrophy, and acute denervation cannot be detected in the EMG. In spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), testing for the SMN gene will help to differentiate the condition from ALS; furthermore, SMA is a very rare disease in adults. As a differential diagnosis for ALS with both clinical affection of the upper and lower motor neuron e. g. metabolic diseases such as adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy and Tay-Sachs disease should be taken into account. Here, laboratory tests are the most important steps for a correct diagnosis. Cervical myelopathy is also capable of affecting the upper and lower motor neuron, but can easily be differentiated by a cervical MRI scan. As a differential diagnosis of ALS with predominant affection of the upper motor neuron, we discuss hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) which presents with a symmetric spasticity of the legs. The MRI often shows atrophy of the spinal cord, and SPG gene testing is done to differentiate HSP from ALS.",

This review indicates that future studies should distinguish among (1) apparent obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) that occur only in the context of psychosis and that may overlap with psychotic phenomenology, representing a forme fruste of psychosis; (2) OCS occurring only in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia; (3) neuroleptic-induced OCS or OCD; and (4) OCS or frank OCD occurring concurrently with schizophrenia.

Overall, there was a modest but significant deterioration in cognitive function over the decade, particularly among older men. Longitudinally, patients with persistent tardive (orofacial) dyskinesia continued to show poorer cognitive function than those consistently without such movement disorder, though within neither group did cognitive function change over the decade. Those patients demonstrating prospectively the emergence of orofacial dyskinesia showed a marked deterioration in their cognitive function over the same time-frame within which their movement disorder emerged, but this decline did not progress further thereafter. There appears to exist some modes, progressive deterioration in cognitive function even late in the chronic phase of severe schizophrenic illness which appears to derive primarily from patients showing de novo emergence of tardive orofacial dyskinesia.",

The latter have the advantage of enticing the practitioner to systematically evaluate specific sleep disorders. Such classifications include neurodegenerative disorders, neuromuscular disorders, movement disorders, autoimmune disorders, cerebrovascular diseases, seizures, and headaches. The manifestations in terms of their impact on sleep often depend, of course, on the location of the lesion. Some neurologic diseases involve the sleep-wake system. For example, dementing disorders may affect diffuse neural pathways that impact the strength of the circadian rhythm, but also instability of sleep and sleep states. In contrast, other disorders secondarily impact sleep and its quality. As an example, neuromuscular disorders can impact control of swallowing and the airway, which can increase susceptibility to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).",

The prevalence of delirium in elderly patients admitting to hospital is 5-55% [1]. Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome that may occur in several different settings and one of them is vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes many cerebral cortex abnormalities such as confusion, mood and memory changes, delirium with or without hallucinations, depression and acute psychotic states [2,3]. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) describes the spectrum of potentially reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities seen in patients with liver dysfunction after exclusion of unrelated neurologic and/or metabolic abnormalities. The clinical manifestations of HE is characterized by cognitive and motor deficits of varying severity without specific lesions in the central nervous system. The symptoms range from minimal changes in personality to coma, including delirium [4]. Usually, in the elderly patients with cirrhosis, it is hard to differentiate two clinical situations. Here we report a case of an elderly patient with cirrhosis who experienced delirium due to vitamin B12 deficiency, but was treated as HE before.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a disorder, or a class of disorders, of cognition. Defining features include a loss of coordination in core perception, attention, memory, and executive functions together with the dysregulation of emotion. These features are the strongest contributors to burden of illness. Diagnostic criteria, clinical trials, and popular conceptions typically focus, however, on the more florid positive symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations. As a result, impairments in cognitive–emotional function remain largely undiagnosed and untreated, with no current treatments in routine use that target these impairments. The evidence base for developing new treatments requires cognitive–emotional measures that link to functional capacity as well as to brain changes involved in schizophrenia pathophysiology. This chapter looks at five aspects of cognitive–emotional function in schizophrenia: Which cognitive–emotional impairments characterize schizophrenia patients at first onset? Are functional capacities predicted by these impairments at first onset? What brain systems are involved? How do cognitive–emotional impairments, and their relationships with functional capacity and brain function, progress over time? What are the implications for treatment outcomes? Focus is on the first episode of schizophrenia, since early intervention is likely to have the best impact for improving outcomes. Published in the Strungmann Forum Reports Series.",

By way of onset, seizures can be classified as focal, generalized, unknown, or unclassifiable. An underlying structural abnormality can cause focal seizures in the brain. Among these, the temporal lobe is the most prevalent, but there may be alterations in the frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes. The objective of this case report is to contribute to the knowledge of the multiple symptoms of patients with parietal lobe seizures. Case Report: The report is about parietal aura, diagnosed in the patient J.F.R., a 45-year-old male, and reported his first seizure in 2017. The patient said the increasing onset of the condition leads to significant body image disorders (the representation of the child during eye contact is similar to that of a monster). A limb or a body side may also appear heavier, more significant, absent, or separate from the rest of the body. The postictal period was slow, and full consciousness and correct body image emerged insidiously. Conclusion: In the evaluation, it is essential to value not only the main complaint but also the entire psychic context, cognitive function, and interpersonal and social relationships since these aspects can affect the quality of life of these patients and their integration into the social environment.",

The specific stimulus can be a variety of heterogenous intrinsic or extrinsic factors, ranging from the simple to the complex, such as flashing lights or reading a book. These seizures can take a variety of forms, comprising either general or focal onset, with or without secondary generalization. Reflex epilepsies (RE) are classified as a specific syndrome in which all epileptic seizures are precipitated by sensory stimuli. The few designated RE include idiopathic photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy, other visual sensitive epilepsies, primary reading epilepsy, and startle epilepsy. RS that occurs within other focal or generalized epilepsy syndromes that are associated with distinct spontaneous seizures are classified by the overarching seizure type. Most patients experience spontaneous seizures along with their provoked events. RS originate from stimulation of functional anatomic networks normally functioning for physiological activities, that overlap or coincide with regions of cortical hyperexcitability. Generalized RS typically occur within the setting of IGEs and should be considered as focal seizures with quick secondary generalization via cortico-cortical or cortico-reticular pathways. In aggregate, activation of a critical neuronal mass, supported and sustained by cortico-subcortical and thalamocortical pathways eventually result in a seizure. Treatment includes antiseizure medication, commonly valproate or levetiracetam, along with lifestyle modifications, and when amenable, surgical intervention. High clinical suspicion and careful history taking must be employed in all epilepsy patients to identify reflex triggers.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a fundamental physiological process, characterized by the activation of several cortical and subcortical neural networks. The relation between sleep and cardiovascular system is complex and bidirectional: sleep disor- ders may alter cardiovascular system, leading to an increased cardiovascular risk, while, on the contrary, cardio- vascular diseases are characterized by an alteration of physiological sleep. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a key role in the regulation of cardiovascular functions during different sleep stages, with sympatho-vagal balance dynamically shifting towards sympathetic or vagal predominance across different sleep stages. Sleep deprivation (SD) has becoming one of the most relevant health problem in modern societies. SD can be related to aging, which is associated with increased sleep fragmentation, and to sleep disorders, such as sleep disordered breathing and neurological disorders. Experimental studies in animals showed that SD significantly affects cardiovascular functions, altering heart rate and blood pressure responses, and increasing sympathetic activity and neuroendocrine response to stressor stimu- li. Clinical studies in humans have shown that SD, either due to experimental sleep loss and to sleep disorders, can affect different biological pathways, such as cardiovascular autonomic control, inflammation, immunity responses and metabolism. All these alterations may predispose subjects with SD to an increased cardiovascular risk. Hence, it is fundamental to identify the presence of a sleep disorder, which could be per se responsible for sleep loss, or the presence of sleep deprivation due to other factors, such as social life, habits etc., in order to identify subjects at high risk for cardiovascular events.",

      "title": "Effects of acute and chronic sleep deprivation on cardiovascular regulation",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a fundamental physiological process, characterized by the activation of several cortical and subcortical neural networks. The relation between sleep and cardiovascular system is complex and bidirectional: sleep disor- ders may alter cardiovascular system, leading to an increased cardiovascular risk, while, on the contrary, cardio- vascular diseases are characterized by an alteration of physiological sleep. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a key role in the regulation of cardiovascular functions during different sleep stages, with sympatho-vagal balance dynamically shifting towards sympathetic or vagal predominance across different sleep stages. Sleep deprivation (SD) has becoming one of the most relevant health problem in modern societies. SD can be related to aging, which is associated with increased sleep fragmentation, and to sleep disorders, such as sleep disordered breathing and neurological disorders. Experimental studies in animals showed that SD significantly affects cardiovascular functions, altering heart rate and blood pressure responses, and increasing sympathetic activity and neuroendocrine response to stressor stimu- li. Clinical studies in humans have shown that SD, either due to experimental sleep loss and to sleep disorders, can affect different biological pathways, such as cardiovascular autonomic control, inflammation, immunity responses and metabolism. All these alterations may predispose subjects with SD to an increased cardiovascular risk. Hence, it is fundamental to identify the presence of a sleep disorder, which could be per se responsible for sleep loss, or the presence of sleep deprivation due to other factors, such as social life, habits etc., in order to identify subjects at high risk for cardiovascular events.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A 34‐year‐old man without a past history of any psychiatric or neurological disorder developed severe anterograde amnesia following a psychological trauma. Initial assessment of neuropsychological functions 3 months after the psychological trauma indicated severe memory deficits for acquiring new information in both verbal and visual modalities with widespread cognitive deficits in attention, executive functions, and intellectual ability. Importantly, working and remote memory were intact. The case illustrates that psychogenic anterograde amnesia might be associated with a wider range of cognitive deficits. Possible neurobiological explanations are discussed to explain large cognitive impairments associated with anterograde psychogenic amnesia.",

In the ophthalmological context, the Charles Bonnet Syndrome (SCB) has been described characterized by the presence of complex visual hallucinations in patients with acquired visual deficits without psychological or psychiatric comorbidity, which may distinguish the unreal nature of the visions they experience. In the present study, the visual hallucinations and cognitive functioning of a group of subjects with acquired deficiency of visual acuity are described, providing evidence concerning the characteristics of these hallucinations and cognitive functioning in this group. Our findings indicate that the more frequent visual hallucinations are of elemental and stereotypicad type.

      "title": "Benign childhood focal epilepsies",
      "abstract": "Summary The idiopathic focal epilepsies comprise a group of syndromes characterized by focal‐onset seizures for which there is no detectable structural brain abnormality and for which there is a proposed functional mechanism for the epilepsy and electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities. This group includes benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE), benign epilepsy with occipital paroxysms (both early onset and late‐onset types), idiopathic photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy, and some less well‐defined syndromes. The limits of the early onset idiopathic occipital epilepsy syndrome are not clear, and perhaps this entity represents part of a larger syndrome group of “autonomic” age‐related epilepsies. The term “idiopathic” implies absence of a structural brain lesion and a genetic propensity to seizures. The term “benign” implies that the epileptic seizures are easily treated or require no treatment, show remission without sequelae with ultimate and definitive remission before adulthood, do not have severe or exceedingly disturbing seizures, and have no associated serious intellectual or behavioral disturbances. It may be that a syndrome is benign only when it can be recognized early with reasonable certainty, thereby avoiding unnecessary investigations, overtreatment, and lifestyle restrictions. Although BRE has such characteristic clinical and EEG features to make early recognition possible, this is less constantly so in the other focal idiopathic epilepsy syndromes, where the term “benign” may be inappropriate. Mild and selective neuropsychological impairment may occur even in those with typical syndromes but it is unclear whether such selective deficits outlast the active phase of epilepsy. Sometimes the clinical course may be complicated by obvious cognitive and language impairments. In such cases, the term benign is obviously inappropriate, even when seizures are rare. In most patients with the typical focal idiopathic epilepsy syndromes, medication is not necessary.",

There can be a basic syndrome of \"pure dysphasia\"; these children are very likely to have a genetically determined developmental disorder on a limited neuronal level (no cerebral damage of any kind) on a developmental disorder by other factors such as an abnormal cortical architecture and abnormal symmetry of the hemispheres. In somewhat more than half the patients, the basic syndrome of pure dysphasia is accompanied by other neurological signs, most of which are indicative of functional disorders of the left hemisphere. There can also be symptoms of the right hemisphere, of the corpus callosum and of the afferent pathway systems for auditory perception. The nature and causes of these anomalies can be multifarious, so that it is unfeasible to speak of the substrate or the pathogenesis.",

The causes of neurological deterioration after spinal cord injury are not well studied. Neurologic deterioration of acute, subacute, or chronic periods was reported in 2–10% of patients with cervical cord injuries and in 15% of patients with entire spinal cord injuries. Many patients with neurologically deterioration with spinal cord injuries are associated with surgical intervention: epidural hematoma not evacuated, attempted reduction of kyphosis, or intraoperative injury. Additional neurological deterioration may occur after several years, although it may occur in the initial weeks or months after spinal cord injury. It can have a serious negative impact on functional abilities and may lead to anxiety about further loss of functional independence and deterioration of function after adjustment to spinal cord injury. This chapter describes the relatively less rare causes of neurological deterioration that are reported or expected in patients with spinal cord injuries.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) share clinical and genetic components that have long been recognized. The two disorders co-occur more frequently than would be predicted by their respective prevalence, suggesting that a complex, multifactor association is involved. However, DSM-5 maintains the distinction between ASD, with core social and communication impairments, and SSD, including schizophrenia (SCZ), with hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder as essential features. ASD and SSD have common biological underpinnings that may emerge early in development and unfold over time. One of the hypotheses supporting the similarities in the social and cognitive disturbances of ASD and SSD relates to abnormalities in the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory cortical activity (E/I imbalance). E/I imbalance in neurodevelopmental disorders could be the consequence of abnormalities in genes coding for glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors or synaptic proteins followed by system derangements. SSD and ASD have been characterized as polygenic disorders in which to the onset and progression of disease is triggered by interactions among multiple genes. Mammalian target of rapamycin signaling is under intense investigation as a convergent altered pathway in the two spectrum disorders. Current understanding of shared and divergent patterns between ASD and SSD from molecular to clinical aspects is still incomplete and may be implemented by the research domain criteria approach.",

      "title": "Association of Pesticide Exposure with Neurologic Dysfunction and Disease",
      "abstract": "Poisoning by acute high-level exposure to certain pesticides has well-known neurotoxic effects, but whether chronic exposure to moderate levels of pesticides is also neurotoxic is more controversial. Most studies of moderate pesticide exposure have found increased prevalence of neurologic symptoms and changes in neurobehavioral performance, reflecting cognitive and psychomotor dysfunction. There is less evidence that moderate exposure is related to deficits in sensory or motor function or peripheral nerve conduction, but fewer studies have considered these outcomes. It is possible that the most sensitive manifestation of pesticide neurotoxicity is a general malaise lacking in specificity and related to mild cognitive dysfunction, similar to that described for Gulf War syndrome. Most studies have focused on organophosphate insecticides, but some found neurotoxic effects from other pesticides, including fungicides, fumigants, and organochlorine and carbamate insecticides. Pesticide exposure may also be associated with increased risk of Parkinson disease; several classes of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, have been implicated. Studies of other neurodegenerative diseases are limited and inconclusive. Future studies will need to improve assessment of pesticide exposure in individuals and consider the role of genetic susceptibility. More studies of pesticides other than organophosphates are needed. Major unresolved issues include the relative importance of acute and chronic exposure, the effect of moderate exposure in the absence of poisoning, and the relationship of pesticide-related neurotoxicity to neurodegenerative disease.",

Sudden (lapses) and gradual changes in cognitive performance occur with sleep deprivation or with time of day. The time course of human cognitive processes throughout the day is relevant to the programming of different human activities. The lowest level of cognitive performance occurs during nighttime and early in the morning, a better level occurs around noon, and even higher levels occur during afternoon and evening hours. However, this time course can be modulated by conditions such as chronotype, sleep deprivation, sleep disorders or medication that affects the central nervous system.",

A total of 394 children &amp;#x3c;28 weeks of gestation who survived to discharge from 2011 to 2018 received neurodevelopmental assessment at corrected age of 24 months. Severe ROP was defined as ROP of stages 2 plus or worse, or recipients of retinal therapy, and mild ROP as stage 1 or 2 in at least one eye. NDI was defined as cognitive or motor impairment using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, moderate to severe cerebral palsy, or profound hearing loss. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Among the 374 children validated for analysis, 157 children (42%) had non-ROP, 145 (39%) mild ROP, and 72 (19%) severe ROP. As ROP severity increased progressively from non-ROP, to mild ROP, and to severe ROP, the rates of NDI increased from 25%, to 46%, and to 61%. The multivariable logistic regression showed that the model included three levels of ROP, and neonatal morbidities achieved better overall performance for NDI than the model that included neonatal morbidities alone. Compared with non-ROP, mild ROP and severe ROP had adjusted odds ratios of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.10–3.28) and 2.75 (95% CI: 1.33–5.67) for NDI, respectively. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Mild ROP and severe ROP are independent neonatal morbidities associated with NDI. Neurodevelopmental follow-up of extremely preterm children with any stage of ROP is needed.",

      "title": "White matters - The influence of cerebral small-vessel disease on depression, cognition and functioning",
      "abstract": "Depression and cognitive impairment are highly prevalent in later life, and frequently co-occur. One of the possible mechanisms that may underlie both conditions is the presence of cerebral small-vessel disease. The presence of cerebral small-vessel disease is strongly associated with common vascular risk factors, and is characterized by white matter lesions and lacunar infarcts on brain MRI. The 'vascular depression' hypothesis proposes that disruption of emotion-regulating frontal-subcortical pathways is an underlying mechanism by which cerebral small-vessel disease may precipitate or predispose to late-life depression. In this thesis, we investigated the influence of cerebral small-vessel disease on MRI on depressive symptoms, cognitive performance and self-rated functioning in patients with atherosclerotic disease. Our major findings were that: 1) Poorer self-rated functioning is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with atherosclerotic disease, and patients with lacunar infarcts are particularly vulnerable for the adverse effect of poorer self-rated mental functioning on mortality; 2) The influence of white matter lesions, infarcts and atrophy on depressive symptoms and cognitive performance depends on lesion location rather than on lesion severity. We found that subcortical infarcts in deep white matter tracts were associated with depressive symptoms, poorer executive functioning and memory. Periventricular white matter lesions, cortical infarcts and atrophy were associated with poorer executive functioning and slowed processing speed, but not with depressive symptoms; 3) The depressive symptoms associated with cerebral small-vessel disease in frontal and deep white matter tracts are primarily characterized by motivational problems and not by mood problems; 4) The motivational problems associated with cerebral small-vessel disease are also present in patients without major depression, suggesting that these may be expressions of 'vascular apathy' rather than 'vascular depression'; 5) In persons without dementia, apathy is related to both cerebral small-vessel disease and neurodegeneration, and may therefore also be an early manifestation of cognitive decline",

      "title": "Diagnostic guidelines for bipolar depression: a probabilistic approach",
      "abstract": "Objectives: There are currently no accepted diagnostic criteria for bipolar depression for either research or clinical purposes. This paper aimed to develop recommendations for diagnostic criteria for bipolar I depression. Methods: Studies on the clinical characteristics of bipolar and unipolar depression were reviewed. To identify relevant papers, literature searches using PubMed and Medline were undertaken. Results: There are no pathognomonic characteristics of bipolar I depression compared to unipolar depressive disorder. There are, however, replicated findings of clinical characteristics that are more common in both bipolar I depression and unipolar depressive disorder, respectively, or which are observed in unipolar‐depressed patients who ‘convert’ (i.e., who later develop hypo/manic symptoms) to bipolar disorder over time. The following features are more common in bipolar I depression (or in unipolar ‘converters’ to bipolar disorder): ‘atypical’ depressive features such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis; psychomotor retardation; psychotic features, and/or pathological guilt; and lability of mood. Furthermore, bipolar‐depressed patients are more likely to have an earlier age of onset of their first depressive episode, to have more prior episodes of depression, to have shorter depressive episodes, and to have a family history of bipolar disorder. The following features are more common in unipolar depressive disorder: initial insomnia/reduced sleep; appetite, and/or weight loss; normal or increased activity levels; somatic complaints; later age of onset of first depressive episode; prolonged episodes; and no family history of bipolar disorder. Conclusions: Rather than proposing a categorical diagnostic distinction between bipolar depression and major depressive disorder, we would recommend a ‘probabilistic’ (or likelihood) approach. While there is no ‘point of rarity’ between the two presentations, there is, rather, a differential likelihood of experiencing the above symptoms and signs of depression. A table outlining draft proposed operationalized criteria for such an approach is provided. The specific details of such a probabilistic approach need to be further explored. For example, to be useful, any diagnostic innovation should inform treatment choices.",

      "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder, showing various combination of progressive autonomic failure, cerebellar ataxia, and levodopa poorly responsive parkinsonism. MSA accounts for more than 40% of spinocerebellar ataxias in Japan. Pathologically, myelinopathy, neuronal loss and gliosis are the cardinal features in the brain of MSA. In addition, excessive accumulation of alpha-synuclein, mostly in oligodendroglia and partly in neuron, characterizes the cellular pathology of the disorder. However, mechanism causing the disorder is not known. Clinical diagnosis of MSA is based on Quinn's criteria or, more recently, on Consensus Criteria. In Japan, criteria of the Research Committee of Ataxic Diseases, the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, was popular, and it contributed to the research base on MSA. Besides the major manifestations incorporated into those criteria, various dystonic manifestation, rhythmic myoclonus, emotional incontinence, sleep disturbance, sleep-related movement disturbances, and signs of vasomotor dysfunction, provide aids in the differential diagnosis of MSA. In neuroimaging studies, not only MRI but dopamine transporter and D2 receptor imaging by SPECT also contribute to the diagnosis of MSA. These laboratory diagnostic procedures can contribute to improve reliability of the diagnosis, and needs to be taken into account when preventive measures become available.",

      "abstract": "The fundamental purpose of sleep remains one of the most compelling questions yet to be answered in the area of neuroscience, if not all of biology. A pervasive behavior among members of the animal kingdom, the functional necessity of engaging regularly in sleep is best demonstrated by showing that failing to do so leads to a broad repertoire of pathological outcomes including cognitive, immunological, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes, among others. Indeed, an absolute requirement for sleep has been shown in studies that have demonstrated that continuous total deprivation of sleep for as short a period as 15 days is generally lethal in some species. The most common clinical sleep disorder, insomnia, is both a principal disease (primary insomnia) as well as a co-morbidity of a large number of other ostensibly unrelated diseases including chronic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. From a treatment perspective, restoring normal healthy sleep delivers subsequent benefits in waking cognitive function and mood with the potential for beneficial therapeutic impact on daily functioning across multiple diseases for which restorative healthy sleep is compromised. Our remarkable escalation in understanding the anatomy and physiology of sleep/wake control mechanisms provides new opportunities to modify the neurobiology of sleep and wake-related behaviors in novel and exciting ways. In parallel, expansion of sleep research into novel interfaces between sleep-wake biology and disease states is revealing additional extensive implications of lost sleep. Current investigational and conventional pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep and wake disorders are discussed based on their mechanism of action within the CNS and their effect on sleep and wake. This review of recent sleep biology and sleep pharmacology peers into the future of sleep therapeutics to highlight both mechanistic safety and functional outcomes as key for differentiating and establishing success for the next generation of arousal modifying therapeutics.

People having frequent absence seizures may present as having withdrawn behavior, fragmented thought processes which may be mistaken for a psychosis, attention-deficit disorder with motor over activity, or, if the frequency of the seizures is variable, attention seeking behavior. It is important to be aware of the possibility of reversible, state-dependent cognitive impairment in an individual who is in a constant postictal state from frequent seizures. Reducing the seizure frequency can improve cognitive function markedly. It has become evident that a number of children who present with markedly autistic features have unsuspected epileptiform discharges either during the day or at night. If frequent epileptiform discharges are found in association with cognitive or behavioral problems then early, energetic treatment should be initiated.",

Patients present with features of headache, confusion or decreased consciousness, visual complaints, and sometimes seizures of acute or subacute onset. The underlying etiology or inciting factors are variable, the most common being hypertension, renal disease, and immunosuppressive drugs. They are diagnosed based on the common radiologic finding of bilateral posterior cerebral white matter edema. Other radiologic findings may also be present. Such patients may present first to an ophthalmologist with complaints of sudden onset of defective vision or double vision. It is a reversible entity if identified early. Hence, high index of suspicion, quick diagnosis, and management are important. Here, we present the case of a 23-year-old primigravida with chronic hypertension who presented with sudden onset of defective vision followed by headache. Visual acuity was only perception of hand movements in both eyes. Ophthalmologic evaluation showed no abnormality to account for the visual loss. Brain imaging showed bilateral parieto-occipital white matter edema consistent with clinical diagnosis of PRES. After treatment of hypertension and supportive measures, the patient’s symptoms recovered, and her vision was 6/6 in both eyes on 1-week follow-up. Follow-up MRI also showed resolution of edema.",

The key signs and symptoms are the acute onset of sustained rotatory vertigo without hearing loss, postural imbalance with Romberg's sign, and peripheral type nystagmus. Head thrust and caloric tests show ipsilateral hyporesponsiveness, but hearing test shows normal. Either an inflammation of the vestibular nerve or labyrinthine ischemia was proposed as a cause of vestibular neuritis. Recovery after vestibular neuritis is usually incomplete. Despite the assumed viral cause, the effects of corticosteroids, antiviral agents, or the two in combination are uncertain. Bilateral vestibulopathy is a rare disorder of the peripheral labyrinth or the eighth nerve. The most frequent etiologies include ototoxicity, autoimmune disorders, meningitis, neuropathies, sequential vestibular neuritis, cerebellar degeneration, tumors, and miscellaneous otological diseases. The two key symptoms are unsteadiness of gait and oscillopsia associated with head movements or when walking. The diagnosis is made with the simple bedside tests for defective vestibulo-ocular reflex (head thrust and dynamic visual acuity tests). Bilateral vestibulopathy is confirmed by the absence of nystagmus reaction to both caloric and rotatory chair tests. The spontaneous recovery is relatively rare and incomplete. Vestibular rehabilitation is supportive of the improvement, but the efficacy of physical therapy is limited.",

Non-rapid eye movement sleep promotes epileptic activity, while rapid eye movement sleep suppresses it. Seizures can be triggered by sleep, while sleep deprivation increases seizure susceptibility. Epilepsy disrupts sleep architecture and quality, leading to sleep disturbances and comorbidities, like sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. Excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue can result from epilepsy and the sedating effects of antiseizure medications. Sleep-related epilepsy exhibits seizures predominantly during sleep, with specific patterns related to sleep stages. Antiseizure medications can directly impact sleep quality and should be carefully considered when treating epilepsy patients with comorbid sleep disorders. Understanding the bidirectional relationship between sleep and epilepsy is crucial for effective management. Optimizing treatment strategies requires recognizing the effects of antiseizure medications on sleep, and addressing sleep-related issues in individuals with epilepsy.",

The current study aimed at investigating the relationship between motor symptom lateralization and cognitive performance in PD patients without the possible confounding effect of dopaminergic drugs, which may enhance or impair cognition on the basis of assessed function and disease stage. From the initial sample of 137 consecutive newly diagnosed drug-naïve (de novo) PD patients, clinical follow-ups and neurological examinations identified 108 right-handed patients with a unilateral motor presentation or a clear motor asymmetry (59 right-PD: 54.6%; 49 left-PD: 45.4%). Any cognitive difference emerged between right-PD patients and left-PD patients at this disease stage. Scores of lateralized motor impairment severity correlated with some cognitive performances: Right motor impairment correlated with a measure of set shifting (Trail Making Test B-A), and left motor impairment correlated with phonemic fluency and tasks with visuospatial material (Colored Progressive Matrices of Raven, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Copy and Immediate Recall). Findings of the current study supported the conclusion that the side of clinical motor predominance scarcely influences cognition in the early untreated stages of PD, suggesting that cognitive differences between subgroups of lateralized PD patients probably may appear in more advanced disease stages.",

      "title": "Is Delirium the Cognitive Harbinger of Frailty in Older Adults? A Review about the Existing Evidence",
      "abstract": "Frailty is a clinical syndrome defined by the age-related depletion of the individual's homeostatic reserves, determining an increased susceptibility to stressors and disproportionate exposure to negative health changes. The physiological systems that are involved in the determination of frailty are mutually interrelated, so that when decline starts in a given system, implications may also regard the other systems. Indeed, it has been shown that the number of abnormal systems is more predictive of frailty than those of the abnormalities in any particular system. Delirium is a transient neurocognitive disorder, characterized by an acute onset and fluctuating course, inattention, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral abnormalities, that complicates one out of five hospital admissions. Delirium is independently associated with the same negative outcomes of frailty and, like frailty, its pathogenesis is usually multifactorial, depending on complex inter-relationships between predisposing and precipitating factors. By definition, a somatic cause should be identified, or at least suspected, to diagnose delirium. Delirium and frailty potentially share multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms and pathways, meaning that they could be thought of as the two sides to the same coin. This review aims at summarizing the existing evidence, referring both to human and animal models, to postulate that delirium may represent the cognitive harbinger of a state of frailty in older persons experiencing an acute clinical event.",

      "abstract": "In spite of the advancement of neonatology over the past 25 years, neonatal neurological deficits still occur. Rehabilitation professionals are required to assess neonatal neurological status and screen high risk infants. The indicators to predict developmental outcomes of the high risk infants in the neonatal periods are; 1) perinatal risk factors, 2) neurological examination, 3) general movements, and 4) neurobehavioral assessment. Severe complications of the central nervous system are risk factors for major neurologic problems. Particularly, periventricular leukomalacia and periventricular hemorrhage are significant predictors of subsequent cerebral palsy. Ultrasound brain scan, CT and MRI have helped in the non-invasive detection of brain damage in young preterm infants. Social class is related to problems in the primary school. The traditional neurological examination consists of the grading of the state, muscle tonus, posture, spontaneous movements, reflexes, and other neurological abnormalities such as neonatal seizures, repeated apnea, oral-motor dysfunction, or high-pitched cry. Qualitative assessment of general movement has been shown to be a good predictor of neurologic outcome in high risk preterm infants. Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale combines both behavioral and neurological approaches. The following points should be kept in mind when assessing infants in the neonatal period. 1) To predict subsequent disabilities, we must consider findings of various assessment methods comprehensively. 2) The assessment should be designed to be easy, reliable, and non-invasive. 3) Children must be followed up at least until they enter primary schools.",

      "title": "Exercise Intolerance: How Do We Know and Test?",
      "abstract": "Exercise intolerance is defined as the reduced ability to perform activities involving movement of skeletal muscles due to symptoms of dyspnea or fatigue. Patients can be suffered during exercise or later. Dogs presented to veterinarians for perceived exercise intolerance may have decreased strength, speed, or stamina. Signs can sometimes be subtle, with suboptimal performance detected by the owner but it is difficult to detect by inexperienced observers. Alternatively, the signs may include profound exercise-induced weakness, episodes of collapse, or even death following exercise. Exercise intolerance can result from cardiovascular, orthopedic, respiratory, hematologic, metabolic/endocrine, neuromuscular, muscular and neurologic disorders. Therefore, a veterinarian has to utilize information received from history taking, physical examination, and some particular diagnostic tools/tests in order to find the etiology. A complete history investigating abnormalities of all body system is essential. It is important to clarify nature of clinical signs and to determine whether clinical signs are associated with physical activity. If possible, a veterinarian should observe the dog during an episode that the owner perceives as exercise intolerance directly or from a videotape. Clinical signs of coughing, dyspnea, collapse, or cyanosis may suggest cardiovascular, respiratory or neurologic dysfunction. Physical examination at rest should be performed since many dogs with exercise intolerance have abnormal physical examination findings at rest. Complete examination of respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and nervous system are advised. It is important to systematically rule out of each previously mentioned system. Cardiovascular disorder: Dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF) regardless the cause will eventually have exercise intolerance due to pumping failure and poor tissue perfusion. Consequently, tissues do not receive adequate oxygen and the muscles fatigue more easily. These dogs will typically display clinical evidence of cardiac failure at rest, including tachycardia, cough, weak femoral pulses, crackles on lung auscultation from pulmonary congestion or edema, and perhaps cyanosis and a murmur, arrhythmia, pulse deficits, and prolonged capillary refill time may be observed. Standard diagnostic methods for CVS disorder including auscultation, thoracic radiographs, ECG and Echocardiography should be all performed. Abnormal serum lactate may be found in dogs with muscle fatigue. The sixminute walk test (6-MWT) has been a gold standard method in human medicine to predict morbidity and mortality of patient with heart failure. The 6-MWT directly measures a patient’s ability to carry out daily activities instead of a patient’s ability to performed laboratory exercise such as on treadmill. The 6-MWT in dogs is also evidenced and demonstrated a significant decreased in the distance walked in 6 minutes when a dog has CHF. This method is simple and may be a valuable tool when assessing quality of life in CHF dogs. Respiratory disorder: Defects of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, airways, pulmonary parenchyma, or pleural space can impair a dog's ability to breathe normally. When these dogs exercise, they are unable to maintain tissue oxygenation resulting in weakness, exercise intolerance, or collapse. Cyanosis, abnormal lung sounds, abnormal upper airway sounds, or dyspnea may be recognized. Observation of breathing pattern and auscultation at rest, during and after exercise are helpful in identifying a problem within the respiratory tract. Thoracic radiographs should be done in all dogs with exercise intolerance. In addition, heartworm testing, laryngoscopy, tracheal wash for cytology and culture, thoracocentesis or bronchoscopy and arterial blood gas should be performed to evaluate the respiratory system as necessary to reach a diagnosis. Hematologic disorder: Regardless of any cause resulting in bleeding, dogs usually will not exhibit exercise intolerance due to anemia unless their hematocrit fall below 20%. Dogs may exhibit a sudden collapse or profound weakness rather than repeated episodes of inability to exercise. Chronic anemia can be tolerated but, if severe, can result in classic signs of exercise intolerance. Chronic anemia is most often seen in urinary bleeding, bone marrow disease or cancer. All dogs with exercise intolerance should be tested for a complete blood count. Abnormality of metabolic/endocrine system: Hypoglycemia is an important cause of weakness and exercise intolerance in dogs. Most often causes of hypoglycemia in dogs include tumors of pancreases, liver failure, sepsis, hypoadrenocorticism. Hypoglycemia should be documented by collecting a blood sample at the time of collapse. However, intense hypoglycemia is most likely to be verified after a 24or 48-hour fast. If hypoglycemia is confirmed, affected dogs should be tested for hypoadrenocorticism, liver dysfunction, and neoplasia. Thoracic radiographs and abdominal Proceedings of the 14 Chulalongkorn University Veterinary Conference CUVC 2015: Responsible for Lives April 20-22, 2015, Bangkok, Thailand 6 ultrasonography are recommended to confirm metastasis. Neuromuscular abnormalities: Myasthenia Gravis is an immune-mediated disorder in which selfantibodies attack acetylcholine receptors of skeletal muscle. The clinical signs of affected dogs include weakness of limbs muscle that become worsen when dogs exercise. Dogs with MG usually exhibit severe exercise intolerant, developing weakness and collapse even after walking only a few steps. Response to edrophonium chloride may help to establish a clinical diagnosis of myasthenia gravis while the results of confirmative antibody against are also required. Serum antibodies to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are detected in most dogs with MG. Orthopedic disorders: Pain from abnormalities of the bones or joints causes reluctance to exercise in affected dog. Besides reluctance to walk or exercise, other clinical signs include, fever, and lethargy. Lameness, joint swelling, and joint pain can be inconsistent, so best diagnosis is to perform arthrocentesis with cytology and bacterial culture. There are many etiologies of orthopedics disorder. Therefore, a veterinarian must differential diagnosis based on history and physical examination. For instance, hypertrophic osteodystrophy, or osteochondritis dissecans often found in young dogs. Whereas, aged dogs may have problems with ligamentous injuries or degenerative joint disease. Polyarthritis is another most common causes of joint pain and reluctance to exercise in dogs. Immunemediated nonerosive polyarthritis (IMPA) is the most common cause of polyarthritis in dogs. In conclusion, Diagnostic evaluation of dogs with exercise intolerance will vary based on determination historical features, physical exam findings at rest and also laboratory results. If there are no abnormalities at rest, a veterinarian may let dogs to perform exercise. It is important to further investigate the underlying problem systematically to rule out metabolic, orthopedic, respiratory and/or cardiac causes of exercise intolerance as well as muscular, neuromuscular and neurologic disorders. Once the cause of exercise intolerance has been identified, plans for treatment or management can be initiated. References 1. Boddy KN et al 2004. Am J Vet Res. 65(3): 311- 313. 2. Chan DL. 2008.

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SPTLC1-related hereditary sensory neuropathy (HSN) is an axonal form of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy distinguished by prominent early sensory loss and later positive sensory phenomena including dysesthesia and characteristic lightning or pains. Loss of sensation can lead to painless injuries, which, if unrecognized, result in slow wound healing and subsequent osteomyelitis requiring distal amputations. Motor involvement is present in all advanced cases and can be severe. After age 20 years, the distal wasting and weakness may involve proximal muscles, possibly leading to wheelchair dependency by the seventh or eighth decade. Sensorineural hearing loss is variable. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SPTLC1-related HSN is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features and identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SPTLC1 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Clean and protect wounds on neuropathic limbs; surgical treatment similar to that for leprosy; ankle/foot orthotics for foot drop; arthrodesis for Charcot joints; pregabalin, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or amitryptiline, or a combination of an antiepileptic drug and an antidepressant drug for shooting pains. Prevention of secondary complications: Routine care by a diabetic foot care specialist to prevent/treat calluses and foot ulcers; education about good skin care and burn prevention (e.g., to hands when cooking). Surveillance: At least daily inspection of feet for injuries or sources of wear. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Opiates as SPTLC1-related HSN is a chronic disorder. Genetic counseling SPTLC1-related HSN is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most probands have an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the SPTLC1 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in the family.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive episodes of sleeprelated upper airway obstructions, which usually are associated with oxygen desaturation. A special situation of abnormal sleep disorders in the elderly is degenerative diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple systems atrophy (MSA), and prion diseases all pose different challenges and disruptions to sleep.

Subcortical dementia occurs in degenerative extrapyramidal disorders and has also been identified in inflammatory, infectious, and vascular conditions. Histologic, metabolic, and neurochemical investigations implicate dysfunction primarily of subcortical neurotransmitter systems and subcortical structures or subcortical-frontal connections in the genesis of the syndrome. Subcortical dementia contrasts neuropsychologically and anatomically with disorders such as dementia of the Alzheimer type that affect primarily the cerebral cortex. The clinical characteristics of subcortical dementia reflect the interruption of fundamental functions (motivation, mood, timing, arousal) mediated by phylogenetically and ontogenetically early maturing structures.",

Retrobulbar optic neuritis secondary to multiple sclerosis is the most common disease (neuropathy) of the optic nerve in young adults and often the first clinical manifestation of multiple sclerosis. Despite a characteristic triad of symptoms and evident focal demyelination in brain magnetic resonance, misdiagnoses still occur. Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (atrophy) is a genetic mitochondrial disease, which manifests as a subacute painless loss of vision, and thus can be mistaken for retrobulbar optic neuritis. The coexistence of hereditary optic neuropathy and Harding’s syndrome is another diagnostic difficulty. All these three conditions, the peak of incidence of which occurs in the second to third decade of life, initially manifest only with visual symptoms due to uni- or bilateral optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain may show demyelination, while optical coherence tomography of the fundus may detect thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layers in all these neuropathies. We present clinical differences, as well as variances in retinal optical coherence tomography and magnetic resonance imaging between retrobulbar optic neuritis secondary to multiple sclerosis, Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, and Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy with multiple sclerosis-like disease.",

Psychiatric manifestations have a high prevalence in MS patients and may worsen the illness progression and the patients' quality of life (QoL). Depression is a highly prevalent condition in MS patients, associated with poorer adherence to treatment, decreased functional status and QoL, and increased suicide risk. Diagnosis and treatment of this disorder is challenging because of symptom overlap. Other prevalent psychiatric comorbidities are anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, substance misuse and personality disorders. As the illness progresses, personality changes can happen, as well as affect abnormalities. Cognitive changes occur frequently in MS patients, and affect features like processing speed, attention, learning, memory, visual spatial capabilities, and some language deficits. Disease-modifying treatments may reduce cognitive impairment because of their container action on the brain's lesion burden. Other QoL determinants such as fatigue, pain, sexual dysfunction, exercise, resilience and social support should be taken into account, in order to promote the individuals' well-being. Further studies are needed in order to elucidate the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and more neuroimaging studies are required to clarify the relationship between structural changes and psychiatric comorbidities.",

Other parasomnias include sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning, exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder. The latter shares many features with the disorders of arousals, being frequently associated to sleepwalking. Hence, parasomnias comprise a variety of abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, dreaming, and autonomic phenomena that emerge from sleep as an expression of an anomalous central nervous system activation during sleep.",

Presenting concerns and clinical findings:A healthy, fully vaccinated, 11-year-old boy presented with one day of progressive headache, non-bilious emesis and worsening confusion with generalized weakness.There was no associated syncope, seizure, preceding trauma or difficulty breathing.He had no recent fever, weight loss, night sweats, neck stiffness or cough.There was no recent travel and no exposure to medications or toxic/recreational substances.Prior to the onset of his symptoms, the patient was described by parents as a healthy and happy boy active in soccer.There was no family history of autoimmune disease.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are a group of sleep disorders that are characterized by the presence of undesirable behavioral, experiential, or autonomic nervous system events during sleep initiation, within sleep, or during arousals from any stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. During wakefulness and NREM sleep, the hypothalamus plays a central role in thermoregulation. REM sleep has a very distinct thermoregulatory response that is characterized by an inhibition of hypothalamic control over body temperature, with resulting poikilothermia. The role of the thermoregulatory features of REM sleep is currently unknown. Drawing conclusions from other parasomnias one can assume that a disorder could exist in which the thermoregulatory features of REM sleep are impaired. The existence of this condition may have eluded current research because most of the research on thermoregulation has been completed using animal models or healthy volunteers. If this disorder were to exist, it could be associated with metabolic disorders, or with neurodegenerative conditions, and perhaps it could be an early biomarker for alpha-synucleinopathies in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder. New and evolving wearable technologies offer the promise of facilitating the monitoring of core body temperature and the testing of this hypothesized thermoregulatory autonomic disorder and its clinical correlates.",

The relationship of these measures to mood state, medication status, and cognitive function was investigated. Sixty-one patients with type I bipolar disorder and 67 comparison subjects were tested.Results indicated a deficit in dot motion trajectory discrimination in both euthymic and ill individuals with bipolar disorder, as well as a global deficit in moving grating contrast sensitivity. Ill individuals with bipolar disorder were impaired in psychomotor processing, but this finding was not related to visual processing performance.These findings could be due to disturbances in specific visual pathways involved in the processing of motion properties, or to a more general deficit which impairs processing of temporally modulated stimuli.",

      "abstract": "The autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis can mimic a variety of neurological disorders leading to a delay in diagnosis and treatment. In the older population, due to confusion with signs of the ageing process or comorbidities due to ageing, there are many underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed cases of myasthenia gravis. A majority of myasthenia gravis symptoms appear as ocular or motor symptoms and there are very few cases of bulbar symptoms. We present a case of myasthenia gravis with only hypophonia as a clinical feature.We present a case of a 51-year-old Madheshi woman whose only complaint was sudden onset of hypophonia which later showed a fluctuating nature throughout the daytime. There was only reduced pitch in her voice with no nasal tone or dysarthria (so-called dysphonia), which created a diagnostic dilemma. Later, a neurological examination and other relevant investigations suggested myasthenia gravis.Sudden onset and focal neurological deficit can raise the diagnostic dilemma of myasthenia gravis. Relevant laboratory tests and clinical examinations are important to diagnose this disease properly. In resources-deprived nations like Nepal, where several investigations are expensive and access to them is difficult, it becomes very difficult to achieve a solid diagnosis for rare presentations of diseases.",

      "abstract": "The development of new medications for the treatment of schizophrenia is closely tied to the concept of the disorder and its characteristic symptoms. In recent years, the symptoms have been divided into two broad categories: positive and negative. Positive symptoms tend to command clinical attention and to be treatment-responsive, while negative symptoms are more insidious and disabling, but less spectacular. Negative symptoms, which are similar to the core symptoms of schizophrenia defined by Krapaelin and Bleuler, have not received much attention until recently because of concern about reliability. However, rating scales with good reliability are now available for use in clinical and neurobiological studies. Clinical drug trials are also meeting the challenge of documenting the response to carefully rated negative symptoms. In addition, they are exploring the effects of medication on negative symptoms that are primary rather than secondary to reduced extrapyramidal side effects, or of medication that lowers levels of depression or decreases the demoralizing effects of positive symptoms. One ideal strategy for identifying the effects of medication on primary negative symptoms is to study patients with high levels of negative symptoms and low levels of positive symptoms, who are in the early stages of the illness and have been given minimal treatment with classical neuroleptics. Such samples are highly informative, but difficult to collect. Alternatively, when all confounders cannot be eliminated, the effects of medication can be explored using statistical techniques to examine covariance",

      "abstract": "Nocturnal and sleep-related motor disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a wide spectrum of manifestations and present a complex clinical picture. Problems can arise due to impaired movement ability (hypokinesias), e.g. nocturnal hypokinesia or early-morning akinesia, or to excessive movement (hyperkinesias), e.g. end-of-the-day dyskinesia, parasomnias, periodic limb movement during sleep and restless legs syndrome. These disorders can have a significant negative impact on the sleep, daytime functional ability, and overall quality of life of individuals with PD and their carers. The debilitating motor issues are often accompanied by a combination of non-motor symptoms, including pain and cramping, which add to the overall burden. Importantly, nocturnal motor disorders encompass a broader timeline than just the period of sleep, often starting in the evening, as well as occurring throughout the night and on awakening, and are not just limited to problems of insomnia or sleep fragmentation. Diagnosis can be challenging as, in many cases, the 'gold standard' assessment method is video polysomnography, which may not be available in all settings. Various validated questionnaires are available to support evaluation, and alternative approaches, using wearable sensors and digital technology, are now being developed to facilitate early diagnosis and monitoring. This review sets out the parameters of what can be considered normal nocturnal movement and describes the clinical manifestations, usual clinical or objective assessment methods, and evidence for optimal management strategies for the common nocturnal motor disorders that neurologists will encounter in people with PD in their clinical practice.",

Here, we describe clinical picture of sleep disorders in AD and the relation between sleep disorders and both cognitive impairment and poor prognosis of the disease. There are difficulties of the diagnosis of sleep disorders based on sleep questionnaires, polysomnography or actigraphy in the AD patients. Typical disturbances of the neurophysiological sleep architecture in the course of the AD include deep sleep and paradoxical sleep deprivation. Among sleep disorders occurring in patients with AD, the most frequent disorders are sleep breathing disorders – mainly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome and restless legs syndrome/periodic legs movements' syndrome. Sleep disorders may influence circadian fluctuations of the concentrations of amyloid-β in the interstitial brain fluid and in the cerebrovascular fluid related to the glymphatic brain system and production of the amyloid-β. There is accumulating evidence suggesting that disordered sleep contributes to cognitive decline and the development of AD pathology. In this mini-review, we highlight and discuss the association between sleep disorders and AD.",

      "title": "Cognitive Impairment in Schizophrenia Is the Core of the Disorder",
      "abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia exhibit an exceedingly wide range of symptoms from a variety of domains. The cardinal features are abnormal ideas (such as delusions); abnormal perceptions (such as hallucinations); formal thought disorder (as evidenced by disorganized speech); motor, volitional, and behavioral disorders; and emotional disorders (such as affective flattening or inappropriateness). In addition to these diverse, and sometimes bizarre symptoms, it has become increasingly apparent that the disorder is, to variable degrees, accompanied by a broad spectrum of cognitive impairments. This review addresses the question of whether the cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenic patients are the core features of the disorder. In other words, we explore whether schizophrenia is best characterized by symptoms or cognitive deficits (we suggest the latter) and moreover, whether there is a specific cognitive deficit profile that may assist in diagnosis. First, we discuss what the cognitive deficits are. Then we address in turn the reality, frequency, predictive validity, specificity, course and susceptibility to neuroleptic effects of these cognitive impairments. In brief, we argue that various cognitive deficits are enduring features of the schizophrenia illness, that they are not state-related and are not specific to subtypes of the illness, and, more specifically, that working memory and attention are characteristically impaired in patients with schizophrenia, irrespective of their level of intelligence. Last, we conclude that problems in these cognitive domains are at the very core of the dysfunction in this disease.",

At least two expert examiners are required to make the brain death determination. It is advisable to involve an independent examiner not involved in the patient's care or the recovery of donated organs. The objective of this chapter is to present updated guidelines for the process of brain death determination. All brain and brainstem functions should be absent on neurological examination including cerebral response to external stimuli and brain stem reflexes. An apnea test should be performed in all patients. However, if the clinical criteria cannot be applied, other confirmatory ancillary tests are required, particularly EEG and radionuclide scan. They are also needed to supplement the clinical assessment in young children. EEG is more reliable in the setting of hypotension or with disorders that lower intracranial pressure.

This broad definition does not provide information about the underlying disease process, an aspect of clinical care that is of increasing importance, as therapeutic development inches closer to effective disease-modifying treatments. The most common neurodegenerative dementias include Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson's disease dementia. Although rare, the prion diseases constitute an important group of dementias that should be routinely considered in the evaluation. Over the last two decades, advances in neuroimaging, biomarker development, and neurogenetics have not only led to a better understanding of the biology of these diseases, but they have improved our awareness of less common clinical subtypes of dementia. As such, to best define the disease process, the evaluation of a patient with cognitive decline requires attention to a myriad of disease aspects, such as the primary symptom at onset (memory, language, visual perception, praxis, etc.), the age at onset (younger or older than 65 years), the rate of disease progression (weeks to months or years), the cognitive and behavioral profile (neuropsychological assessment), and involvement of physical findings. We present here three cases that highlight the decision-making process in the evaluation of patients with atypical presentations of dementia.",

When these are the exclusive symptoms, they constitute uncomplicated OCD. OCD may also occur in the context of other neuropsychiatric disorders, most commonly other anxiety and mood disorders. The question remains as to whether these combinations of disorders should be regarded as independent, cooccurring disorders or as different manifestations of an incompletely understood constellation of OCD spectrum disorders with a common etiology. Additional considerations are given here to two potential etiology-based subgroups: (i) an environmentally based group in which OCD occurs following apparent causal events such as streptococcal infections, brain injury, or atypical neuroleptic treatment; and (ii) a genomically based group in which OCD is related to chromosomal anomalies or specific genes. Considering the status of current research, the concept of OCD and OCD-related spectrum conditions seems fluid in 2010, and in need of ongoing reappraisal.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Essential tremor has not been defined or used consistently in clinical diagnosis and research. Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Conversion disorder has one or more symptoms that affect voluntary motor or sensory function suggesting a neurological or other medical condition, but they are inconsistent with known neurological or musculoskeletal pathologies. Individuals with conversion disorder do not intentionally produce or feign their symptoms. Instead, the symptoms are due to an unconscious expression of a psychological conflict or need. There might be associated primary and secondary gains which act as maintaining factors. The disorder is more common in adolescence than in childhood. CASE REPORT: A 17 years old male reported to the Emergency Department alleged history of fall from a 10 feet wall c/o neck pain, inability to move all 4 limbs, diminished sensation below the neck. Cervical immobilization was done and his vitals & routine blood investigations were found to be normal. No signs of any urinary retention or fecal incontinence. Routine neurological examination was performed which revealed hypotonia in all 4 limbs with flaccidity with a power of 0/5 and diminished sensation at the level of C3. Neuro imaging was done. MRI brain with cervical screening revealed no edema, cord compression. MRI CERVICAL SPINE – NORMAL. Stressor: He was convicted under POSCO act for 3 years, 2 days before the incident. Neurosurgeon ruled out the physical cause of the above presentation. Detailed history revealed he was being convicted for 3 years for a marrying a 17 years old girl with her consent under POSCO act 2 days prior to the incident. He was seen distressed after hearing the verdict, had sleep disturbances, remained aloof, not communicating with others. He attempted suicide by jumping from the wall. He had a history of occasional cannabis use for the past 2 years. Family history revealing possession attacks in his mother. He was raised by a single parent as his father left him and his mother when he was 5 years old. He had no episodes of similar illness in the past. His temperament revealed that he had difficulty in adjustment to the situations being impulsive and had self-injurious behavior. Mental status examination revealed that the patient was lying in supine position, not able to move his all 4 limbs with obvious psychomotor retardation decreased talks, sad mood. DISCUSSION: The clinical picture is indicative of Dissociative Motor Disorder F44.4 according to ICD 10. After taking a detailed history, it was clear that he was extremely distressed regarding his punishment under POSCO act as he willfully married a 17 years old girl with her consent which could not stand in the court of law. Patient was started on therapy sessions as well as low-dose diazepam. In the sessions, possible causes of these symptoms were discussed, his family members were also psycho-educated about the psychosomatic nature of the symptoms and advised to encourage him for a symptom-free lifestyle. They were also given an instruction not to pay attention to his complaints of physical nature. Psychotherapy sessions were started in which all her stressors were therapy discussed. CONCLUSION: Conversion disorder, somatoform disorder, and malingering always remain a diagnostic challenge for the clinicians. The prompt history taking, identification of stressors, use of appropriate and validated physical examination manoeuvres, and coordination of care and information exchange between all family members and medical team may facilitate the expeditious care of these patients in a cost-effective manner. Psychogenic symptoms should be treated using suggestions, patience, and reassurance. Early recognition of a conversion disorder will limit unnecessary tests and medications. The quality of doctor-patient relationship can influence outcome. The existing literature supports a multidisciplinary treatment approach, with specific interventions, such as cognitive behaviour therapy for cognitive restructuring and psychodynamic therapy for addressing symptom connections to trauma and dissociation.",

      "abstract": "The decline in cognitive function is a core feature of dementias. However, other symptoms of the disease are also crucial. These symptoms are the behavioral and psychological manifestations of dementia and include symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, delusional misindentification syndromes (DMS), illusions, anxiety, aggression, depression, personality changes, disinhibition-impulsivity, violation of social and moral norms, changes in dietary or eating behavior and repetitive behaviors. Delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, depression and aggression are highly prevalent in Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, whereas symptoms that include severe disturbance of behavior are highly prevalent in frontotemporal dementias. Psychotic symptoms are associated with subcortical disturbances mainly of the limbic system. Patients with depression present greater loss of noradrenergic cells in the locus coeruleus and loss of serotonergic nuclei of dorsal raphe. Furthermore, disturbances of behavior are associated with frontal lobe dysfunction. Atypical antipsychotics is the first treatment option for delusions, hallucinations, misidentifications, anxiety and aggression. Furthermore, antidepressants may be useful for moderate or severe depression as well as for disinhibition-impulsivity, aggression, changes in dietary or eating behavior and repetitive behaviors. Cholinesterase inhibitors may also improve apathy, anxiety, disinhibition, aberrant behavior, mood disorders and hallucinations. Moreover, non-pharmacological methods alone or in combination with psychotropic drugs may also improve patient's symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (PNH) syndromes can be subclassified as primary and secondary. The main primary PNH syndromes are neuromyotonia, cramp-fasciculation syndrome (CFS), and Morvan’s syndrome, which cause widespread symptoms and signs without the association of an evident peripheral nerve disease. Their major symptoms are muscle twitching and stiffness, which differ only in severity between neuromyotonia and CFS. Cramps, pseudomyotonia, hyperhidrosis, and some other autonomic abnormalities, as well as mild positive sensory phenomena, can be seen in several patients. Symptoms reflecting the involvement of the central nervous system occur in Morvan’s syndrome. Secondary PNH syndromes are generally seen in patients with focal or diffuse diseases affecting the peripheral nervous system. The PNH-related symptoms and signs are generally found incidentally during clinical or electrodiagnostic examinations. The electrophysiological findings that are very useful in the diagnosis of PNH are myokymic and neuromyotonic discharges in needle electromyography along with some additional indicators of increased nerve fiber excitability. Based on clinicopathological and etiological associations, PNH syndromes can also be classified as immune mediated, genetic, and those caused by other miscellaneous factors. There has been an increasing awareness on the role of voltage-gated potassium channel complex autoimmunity in primary PNH pathogenesis. Then again, a long list of toxic compounds and genetic factors has also been implicated in development of PNH. The management of primary PNH syndromes comprises symptomatic treatment with anticonvulsant drugs, immune modulation if necessary, and treatment of possible associated dysimmune and/or malignant conditions.",

The article highlights the challenges in differential diagnosis and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach. Case Details: Male patient, 61 years old, with a history of parkinsonism, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. He began treatment with levodopa and showed slight motor improvement but continued to experience cognitive deficits. Over the course of follow-up, he developed asymmetric motor symptoms, apraxia, and sleep disturbances. Neuropsychiatric assessments suggested progressive deterioration, leading to the suspicion of CBS. Limited access to advanced neuroimaging within the public health system (SUS) hindered a definitive diagnosis. Final Considerations: The case underscores the need for an accurate diagnosis, with access to imaging exams, and for individualized treatment. The limited response to levodopa and rapid progression of symptoms differentiates CBS from other Parkinsonian syndromes, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to improve patient quality of life.",

First there is discussed the anatomicophysiologic basis of the ocular symptoms of cerebral origin, especially the anatomic structure of the optic nerve and the pathways transmitting the different stimuli to the pupil. The typical Argyll Robertson phenomenon, which occurs solely in tabes and is therefore an unequivocal sign of this disease, presents a combination of absence of reaction to light with miosis, increased convergence reaction and absence (or decrease) of the sensory and psychic dilatation reflex. Absence of the light reflex without the other aforementioned characteristics is met with not only in tabes but in other intracranial diseases. Absence of",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) relies on the clinical effects of dopamine deficiency, including bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, usually manifesting asymmetrically. Misdiagnosis is common, due to overlap of symptoms with other neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and only autopsy can definitively confirm the disease. Motor deficits generally appear when 50-60% of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra are already lost, limiting the effectiveness of potential neuroprotective therapies. Today, we consider PD to be not just a movement disorder, but rather a complex syndrome non-motor symptoms (NMS) including disorders of sleep-wake cycle regulation, cognitive impairment, disorders of mood and affect, autonomic dysfunction, sensory symptoms and pain. Symptomatic LRRK2 mutation carriers share non-motor features with individuals with sporadic PD, including hyposmia, constipation, impaired color discrimination, depression, and sleep disturbance. Following the assumption that the pre-symptomatic gene mutation carriers will eventually exhibit clinical symptoms, their neuroimaging results can be extended to the pre-symptomatic stage of PD. The long latent phase of PD, termed prodromal-PD, represents an opportunity for early recognition of incipient PD. Early recognition could allow initiation of possible neuroprotective therapies at a stage when therapies might be most effective. The number of markers with the sufficient level of evidence to be included in the MDS research criteria for prodromal PD have increased during the last ten years. Here, we review the approach to prodromal PD, with an emphasis on clinical and imaging markers and report results from our neuroimaging study, a retrospective evaluation of a cohort of 39 participants who underwent DAT-SPECT scan as part of their follow up. The study was carried out to see if it was possible to detect subclinical signs in the preclinical (neurodegenerative processes have commenced, but there are no evident symptoms or signs) and prodromal (symptoms and signs are present, but are yet insufficient to define disease) stages of PD.",

The defining features of Alzheimer's dementia are progressive deficits in memory and other aspects of cognition, typically including language, praxis, visual and spatial processing, and executive function at some point during the course of the illness. Noncognitive phenomena, including apathy and unawareness, are important contributors to the burden of disease. At the same time, elemental neurological function, and therefore the general neurological exam, is usually normal, although paratonia and/or myoclonus may be present. These deficits result in reduced ability to perform daily activities, and most Alzheimer's dementia patients will become totally dependent on others unless they die of other causes first. The clinical presentation of Alzheimer's dementia is the result of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss that follow a predictable distribution in the brain. The hippocampus, limbic cortex, and polymodal association cortex sustain the greatest damage. Dysfunction in these regions results in the characteristic clinical pattern of Alzheimer's dementia and assists in its clinical differentiation from other dementing illnesses, which follow different anatomical patterns of neuronal dysfunction.",

The development of the kidney, the major excretory organ after birth, consists of 3 stages: the pronephros, or cervical kidney; mesonephros, or thoracic kidney; and metanephros, or abdominal kidney, the definitive kidney. In humans, nephrogenesis and organogenesis occur from the 6th to the 36th weeks of gestational age. After 36 weeks, nephrogenesis is complete and each kidney has a full complement of nephrons. The extent of chemical-induced renal toxicity is related, in part, to the efficiency in which the particular compound is transported by renal tubules. Because renal tubular transport capacities vary with maturation, the degree of nephrotoxicity may also vary with maturation. The signs and symptoms of nephrotoxicity can appear acutely or insidiously. Unexplained acute renal failure, chronic mild proteinuria, or even hypertension can be a manifestation of nephrotoxic agents. Species differences occur, thus the need for studies in humans.",

      "abstract": "There seems to be a lack of understanding between practitioners and patients on the topic of insomnia. One adult out of four complains of insomnia; however only one insomniac out of four has ever complained about it to their practitioner during a visit made for another problem and only one out of twenty has come to discuss specifically the problem of his or her insomnia. Only a few patients with insomnia take a treatment for it. This gap between the patient's feeling and the practitioner's answer has to be better understood if we want to know why insomnia seems to be so prevalent and what impact it has on society. One aspect may be a question of definition. Insomnia may be considered an ordinary complaint (after one poor night) or as a chronic disease. Practitioners have poor knowledge about sleep disorders and may be embarrassed about coping with an impairment they never specifically learned to manage. The second aspect concerns the impact of insomnia on daytime alertness and performance. While patients usually complain of an impaired daytime functioning with a feeling of fatigue, sleepiness, and risk of mistakes, many studies of insomniacs do not reveal any increased sleepiness or decrease of performance (measured by objective tests) the day following a poor night. Practitioners may therefore find it difficult to understand the real impact of insomnia on daytime functioning. The third aspect is related to the large co-morbidity between insomnia and psychiatric diseases, especially depression and anxiety. It does make it harder for practitioners to define whether the sleep impairment suffered by their patient is the cause for other symptoms or the consequence of an underlying disease. Thus, it makes it all the more difficult for the practitioner to determine which treatment is the most appropriate. These aspects have to be clarified if one wants to estimate the real impact of insomnia on society. It could be useful to both practitioners and patients to have a better understanding on the relationship between poor sleep and daily lives.",

Gait disorders are classified into lowest-level, middle-level, and highest-level disorders. In lowest-level gait disorders, only one major afferent system (visual, proprioceptive, or vestibular) is affected and the disturbance is usually self-limited or compensated. Middle-level disorders include myelopathy from cervical spondylosis; spastic hemiparetic gait from unilateral impairment of the corticospinal tract; gaits associated with movement disorders; and dystonic, choreic, hemiballistic, and cerebellar ataxic gaits.

      "abstract": "Abstract Neuromuscular disorders in adults can present with a wide array of clinical features and vary from acute life-threatening complications such as respiratory failure to slow progressive weakness and comorbidity. Common to most of these disorders are symptoms of weakness and dyspnea. Many patients with occult neuromuscular disorders will be evaluated for underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease by primary care and subspecialty providers and can experience delays in diagnosis due to challenges in attaining early neurological testing and recognizing vague symptoms as potentially arising from the neuromuscular apparatus. Additionally, many adults who develop neuromuscular disorders have concomitant cardiac or pulmonary disease and the presence of dyspnea or limitations in mobility are often attributed to these without pursuing further workup. We outline a review of neuromuscular diseases in adults and an approach to evaluation.",

Their sleep problems vary according to dementia subtypes, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Multiple factors, such as neurobiologic mechanisms underlying sleep disturbances and dementia, primary sleep disorders, long-term care environments, and physical and mental health conditions are associated with sleep disturbances. In older adults with dementia, these disturbances negatively affect their health, quality of life and medical expenses. As a result, these adults may require placement in a long-term care institution, and their caregivers' health may be adversely affected. Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions may alleviate the symptoms associated with sleep disturbances. However, nonpharmacologic interventions, particularly when combined, have been shown to be more effective than pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of sleep disturbances in older adults with dementia.",

Segun el area danada, se alteraran diferentes funciones visuales, como el campo visual, percepcion del movimiento, control de la escena visual compleja, control de los movimientos corporales guiados por la vision, la atencion visual, el comportamiento influenciado por un entorno complejo y el reconocimiento de una imagen. La etiologia de la disfuncion es variada, pero esta intimamente ligado con la prematuridad. Los principales mecanismos que pueden provocar la disfuncion visual cerebral son el sindrome hemorragico-isquemico, lesiones neurologicas focales, traumatismos, hidrocefalia, infecciones, hipoglucemias neonatales, metabolopatias, malformaciones cerebrales, cromosomopatias y epilepsia. El diagnostico de esta entidad es dificil, y en muchos casos, de exclusion. Ademas de evaluar la agudeza visual, la campimetria, la sensibilidad al contraste, la motilidad ocular, la estereopsis y la morfologia del polo anterior y posterior del ojo, contamos con unos cuestionarios especialmente disenados para identificar la disfuncion visual cerebral. En nuestro estudio hemos estudiado una poblacion de nacidos pretermino a la edad de 5 anos y, tras una exploracion oftalmologica completa, hemos realizado el cuestionario a los cuidadores de los pacientes a fin de identificar una posible disfuncion visual cerebral y, a la vez, poder aconsejar ciertas medidas rehabilitadores a fin de mejorar la calidad de vida de estos pacientes.",

      "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly apparent that sleep plays an important role in the maintenance, disease prevention, repair and restoration of both mind and body. The sleep and wake cycles are controlled by the pacemaker activity of the superchiasmic nucleus in the hypothalamus but can be disrupted by diseases of the nervous system causing disordered sleep. A lack of sleep has been associated with an increase in all–cause mortality. Likewise, sleep disturbances and sleep disorders may disrupt neuronal pathways and have an impact on neurological diseases. Sleep deprivation studies in normal subjects demonstrate that a lack of sleep can cause attention and working memory impairment. Moreover, if untreated sleep disturbances and sleep disorders such as Obstructive Sleep Apnoe (OSA) can also lead to cognitive impairment. Poor sleep and sleep disorders may present a significant risk factor for the development of dementia. In this review, the underlying mechanisms and the role of sleep and sleep disorders in the development of neurocognitive disorders (dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)) and, how the presence of sleep disorders could direct the process of diagnosis and management of neurocognitive disorders will be discussed.",

Parkinson’s disease is one of the more common and is caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain with loss of dopamine terminals in the basal ganglia. It is regarded primarily as a disorder of the motor system with bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor as its main features. However, autonomic, cognitive, and sensory symptoms frequently occur as well.\n\nVisual disturbance is not considered to be one of the cardinal clinical symptoms of Parkinson’s disease even though blurred vision, photophobia, asthenopia (weakness or fatigue of the eyes, usually accompanied by headache and dimming of vision), or trouble reading are common, often significantly interfering with the patient’s quality of life.1,2 Visual problems have particular significance because of the Parkinson patient’s impaired mobility and the implications for driving safety. In most cases, however, gross eye examination appears normal. Nonetheless, several papers have been published describing ophthalmological abnormalities, including problems with visual function, ocular movements, and visual hallucinations, as well as complications of drug therapy or neurosurgical interventions. We will review these in this article.\n\nThe most common ocular complaints are the result of ocular surface irritation, including blepharitis and xerophthalmia (dry eyes). Blepharitis is often responsible for ocular pain;3 dry eyes can cause itching, burning, irritation, and blurred vision that may improve with blinking. Unfortunately, spontaneous blinking is impaired, leading to discomfort, particularly after periods of reading, watching TV, or computer use. Blepharitis can cause excessive tearing, but most studies show decreased lacrimal flow in Parkinson patients, reflecting autonomic dysfunction.2,4\n\nThe decreased blink rate, a classical manifestation of Parkinson’s disease,5 is likely to worsen any discomfort from dry eyes, …",

      "abstract": "There is growing interest in the diagnosis of cognitive impairment among children with epilepsy. It is well known that status of seizures control has to be carefully investigated because it can be sufficient \"per se\" to cause progressive mental deterioration conditions. Subclinical electroencephalographic discharges may have subtle effects on cognition, learning and sleep patterns, even in the absence of clinical or sub-clinical seizures. In this respect, electroencephalographic monitoring (long-term and nocturnal recording) and in particular an all night video-polysomnography (V-NPSG) record can be crucial to detect the presence of unrecognized seizures and/or an inter-ictal nocturnal EEG discharge increasing. Epileptic encephalopathies (EE) are a group of conditions in which the higher cognitive functions are deteriorate as a consequence of epileptic activity, which, in fact, consists of frequent seizures and/or florid and prolonged interictal paroxysmal discharges, focal or generalized. AEDs represent the first line in opposing the burden of both, the poor seizures control and the poor interictal discharges control, in the cognitive deterioration of EE affected children. Thus, to improve the long-term cognitive/behavioural prognosis in these refractory epileptic children, it should be taken into account both a good seizures control and a strict sleep control, choosing carefully antiepileptic drugs which are able to control not only seizures clinically recognizable but even the EEG discharges onset and its increasing and spreading during sleep. Here, we review the efficacy and safety of the newer AEDs that, to date, are used in the treatment of EE in infancy and childhood.

A few discrete presentations can be identified: Parkinsonism as a late manifestation of complex neurodevelopmental disorders, characterized by developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DE-EE), with multiple, refractory seizure types and severely abnormal EEG characteristics, with or without preceding hyperkinetic MD; Parkinsonism in the context of syndromic conditions with unspecific reduced seizure threshold in infancy and childhood; neurodegenerative conditions with brain iron accumulation, in which childhood DE-EE is followed by neurodegeneration; and finally, monogenic juvenile Parkinsonism, in which a subset of patients with intellectual disability or developmental delay (ID/DD) develop hypokinetic MD between 10 and 30 years of age, following unspecific, usually well-controlled, childhood epilepsy. This emerging group of genetic conditions leading to epilepsy or DE-EE in childhood followed by juvenile Parkinsonism highlights the need for careful long-term follow-up, especially in the context of ID/DD, in order to readily identify individuals at increased risk of later Parkinsonism.",

We examined 88 patients with unilateral onset of idiopathic PD who underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, including language, visuosptial abilities, abstraction and reasoning, attention and mental tracking, set shifting, and memory. Patients whose motor signs began on the left side of the body consistently performed more poorly on the battery of cognitive measures than did patients with right‐side onset. Significant differences were found on immediate and delayed verbal recall, word retrieval, semantic verbal fluency, visuospatial analysis, abstract reasoning, attention span, and mental tracking. These differences could not be attributed to differences in the overall severity of motor symptoms at the time of cognitive assessment, or the current pattern of motor asymmetry. This finding suggests that damage to right‐hemisphere dopamine systems plays a disproportionately greater role in PD‐related cognitive decline than a presumably comparable left‐hemisphere dopamine depletion.",

      "title": "Fatigue and sleep disturbance following traumatic brain injury: A role for light therapy?",
      "abstract": "Fatigue and sleep disturbances are common and disabling symptoms following traumatic brain injury (TBI). They occur chronically, and impact significantly on the ability of individuals with these injuries to return to pre-injury function, as well as overall quality of life. The aetiology of these symptoms appears to be complex and most likely multifactorial in nature, involving the primary effects of mechanical neuronal injury, but also secondary factors such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive disturbance (particularly in the domain of attention). In the context of unclear aetiology, current understandings of fatigue and sleep disturbances have primarily relied on patient self-report, particularly for fatigue which is inherently a subjective complaint, but also for sleep disturbances. Identification of suitable objective measures for fatigue and sleep or their associated symptoms may assist in further understanding these complaints. Related to the limited understanding of these complaints following TBI, is the lack of well established treatment regimens. In theory, an optimal treatment of fatigue and sleep disturbance following TBI would involve focus on the symptoms themselves as well as their associated factors, such as depression and impaired attention. Recent research in the field of sleep and chronobiology, particularly research investigating the therapeutic applications of light exposure, suggests that light therapy may offer an efficacious modality for treatment of fatigue, sleep disturbance and associated symptoms in the TBI population. \n\nThe aims of the current thesis were to: (1) assess the utility of objective assessment tools in order to aid further understanding of disturbances to sleep-wakefulness and sustained attention (i.e. psychomotor vigilance) performances following TBI; and (2) investigate in a randomised controlled trial, the efficacy of blue light therapy, in the treatment of fatigue and its related symptoms in patients with TBI. This was achieved across three separate studies. \n\nSpecifically, study one investigated the utility of actigraphy as an objective measure of sleep following TBI. The findings of the study revealed significant associations between actigraphic and self-reported (diary) estimates of nocturnal total sleep time (TST) and daily TST in patients with TBI and healthy age- and gender- matched controls. While stronger associations between diary and actigraphy were observed in the control group, the magnitude of these associations did not differ significantly between groups. The study thus provided preliminary support for use of actigraphy as an objective assessment of sleep duration in the TBI population. \n\nIn light of previous research that has demonstrated associations between vigilance/sustained attention and both fatigue and sleep disturbances in patients with TBI, study two compared psychomotor vigilance performance in patients with TBI and healthy age- and gender- matched controls using the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). The PVT was selected as a potentially useful objective measure in patients with TBI as it has been commonly used within the sleep science field and is well accepted for its sensitivity to sleep loss, circadian timing, and countermeasures for sleepiness. Consistent with past research, study two demonstrated that patients with TBI showed slower performances and increased attentional lapses relative to healthy controls. Distribution analyses additionally revealed that patients with TBI performed more slowly across the entire performance distribution, consistent with a generalised cognitive slowing. Depression, fatigue and daytime sleepiness were found to have varying impacts on aspects of psychomotor vigilance performance. Previous use of the PVT in TBI groups has been limited and the study highlighted the sensitivity of the PVT to sustained attention deficits in patients with TBI. \n\nTaken together, the findings of study one and two have implications for the ongoing assessment of sleep and performance deficits in patients with TBI, and have potential to provide greater understanding of fatigue and sleep complaints in this population. \n\nFinally, given the lack of efficacious treatments for fatigue and sleep disturbances following TBI, study three examined the efficacy of blue light therapy as a potential treatment of fatigue and its associated symptoms in patients with TBI. Blue light therapy was selected for use given prior research findings which have demonstrated its alerting, circadian phase shifting, and mood enhancing properties. In a sample of patients with TBI who had self-reported fatigue and sleep complaints, study three demonstrated the efficacy of daily, morning exposure (45 minutes) to blue light over a 4 week treatment period in alleviation of self-reported fatigue and daytime sleepiness. This is the first demonstration of efficacy for a non-pharmacological treatment of fatigue and daytime sleepiness in patients with TBI. These findings establish the basis for large-scale randomised controlled trials of light therapy for fatigue in TBI, and have important implications for enhancing rehabilitation participation and long-term quality of life following TBI.",

      "abstract": "The larynx plays a crucial role in respiration, phonation, and swallowing, with its motor and sensory functions controlled by both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Neurological voice disorders arise when various neurological diseases, such as sensory impairment, motor weakness, reflex abnormalities, or incoordination, affect the laryngeal function. Patients with neurological conditions often present with voice changes, swallowing difficulties, or respiratory issues, leading them to seek evaluation and treatment from otolaryngologists, sometimes resulting in neurological consultation. Laryngeal motor disorders can be caused by dysfunction in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, midbrain, or cerebellum. Neurological voice disorders are often subtle at first and may become more pronounced as the disease progresses, commonly accompanied by other speech disorders such as dysarthria or aphasia. Early diagnosis of symptoms and understanding the characteristics of neurological diseases is crucial for effective voice evaluation and therapy. This review summarizes the clinical features, voice characteristics, and treatments of diseases that cause neurological voice disorders, including essential tremor, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, myasthenia gravis, and multiple sclerosis. Understanding the specific voice characteristics and appropriate treatment options for each condition is essential for improving communication outcomes in these patients. Additionally, addressing coexisting swallowing disorders is important when treating neurological voice disorders.",

Since clinical and pathological features are similar, it is generally accepted that both represent a continuum of the same disorder. PDD together with DLB account for around one fifth of all cases of dementia in the elderly. Studies suggest that most patients with Parkinson's disease would eventually develop dementia if they lived long enough. The diagnosis of PDD in the presence of long-standing pronounced motor features rarely poses a diagnostic dilemma. However, the diagnosis of DLB may be more difficult. It relies on the revised consensus clinical criteria which require the presence of at least two of the following three syndromes: persistent visual hallucinations, fluctuating defects in cognitive and functional ability, and parkinsonism. An early referral to a specialist clinic may not only help to confirm the diagnosis, but also to co-ordinate the group of professionals working with the patient. Well lit rooms and the use of glasses and hearing aids can help to reduce hallucinations. Cholinesterase inhibitors used in Alzheimer's disease have a role in DLB and PDD. Trials show moderate improvements in cognitive function in patients treated with rivastigmine. The greatest impact, however, seems to be on the psychotic features of the disease. Patients with DLB are less likely to have a good motor response from L-dopa than patients with Parkinson's disease or PDD.",

Simply defined, it is intellectual disintegration. The manifestations of dementia vary considerably, reflecting the mental, social, and emotional resources of a person before his illness began. Unfortunately, it often strikes the individual at the height of his productivity. The first symptom of the condition may be a decrease in expected level of functioning, and thus the disease may be very closely tied to the patient's work or professional status. It is important to note that the symptoms that usher in the process of dementia differ little from those that occur in normal people who are exhausted, anxious, or under severe pressure. Thus, a frequent early complaint is that the patient is",

      "abstract": "Objective: To assess the neuropsychiatric features of patients with neurodegenerative diseases on Guam. Background A unique clinical syndrome of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism dementia complex (ALS/PDC) is seen in Guam but other neurodegenerative diseases are also present. Much of the focus has been on the cognitive aspects of these dementias, while it is now known that neuropsychiatric symptoms feature prominently in neurodegenerative disease. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) assesses psychopathology in dementia patients by evaluating 12 neuropsychiatric disturbances commonly encountered in patients with dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, night-time behavior disturbances, and appetite and eating abnormalities. Our aim was to compare the neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with PDC and those with non-PDC neurodegenerative disease. Design/Methods: We evaluated the neuropsychiatric symptoms of 28 consecutive patients with dementia on Guam using the NPI. We used Chi-square tests to compare NPI symptoms in patients with PDC vs. those with non-PDC neurodegenerative diseases. Results: Amongst the 28 patients with dementia and an NPI, 8 had PDC and 20 had another neurodegenerative disease: AD/vascular (8), AD (7), vascular dementia (1), dementia with Lewy bodies (2), and choreiform disorders (2). Comparing the NPI symptoms in patients with PDC vs. all other neurodegenerative disease combined revealed significant differences in incidence of depression (63% vs. 15%, respectively, p=0.02), appetite/eating abnormalities (62% vs. 15%, respectively, p=0.02), and night-time behavior disturbances (50% vs. 10%, respectively, p=0.04). Conclusions: Many neuropsychiatric symptoms were observed in PDC and in non-PDC neurodegenerative diseases on Guam. Depression, changes in eating habits and night-time behavior disturbances were significantly more common in PDC. These differences likely relate to the underlying anatomical alterations and pathophysiology in PDC. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are present in PDC and are distressful to patients and caregivers, further study is required. Disclosure: Dr. Tartaglia has nothing to disclose.

This is consistent with the proposal that sensory dysfunction could provoke distress and a discrepancy between the multi-sensory frame given by experience and the actual perception. Both vestibular stimuli and vestibular dysfunction can underlie unreal experiences. Vestibular afferents provide a frame of reference (linear and angular head acceleration) within which spatial information from other senses is interpreted. This paper reviews evidence that symptoms of depersonalization/derealization associated with vestibular dysfunction are a consequence of a sensory mismatch between disordered vestibular input and other sensory signals of orientation.",

Los signos clinicos que manifiesta son resultado de una perdida neuronal superior al 60% en el area cerebral mas afectada, la sustancia nigra pars compacta. Asimismo, la aparicion de demencia y los desordenes cognitivos en la EP conducen a una EP con demencia. A su vez, la Demencia con cuerpos de Lewy (DCL) es tambien una enfermedad neurodegenerativa considerada como una de las causas mas comunes de demencia con una sintomatologia de deterioro cognitivo similar a la observable en la demencia de tipo Alzheimer y con la aparicion de sintomas de parkinsonismo. Su aparicion es insidiosa y se caracteriza por presentar una progresion lenta, a diferencia de su forma rapida tambien conocida como Demencia con cuerpos de Lewy rapidamente progresiva (DCLrp), que aparece de forma subita y evoluciona vertiginosamente. En todas estas enfermedades se produce una degeneracion neural que no es debida unicamente a la acumulacion de proteinas alteradas, sino mas probablemente como consecuencia de multiples factores deletereos convergentes. La hipotesis de este trabajo es considerar que la identificacion de cambios moleculares analizados gracias a la aplicacion de metodos “-omicos” servira para obtener informacion sobre un trascriptoma/proteoma de riesgo en las anteriormente citadas enfermedades. El principal objetivo abordado en la presente tesis es la identificacion de las alteraciones moleculares presentes en diferentes regiones cerebrales y en los distintos estadiajes de Braak de la EP, asi como en la DCL y en la DCLrp, por medio del uso de muestras de cerebro humano post-mortem comparando con controles, combinando estudios de microarrays, mRNA, proteinas y ensayos enzimaticos. Los resultados obtenidos por medio de metodos de transcriptomica con su posterior validacion y ampliacion a proteomica han permitido identificar alteraciones moleculares de distintas vias metabolicas incluyendo cambios en la maquinaria de sintesis de proteinas, en el metabolismo mitocondrial y energetico, en la neuroinflamacion, en la via de las purinas y en nuevas vias de senalizacion comprendiendo las vias olfativas y gustativas.",

Neuroimaging features often are non-specific. Features like myoclonic jerks, cognitive decline and typical EEG findings lead to a strong suspicion of SSPE. Here, we describe the stagewise progression of a case of SSPE in a 14-year-old girl who had myoclonic jerks and cognitive decline at onset. During the course of disease, the patient developed cortical vision loss, atypical extrapyramidal features like segmental and hemifacial dystonia ultimately leading to a bedbound vegetative state.

      "abstract": "Abstract Apathy is a common condition that involves diminished initiative, diminished interest and diminished emotional expression or responsiveness. It is highly prevalent in the context of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and is related to poor health outcomes. Presence of apathy is associated with cognitive and functional decline in dementia. Despite its negative impact on health, there is no definitive treatment for apathy, a clinical reality that may be due in part to lack of knowledge about assessment, neuropsychological features and neurobiological underpinnings. Here, we review and synthesize evidence from clinical, epidemiological, neuropsychological, peripheral biomarker and neuroimaging research. Apathy is a common feature of depression and cognitive disorders and is associated with impairment in executive function. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies point to dysfunction of brain circuitry involving the prefrontal cortex, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex circuit, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex circuit, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex circuit. However, inconsistent findings, particularly in neuroimaging may be due to heterogeneity of apathy symptoms (with a need to better elucidate subtypes), neuropsychiatric comorbidities, the severity of cognitive impairment and other factors. These factors need to be accounted for in future studies so that biomarker research can make progress. On the whole, the literature on apathy has identified likely neurocognitive, peripheral biomarker and neuroimaging targets for understanding apathy, but also points to the need to address methodological issues that will better inform future studies. In turn, as we learn more about the underpinning of apathy and its subtypes, subsequent research can focus on new neurally based interventions that will strengthen the clinical management of apathy in the context of its comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "Summary Comorbidity commonly refers to the cooccurrence (o r dual diagnosis) of two disorders or syndromes in the same patient, regardless of whether the disorders are coincidentally or causally linked. Indeed, illnesses have been classified in discrete diagnostic categories although no sharp discontinuities in symptom distributions are observed across most mental disorders. Depression is a relatively common psychiatric comorbididy of most neurological disorders, with prevalence rates ranging between 20 and 50% among patients with stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and dementia. Furthermore, depression is an independent predictor of poor quality of life in these patients and has a negative impact on the response to treatment, course and recovery of neurological deficits. Comorbid depressive disorders in neurologic patients can be indistinguishable to the primary mood disorders and may mimic major depression, dysthymic, minor depressive, and bipolar disorders described in the DSMIV classification of mood disorders. In addition, the great overlap of medical and psychiatric symptoms in depression and neurologic disorders may lead to both falsepositiv e and falsenegative diagnoses of depression. Patient with comorbid condition have lower response rate and /or a longer time to response, greater reports of side effect early in treatment and greater likely hood of dropping out. In this review, we focus on comorbid disorder associated with depression.",

Patients with similar overall intellectual function scores had no distinct pattern of neuropsychological test performance. Depression, absent in patients with Alzheimer's disease, was present in half the patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's disease and was correlated with intellectual decline. The concept of subcortical dementia is misleading.

Clinical variantsFTLD is clinically defined according to the consensus criteria by Neary and colleagues (Neary, Snowden et al. 1998).The site of focal cerebral atrophy, i.e., frontal and/or temporal, left and/or right determines the clinical presentation.Behavioral variant FTLD (bvFTLD) is associated with usually a symmetrical frontal dysfunction.The language variants progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD) are subsumed under the clinical syndrome of primary progressive aphasia (Mesulam 2001) and show involvement of the left anterior temporal lobe. Behavioral variant FTLDBvFTLD is the most common subtype of FTLD.Patients with bvFTLD show progressive personality and behavioral changes.Deficits in executive function, social interpersonal conduct, loss of insight (anosognosia), emotional blunting, stereotyped verbal output, hyperorality, dietary changes with weight gain, mood changes including irritability, depression, fatuous euphoria, tactlessness, loss of concern for feeling for others, lack of empathy, reduced emotional engagement, utilisation behavior, obsessive behavior, and neglect of personal hygiene all encompass the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms in bvFTLD.BvFTLD can be subdivided into an (1) dorsolateral/medial type with an apathetic profile, and (2) basal type with pronounced behavioral changes (Snowden, Bathgate et al. 2001).Parkinsonian features like rigidity and bradykinesia can be associated with bvFTLD.In many FTLD patients with Parkinsonism, a genetic linkage to chromosome 17 (tau, PGRN) was found, and these cases were termed FTDP-17.Incontinence, orthostatic dysregulation, and the presence of frontal signs (saccadic eye movements, disturbed upward gaze, paratonia, inexhaustible blink reflex, abnormal Luria sequence) on neurological examination may be present.CT or MRI may be normal early in the course, but symmetrical atrophy frontal atrophy and involvement and atrophy of the prefrontal cortex, the paralimbic areas anterior cingulum and frontal insula, and thalamus (Grimmer, Diehl et al. 2004).At later stages, atrophy may be observed of the temporal and parietal cortex (Diehl-Schmid, Grimmer et al. 2007).[F18]-FDG-PET and HMPAO-SPECT are useful to establish the clinical diagnosis and show the typical involvement of the frontal and temporal lobes (Mendez, Shapira et al. 2007;Mosconi, Tsui et al. 2008).

Our cases, combined with a review of the literature, demonstrate that there is no correlation among severity of hypertension, parity, and location of lesions at initial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings or between the severity of hypertension and neurological symptoms. Two typical patterns are seen on MR images of patients with eclampsia. Lesions in the region of the posterior cerebral circulation are most common and are frequently associated with visual disturbances. Although there are lesions in the deep white matter or basal ganglia, a focal neurological deficit or alterations in mental status may not develop. This demonstrates the sensitivity of MR imaging in the detection of abnormalities in patients with eclampsia, even those without neurological deficits.",

      "abstract": "In this review we present a pragmatic approach to the patient with chronic vestibular symptoms. Even in the chronic patient a retrospective diagnosis should be attempted, in order to establish how the patient reached the current situation. Simple questions are likely to establish if the chronic dizzy symptoms started as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease or as a brainstem stroke. Then it is important to establish if the original symptoms are still present, in which case they need to be treated (e.g. repositioning maenouvres for BPPV, migraine prophylaxis) or if you are only dealing with chronic dizzy symptoms. In addition the doctor or physiotherapist needs to establish if the process of central vestibular compensation has been impeded due to additional clinical problems, e.g. visual problems (squints, cataract operation), proprioceptive deficit (neuropathy due to diabetes or alcohol), additional neurological or orthopaedic problems, lack of mobility or confidence, such as fear of falling or psychological disorders. A general neurological examination should also be conducted, amongst other reasons to make sure your patient's `chronic dizziness' is not due to a neurological gait disorder.

The disease can affect both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), but estimates of prevalence are complicated by heterogeneity in both the definition of the symptoms or syndromes considered and the paucity of high-quality prospective data. PNS presentations include diffuse sensorimotor neuropathy, small fibre neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, dorsal root ganglionitis, and trigeminal neuropathy or neuralgia. CNS presentations are similarly protean and include diffuse or focal presentations with neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms, as well as myelopathy and nonspecific white matter changes. The co-occurrence of Sjögren’s syndrome with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and multiple sclerosis–like presentations is an ongoing area of investigation. Where relevant, management strategies for PNS and CNS manifestations are briefly reviewed.",

      "title": "All children who experience epileptic falls do not necessarily have Lennox‐Gastaut syndrome… but many do",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Lennox‐Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe, chronic, epileptic encephalopathy, primarily with childhood onset, which is characterised by a triad of features: multiple seizure types, including tonic seizures that may appear late in the course of the disorder; abnormal EEG features with slow spike‐wave discharges; and cognitive impairment. Recognition of LGS is problematic, since the seizure types and EEG features that characterise it are not pathognomonic and often change over time. Furthermore, although seizures associated with LGS may occur de novo , the appearance of core LGS seizures may be preceded by prolonged periods of other seizure types, including myoclonic seizures, partial seizures, or infantile spasms. This has led some authors to postulate that a continuum between LGS and other types of childhood epilepsy may exist. Accurate diagnosis requires careful assessment of both clinical and EEG features, in order to distinguish LGS from other childhood epilepsy syndromes, such as atypical benign partial epilepsy of childhood, Dravet syndrome or epilepsies with predominantly myoclonic‐astatic seizures. Since there is no biological marker that can be used to confirm diagnosis of LGS and because of the multiple aetiologies that could lead to its development, early referral to a specialist team may prove to be crucial for facilitating both diagnosis and management. Such an approach ensures that patients receive the appropriate treatment at the correct time, providing the best opportunity for the clinical course and overall prognosis to be improved. Effective management of LGS requires regular reappraisal of the evolving symptoms and features, and adjustment of the treatment accordingly.",

This review concentrates on those IEMs for which specific treatment is available. The common metabolic causes of seizures vary according to the age at presentation.

Children with epileptic encephalopathy usually have a combination of early seizure onset, sometimes as early as in infancy with severe pathology, chronicity, and multiple seizure types, including but not limited to status events or frequent abnormal interictal patterns, requiring antiepileptic drugs polypharmacy, making these some of the most challenging epilepsy cases with poor cognitive and behavioral prognosis. We describe prognostic indicators for cognitive and behavioral comorbidity in childhood epilepsy. The main focus of the paper is to provide an overview of several epileptic encephalopathies by summarizing their clinical features, providing updates on recent advances in imaging and genetics, and discussing neurodevelopmental outcomes with respect to various treatment modalities, including epilepsy surgery.",

Neurons are highly specialized cells and are responsible for communicating information in both chemical and electrical forms. Unlike other cells, nerve cells normally do not divide and multiply; thus the body does not replace dead or damaged neurons. Neurodegenerative disorders result in progressive degeneration and/or death of nerve cells and can be defined as hereditary and sporadic conditions characterized by progressive nervous system dysfunction. Most of these disorders are associated with degeneration of the affected central or peripheral structures of the nervous system. Neurodegenerative disorders include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease), prion diseases, brain cancer, epilepsy, encephalitis, hydrocephalus, genetic brain disorders, and others. Most of them are incurable and burdensome conditions that cause complications with movement (ataxias), or mental functioning (dementias).",

The resultant visual disability can be profound even when visual acuities are unaffected, and can cause significant disability in the execution of daily activities. This can prompt consultation with an eye care specialist. Patients complain of poor vision, difficulty in identifying someone in a group, or finding an object on a patterned background or among other objects, but a thorough examination often does not reveal the clinical basis for these complaints. The diagnosis of attentional dysfunction is also easily missed because at present it can only be recognised on the basis of adequate history taking from both the patient and close relatives and friends.

Most studies of dementia deal with light to moderate stages of the condition, while relatively little attention has been paid to its most severe stages. This review presents a clinical description of patients with severe dementia and of the tests currently available to evaluate their cognitive, behavioural, and functional status. Available instruments such as the Hierarchic Dementia Scale or the Severe Impairment Battery now allow quantification of the cognitive and behavioural status of patients with severe dementia. Experience with severe dementia shows that, far from being in a `vegetative state', as is commonly thought, late‐stage patients are in fact quite different from one another and in most cases continue to have an interaction with their environment. This ability to better define the characteristics of patients with severe dementia provides the basis for correlations between clinical data and data derived from neuroimaging, neurochemistry, or neuropathology. It also sets the stage for possible therapeutic trials involving these patients.",

Thus, neonatal motor behaviour is unsuitable as a basis for an estimate of conceptional age in small-for-gestational-age infants of toxaemic mothers. In the infants in this study the abnormal motor behaviour was not due to symptomatic hypo-glycaemia, neonatal asphyxia, or any other overt postnatal illness. The maturation of the fetal nervous system was adversely affected by maternal toxaemia and intrauterine malnutrition. In the same infants of toxaemic mothers bioelectric brain maturation wad frequently retarded and/or abnormal. The consistently abnormal EEG phenomena could—if at all—only exceptionally be explained by perinatal hypoxia or postnatal hypoglycaemia and they occurred in the absence of any other overt postnatal illness. The results suggest that central nervous system maturation does not proceed independently of the nutritional status of the fetus.",

In addition to cognitive impairments, neuropsychiatric symptoms are observed in MS, the most common being alterations in mood state. Neurobehavioral deficits have multidimensional effects on the activities of daily living and quality of life. Consequently, attention should be paid to early diagnosis and treatment.

The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia include drooling, difficulty initiating swallowing, nasal regurgitation, difficulty managing secretions, choke/cough episodes while feeding, and food sticking in the throat. If unrecognized and untreated, neurogenic dysphagia can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, and respiratory complications. The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia may be relatively inapparent on account of both compensation for swallowing impairment and diminution of the laryngeal cough reflex due to a variety of factors. Patients with symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia should undergo videofluoroscopy of swallowing, which in the case of neurogenic dysphagia typically reveals impairment of oropharyngeal motor performance and/or laryngeal protection. The many causes of neurogenic dysphagia include stroke, head trauma, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease and myopathy. Evaluation of the cause of unexplained neurogenic dysphagia should include consultation by a neurologist, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, blood tests (routine studies plus muscle enzymes, thyroid screening, vitamin B12 and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies), electromyography/nerve conduction studies, and, in certain cases, muscle biopsy or cerebrospinal fluid examination. Treatment of neurogenic dysphagia involves treatment of the underlying neurologic disorder (if possible), swallowing therapy (if oral feeding is reasonably safe to attempt) and gastrostomy (if oral feeding is unsafe or inadequate).",

Recently, awareness of sleep disorders related to PD has increased, reflecting their significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient. However, sleep disturbances are still often under-recognized. In PD, multiple factors are associated with sleep disturbances; impaired arousal systems and sleep structure as disease-related changes, nocturnal motor symptoms, hallucinations and psychosis, pain, nocturia, depressive symptoms and dopaminergic medication can all cause insomnia. Further, these factors can coexist and influence each other during the course of the disease. In addition, sleep-related breathing disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS) and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) can also lead to impaired sleep. Some idiopathic RBD patients have been associated with a risk for developing neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. Therefore, early diagnosis of RBD may have significant clinical implications for neuroprotective strategies. Several studies have revealed an increased incidence of RLS in PD patients compared to the general population. The favorable responses to dopaminergic medications in treating both RLS and PD suggest shared pathophysiologies between the two diseases; however, neuroimaging studies of dopaminergic systems remain inconclusive. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of sleep disturbances in PD and the existing treatments.",

Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual.

Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life. Methods used, based on clinical kinesiology, and appropriate exercise and modification, kinesitherapy has positive effects in treating the condition of people with cerebral palsy",

The symptoms depend on the development level and age of the child. In the first years of life movement disorders and epileptic seizures occur, later additional disturbances of sensory functions, language and mental impairments. In the course most of the children develop severe insomnia, restlessness or neuroirritability, seizures, pain and spasticity or dystonia, which are very distressing for the patient, the parents and the environment. By the limits of communication we often cannot interpret many symptoms such as restlessness and screaming.",

It usually presents as brief, self-limited episodes of involuntary movements that can affect a part or the entire body and that are sometimes accompanied by loss of consciousness and sphincter control. Epilepsy may be considered after a single unprovoked seizure in a patient with a high risk of recurrence. Paroxysmal non-epileptic disorders are defined as episodes of sudden onset and short duration that imitate an epileptic seizure, caused by a brain dysfunction of diverse origin that, unlike epilepsy, is not due to excessive neuronal discharge. Its incidence is much higher than epilepsy and it can appear at any age. It is important for diagnosis to analyze the triggering factors, the details of each episode, physical examination and only proceed to basic complementary tests such as video-electroencephalogram in case of doubt or for diagnostic confirmation. There is a tendency to overdiagnose epilepsy and excessive use of anticonvulsant drugs. Those that can most frequently be confused are syncope, \"daydreams\" and pseudoseizures.",

According to the recent reports, 1 out of every 58 newly-born children is suffering from autism. The aetiology of the disorder is complex and poorly understood, hindering the adaptation of targeted and effective therapies. There are no well- established diagnostic biomarkers for autism. Hence the analysis of symptoms by the pediatricians plays a critical role in the early intervention.In the present report, we have emphasized 24 behavioral, psychological and clinical symptoms of autism.Impaired social interaction, restrictive and narrow interests, anxiety, depression; aggressive, repetitive, rigid and self-injurious behavior, lack of consistency, short attention span, fear, shyness and phobias, hypersensitivity and rapid mood alterations, high level of food and toy selectivity; inability to establish friendships or follow the instructions; fascination by round spinning objects and eating non-food materials are common psychological characteristics of autism. Speech or hearing impairments, poor cognitive function, gastrointestinal problems, weak immunity, disturbed sleep and circadian rhythms, weak motor neuromuscular interaction, lower level of serotonin and neurotransmitters, headache and body pain are common physiological symptoms.A variable qualitative and quantitative impact of this wide range of symptoms is perceived in each autistic individual, making him/her distinct, incomparable and exceptional. Selection and application of highly personalized medical and psychological therapies are therefore recommended for the management and treatment of autism.",

      "abstract": "We report two cases of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), comparing the clinical and laboratory features of these predominant neurological patients and reporting their different outcome. NMO - a severe demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system - primarily affects the spinal cord and optic nerves, resulting in longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and/or optic neuritis. Our patients had a late pSS diagnosis, due to the absence of sicca syndrome and specific Sjögren serology in the early stages of their diseases, when the neurological symptoms prevailed. Many NMO patients have an accompanying autoimmune disease, most commonly Sjögren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus or a related profile of non-organ-specific autoantibodies. Neurologic involvement occurs in approximately 20% of patients with pSS, usually preceding the diagnosis (in 75-80% of the cases) [1,2]. The frequency of both neurologic manifestations (revealing pSS) and negative autoimmune serology, especially in the event of CNS involvement, could explain why underlying pSS is misdiagnosed [3,4]. Screening for pSS should be systematically performed in cases of acute or chronic myelopathy and/or cranial nerve involvement, mainly because these patients have a severe outcome. The presence of the anti-aquaporin4 antibodies, besides anti-Ro and anti-La, in both reported cases, is intriguing and raises the question of whether we are facing two distinct diseases or the NMO is just complicating an unusually less expressive Sjögren's syndrome subtype.",

      "title": "“Neuropsychiatric manifestation of hyponatremia: a case report”",
      "abstract": "Introduction “Electrolyte abnormalities are commonly encountered in daily clinical practice, and their diagnosis relies on routine laboratory results. Electrolyte disturbances can affect the brain among many other organs and tissues and must be promptly recognized, as they can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications if neglected or not appropriately treated. Neurological manifestations reflect the severity of acute neuronal dysfunction and thus require urgent treatment. Acute and/or severe electrolyte imbalances can manifest with rapidly progressive neurological symptoms, seizures, and psychiatric manifestations. They are more frequently observed in patients with sodium disorders (especially hyponatremia), hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Objectives Were the psychiatric manifestations secondary to hyponatremia or epilepsy? Or is it a comorbidity? What are the risk factors? And what is the appropriate course of action for this type of patient?” Methods We present, through a clinical case, the situation of a 64-year-old patient who experienced status epilepticus secondary to hyponatremia, requiring hospitalization in the neurology department. Subsequently, she developed psychiatric manifestations with a marked change in behavior. She began experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depressive mood, headaches, somatic complaints, and social isolation. Her condition gradually worsened, necessitating hospitalization in the psychiatry department 3 years later. Results The patient was placed on Carbamazepine by her neurologist, and since then, she has not experienced epileptic seizures. Her follow-up electrolyte panel initially showed slight disturbances before normalizing. Psychiatric manifestations were concurrent with these somatic symptoms and worsened over time. During her psychiatric hospitalization three years later, after a thorough evaluation, she was prescribed Sertraline ans Risperidone in combination with Carbamazepine, resulting in a significant improvement in her condition. Conclusions In summary, this case illustrates the critical impact of electrolyte abnormalities on both neurological and psychiatric health, especially in older patients. Understanding risk factors associated with electrolyte imbalances is crucial for effective diagnosis and management, particularly in the elderly. This underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to address the potential serious consequences of electrolyte disturbances on overall patient well-being.

The syphilitic disturbance of the nervous system is a chronic progressive disease caused by the pale spirochaeta. The nervous system disturbance occurs basically in two ways: secondary one, because of brain shells, vessels, gummatous manifestations involving in the pathologic process; or primary one, when the causative agent affects directly the brain substance.

Any type of epileptic seizure can develop into SE. Status epilepticus can be classified as generalized convulsive, non-convulsive and simple partial. Generalized convulsive SE includes tonic clonic seizures with either a partial or a generalized onset. Generalized tonic clonic status is defined when consecutive seizures occur without recovery of consciousness between them. Generalized tonic clonic SE is a medical emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality if untreated. The most common etiology of SE is non-compliance to antiepileptic drugs. Other causes include alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular lesions, drug intoxication, central nervous system infections, neoplasms and acute metabolic derangements. The metabolic-biochemical complication of SE includes respiratory and metabolic acidosis, anoxia, hyperazotemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions. Prognosis of SE depends on the duration and etiology of SE. Vigorous treatment of SE is recommended. Effective medical treatment of SE includes Benzodiazepines, Phenytoin, Barbiturates and several other new antiepileptic drugs. In this presentation, we discuss the updated management of SE and propose a protocol for management of convulsive SE.",

A woman aged 55 and a man aged 52 had changes of character and infarctions in the frontal lobe. Vascular dementia is, contrary to what most criteria suggest, often a subcortical syndrome. The relationship between cerebrovascular pathology on CT and MRI scans and cognitive and behavioural disorders is often hard to establish. If the criteria for vascular dementia are applied blindly, other causes of the subcortical dementia syndrome can be missed. The present criteria offer almost no room for detecting the subtle cognitive and behavioural disorders of cerebrovascular pathology.

Patients and Methods: The study used a patients and methods approach. The study also comprised studies and papers that provided information on clinical aspects, as well as links and correlations between Parkinson’s disease and mental illnesses. Results: Symptoms of mental disorders are extremely prevalent in PD, but they are frequently undetected, undertreated, and overlooked if not evaluated precisely. Neuropsychiatric disorders of Parkinson’s disease divide into a number of major groups: anxiety and mood disorders, psychosis, behavioral modifications such as sexual disorders, impulse control disorders, dopaminergic medication abuse, and sleeping disorders. Conclusion: The majority of mental health conditions in PD are treatable, and failure to do so has a negative impact. Numerous investigations demonstrate that psychiatric symptoms influence the quality of life more than motor manifestations. Depression seems to be associated with deterioration in cognitive performance, tasks associated with everyday living, and motor performance and might have the greatest influence on the quality of life in PD. Psychosis is the leading cause of caretaker concern and a significant predictor of nursing residence relocation. The objective of therapy for mental illnesses in PD ought to include remission; inadequate treatment must be avoided.",

      "title": "The Effects of Neuromotor Immaturity in Adults and in Adolescents",
      "abstract": "The problems associated with neuromotor immaturity are not confined to the childhood years. A cluster of immature reflexes which persist into later life can predispose an individual to be more prone to stress. Postural reflexes develop with primitive reflexes persisting underneath. In order to understand how postural and vestibular problems can interfere with higher brain functions in relation to maths, this chapter examines some specific features of dyscalculia in detail. The reticular activating system controls the overall degree of cortical alertness and establishes the sleep/wake cycle. Vestibular disorders can also affect hearing and auditory processing. Because vision and hearing are implicated, perception — the cognitive interpretation of external sensory stimuli — can also be affected. Multiple factors converge in adolescents and adults with neuromotor immaturity to create elusive and diffuse symptomatology. During the initial phases of treatment, vestibular-proprioceptive function normalizes and oculomotor disturbances resolve.",

      "abstract": "Systemic infection is often revealed by or associated with brain dysfunction, which is characterized by alteration of consciousness, ranging from delirium to coma, seizure or focal neurological signs. Its pathophysiology involves an ischemic process, secondary to impairment of cerebral perfusion and its determinants and a neuroinflammatory process that includes endothelial activation, alteration of the blood–brain barrier and passage of neurotoxic mediators. Microcirculatory dysfunction is common to these two processes. This brain dysfunction is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and long-term cognitive disability. Its diagnosis relies essentially on neurological examination that can lead to specific investigations, including electrophysiological testing or neuroimaging. In practice, cerebrospinal fluid analysis is indisputably required when meningitis is suspected. Hepatic, uremic or respiratory encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, drug overdose, sedative or opioid withdrawal, alcohol withdrawal delirium or Wernicke's encephalopathy are the main differential diagnoses. Currently, treatment consists mainly of controlling sepsis. The effects of insulin therapy and steroids need to be assessed. Various drugs acting on sepsis-induced blood–brain barrier dysfunction, brain oxidative stress and inflammation have been tested in septic animals but not yet in patients.",

It is especially important to identify cognitive impairment at the early (pre-dementia) stages, when appropriate medical measures are implemented, the progression of cognitive decline can be slowed down or stopped. Near-moderate cognitive decline (NMCD) at elderly and senile ages may be a predictor for the development of clinically significant cognitive impairment up to dementia. In most Western works, NMCD is associated with subjective cognitive decline, but it would be more legitimate to distinguish a form (a stage) of mild cognitive decline among NMCDs. It is assumed that NMCD is not necessarily a precursor to more severe cognitive impairment – the former can be a manifestation of age-related changes, emotional-affective disorders, and neurological and somatic diseases, although their presence substantially increases the risk of moderate and severe cognitive impairment. The review provides current ideas about the initial forms of cognitive decline, as well as neuroimaging data in these patients. It considers the influence of emotional-affective and cardiovascular factors on the development of cognitive deficit.",

Muscle fatigue is the cardinal symptom of MG. Respiratory muscle weakness and breathing problems are manifestations of MG even in mild stages of the disease resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Also sleep related conditions are among the manifestations of MG which include sleep disordered breathing (SDB) [i.e. central (CSA) and obstructive (OSA) sleep apneas, hypoventilation or hypoxemic syndromes], reduced sleep efficiency and quality, increased number of nocturnal awakenings, excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced rapid eye movement sleep and altered sleep perception and dreaming. On the other hand, sleep abnormalities may result in lack of concentration, cognitive impairments and mood disturbances as depression and anxiety. Central and peripheral mechanisms have been suggested for the association between MG and central nervous system manifestations and sleep abnormalities. Neurologists and sleep medicine professionals should be aware of the associations between OSA/CSA, hypoventilation and other sleep related conditions with MG and consider systematic investigations including polysomnography and ventilatory support. This will reduce morbidity and mortality and improve quality of lives of patients with MG.",

      "abstract": "Profound and debilitating fatigue is the most common complaint reported among individuals with autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. Fatigue is multi-faceted and broadly defined, which makes understanding the cause of its manifestations especially difficult in conditions with diverse pathology including autoimmune diseases. In general, fatigue is defined by debilitating periods of exhaustion that interfere with normal activities. The severity and duration of fatigue episodes vary, but fatigue can cause difficulty for even simple tasks like climbing stairs or crossing the room. The exact mechanisms of fatigue are not well understood, perhaps due to its broad definition. Nevertheless, physiological processes known to play a role in fatigue include oxygen/nutrient supply, metabolism, mood, motivation, and sleepiness—all which are affected by inflammation. Additionally, an important contributing element to fatigue is the central nervous system—a region impacted either directly or indirectly in numerous autoimmune and related disorders. This review describes how inflammation and the central nervous system contribute to fatigue and suggests potential mechanisms involved in fatigue that are likely exhibited in autoimmune and related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Various studies have suggested that Alzeimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic process that begins well before clinical expression of dementia. Moreover, works showed that weak cognitive performances can precede by a few years the diagnosis of AD. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) describes a state of abnormal cognitive functioning that is insufficient to warrant a diagnosis of dementia. The concept of MCI nominates old persons afflicted with light cognitive disorders which could present certain signs of AD several years before this one is not diagnosed. MCI does not significantly impact basic daily activities and is not accompanied by declines in overall cognitive function. People with MCI are three to four times more likely to develop Alzheimer's than those without such impairment. Amnestic MCI (significantly affects memory) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease, while nonamnestic MCI may progress to other types of syndromes (such as frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia or dementia with Lewy bodies). But some people with MCI don't go on to develop any type of dementia. Some remain stable, while others even revert to normal.The conversion rate from MCI to AD is 12% per year. After a brief presentation of the concept of MCI, this communication will emphasize on different subjects like cognitive area. This deficits will be link with neuroimmaging that demonstrate atrophic hippocampal formations, atrophic enthorinal cortices, greater total brain atrophy, enlarge ventricles. We demonstrated deficits in : – memory: episodic memory, visuopsatial and spatial short terme memory -executive function: flexibility and planification -attention : focus attention, visual search, ability to desengaged attention and to use visual cue to produce an alerting effect. MCI is a concept based on criteria of Petersen. This criteria help us to know if MCI is a transition state between cognitive decline on normal aging and clinical presentation of dementia. More over, this cognitive deficits help us to make the link between cognitive area and activity of daily living. MCI is a new hope for our generation and the prevention of dementia.",

      "title": "Cognitive functions and social cognition in multiple sclerosis: An overview.",
      "abstract": "Cognitive decline has been widely reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) despite its clinical heterogeneity, at all stages and in all subtypes of the disease. Deficits are most commonly present in attention, processing speed, working memory, verbal fluency and executive function. However, MS patients also show decreased performance in tasks related to social cognition, i.e. mental operations thatdrive interpersonal skills such as social perception, empathy and theory of mind. Social cognitive deficits are an underestimated but important aspect of impairment in MS, reflecting how people process, store, and apply information in social interactions. Deficits in these domains have been associated with reduced social and psychological quality of life, even after controlling for severity and duration of the disease, age, and neurocognitive performance. Social cognition impairment is not entirely dependent on and parallel to general cognitive dysfunction, given that some patients experience disorganization of their social life before a significant or detectable cognitive impairment. The decrease in performance of social cognition tasks may reflect changes in brain activity and brain structure, either general or regional. Both subtle diffuse pathology and acute local lesions have at least partially independent effects on aspects of social cognition. The observed white matter damage contributes to a mechanism of disruption in the network of brain connections involved in social cognition. Undoubtedly, there is a wide variability in the relationship of social cognitionand neuroanatomical findings, not only due to the brain's complex connectivity, but also to the lack of a unique operative definition of these cognitive domains. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare study results, given the variability of clinical presentations in all stages of the disease.More research would contribute in understanding social cognition deficits better and in determining whether and what kind of training could be beneficial.",

This report presents neuropsychological test findings of 35 Cushing's syndrome patients before initiation of medical therapy, and documents the frequency, nature, and severity of deficits. Performances on the Michigan Neuropsychological Test Battery revealed equivocal or no signs of neuropsychological deficits in 13 patients. Ten other patients had few and mild deficits, eight had moderate and more frequent signs of impairment, and four had frequent and marked deficits in language and nonlanguage tests of higher (cognitive) and/or lower (sensory and/or motor) level cerebral functions. The findings thus indicate varying degrees of diffuse bilateral cerebral dysfunction in two thirds of this population. Impairment was more frequent and severe in non verbal visual-ideational and visual memory functions. This pattern of deficits is similar to that in patients with other types of diffuse bilateral neuropathological processes such as toxicity, anoxia, and infectious cerebral disorders.",

Initial estimates based on nigral neuropathological findings or striatal dopamine imaging suggested a 5- to 6-year preclinical period. However, more recent evidence of Lewy body pathology in other neuronal populations preceding nigral involvement suggests that the preclinical phase may be much longer. Epidemiologic studies of nonmotor manifestations, such as constipation, anxiety disorders, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and anemia, suggest that the preclinical period extends at least 20 years before the motor manifestations. Olfactory impairment and depression may also precede the onset of motor manifestations; however, the lag time may be shorter. Recognition of a nonmotor preclinical phase spanning 20 or more years should guide the search for predictive biomarkers and the identification of risk or protective factors for Parkinson disease.",

Therefore, spontaneous motor activity and experienced intensity of symptoms were measured in 21 depressed patients who showed daily variations of subjective symptoms. Patients felt significantly less active, awake, and more depressed in the morning compared to the evening. However, corresponding activity levels, which were measured by actigraphy, appeared significantly higher in the morning compared to the evening. Increased motor activity could represent the observable behavioral equivalent of self-experienced psychomotor retardation and depressed mood.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive disorders that follow brain damage are an important source of insight into the neural bases of human thought. Although cognitive neuroscience is sometimes equated with cognitive neuroimaging, the patient-based approach to cognitive neuroscience is responsible for most of what we now know about the brain systems underlying perception, attention, memory, language and higher-order forms of thought including consciousness. This volume brings together state-of-the-art reviews of the patient-based approach to these and other central issues in cognitive neuroscience, written by leading authorities. Part 1 covers the history, principles and methods of patient-based neuroscience: lesion method, imaging, computational modelling and anatomy. Part 2 covers perception, attention and neglect, disorders of perception and awareness, and misidentification syndromes. Part 3 covers language: aphasia, language disorders in children, specific language impairments, developmental dyslexia, acquired reading disorders and agraphia. Part 4 covers memory: amnesia and semantic memory impairments. Part 5 covers higher cognitive functions: frontal lobes, callosal disconnection (split brain), skilled movement disorders, acalculia, dementia, delirium and degenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.",

This feeling is accompanied by muscle relaxation and slowing of brain activity. Nevertheless, body movements are a feature of normal sleep and when those impair sleep quality and consequent daytime function they are defined as abnormal. The introduction of polysomnography during which muscle activity is monitored by electromyography and videotaping enabled sleep researches to precisely assess the characteristics of normal and abnormal movements, to determine their appearance is at specific sleep stages and to define their severity in regard to sleep quality and their impact on daytime function. Indeed, abnormal movements during sleep became an essential part of the symptomatology of a number of neurodegenerative disorders. Normal and abnormal movement disorder related to sleep onset, particular sleep stages and during awakening from sleep will be described in some detail. Common and rare forms of sleep related movement disorders in children and adults will be reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Optometric management of neurodegenerative diseases is essential since visual signs, such as double vision, visual acuity reduction, or oculomotricity dysfunctions, are usually present in these subjects over the course of the disease. The present paper can guide clinicians in better managing their patients with multiple sclerosis.Patients with multiple sclerosis present near vision symptoms that may be related to binocular anomalies, but these symptoms have not been investigated and related to specific signs. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the binocular vision in subjects with multiple sclerosis, and to analyse if the near visual signs and symptoms observed are compatible with those found in convergence insufficiency, as occurs in other neurodegenerative diseases.A total of 57 multiple sclerosis patients and 26 healthy controls were examined and classified as potentially compatible with convergence insufficiency according to the signs and symptoms. Clinical diagnosis of convergence insufficiency was established when subjects met the following criteria: NPC breakpoint more than 6 cm, PFV ≤ than 15Δ (base-out), and exophoria greater at near than at distance at least 4Δ. Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) was administered to assess the symptomatology considering a score ≥16 as positive.According to the CISS score, 54,4% of the multiple sclerosis subjects revised showed a suspect of convergence insufficiency, with a median score of 27 (IQR 9), whereas only one subject from control group (3.8%) showed this suspect. According to the diagnostic criteria based on signs, only 15.8% of multiple sclerosis patients had a real diagnosis of convergence insufficiency.Multiple sclerosis patients showed symptomatology compatible with convergence insufficiency, but this was not supported by the signs which showed a more esophoric tendency. The discrepancies between the signs and symptoms could be due to the questionnaire used including items that are also related to the cognitive function and other ocular abnormalities.",

      "title": "Circadian aspects in the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia",
      "abstract": "Summary Because the endogenous circadian pacemaker is a very strong determinant of alertness/sleep propensity across the 24 h period, its mistiming may contribute to symptoms of insomnia (e.g., difficulties initiating sleep and maintaining sleep) and to the development of insomnia disorder. Despite the separation of insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders in diagnostic nosology implying independent pathophysiology, there is considerable evidence of co‐morbidity and interaction between them. Sleep onset insomnia is associated with later timed circadian rhythms and can be treated with morning bright light to shift rhythms to an earlier timing. It is also possible that the causal link may go in both directions and that having a delayed circadian rhythm can result in enough experiences of delayed sleep onset to lead to some conditioned insomnia or insomnia disorder further exacerbating a delayed circadian rhythm. Early morning awakening insomnia is associated with an advanced circadian phase (early timing) and can be treated with evening bright light resulting in a delay of rhythms and an improved ability to sleep later in the morning and to obtain more sleep. There is some evidence suggesting that sleep maintenance insomnia is associated with a blunted amplitude of circadian rhythm that may be treated with increased regularity of sleep and light exposure timing. However, this is an insomnia phenotype that requires considerably more circadian research as well as further insomnia clinical research with the other insomnia phenotypes incorporating circadian timing measures and treatments.",

Morphologically it is characterized by severe neuronal depletion and gliosis in many brainstem nuclei, in particular the substantia nigra, associated with widespread globose neurofibrillary tangles and tau-positive glial inclusions that are usually immunoreactive for both three- and four-repeat tau isoforms. Postencephalitic parkinsonism shares histopathological features with other tauopathies as a multisystem degeneration with tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles that have biochemical and ultrastructure features similar to Alzheimer's disease while α-synuclein and TDP-43 pathologies are absent. Postencephalitic parkinsonism differs both clinically and morphologically from both idiopathic Parkinson's disease and other tau-related movement disorders.

For the differential diagnosis, history and other symptoms are important such as hemiplegia, signs of brain stem dysfunction, meningism or headache. Metabolic, endocrinologic, toxicologic or electrolytic causes of coma usually can be diagnosed by laboratory examinations. Anamnestic informations, body inspection, clinical neurological examination as well as laboratory and imaging findings have to be added and categorized by a multilevel composition to establish a conclusive diagnosis. Simultaneously therapeutic measures for suspected primary cerebral diseases must be initiated, for example a rapid antibiotic treatment in case of a possible bacterial meningitis.

Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is a leading presenting symptom of illness in the elderly. Elderly patients with altered mental status, including agitation, should be presumed to have delirium until proven otherwise. The clinical manifestations of delirium are highly variable. A mental status evaluation is crucial in the diagnosis of delirium. Medical evaluation and stabilization should occur in parallel. Life-threatening etiologies including hypoxia, hypoglycemia and hypotension require immediate intervention. The differential diagnosis of etiologies of delirium is extensive. Patients with delirium need thorough evaluations to determine the underlying causes of the delirium. Pharmacological agents should be considered when agitated patient has the potential to harm themselves or others, or is impeding medical evaluation and management. Unfortunately, the evidence to guide pharmacologic management of acute agitation in the elderly is limited. Current pharmacologic options include the typical and atypical antipsychotic agents and the benzodiazepines. These therapeutic options are reviewed in detail.",

      "abstract": "Generally, dementia is a long-lasting and gradual process. While the body often remains strong for a number of years, mental capacities as well as the accumulated competencies and memories of a lifetime gradually slip away. Late stage symptoms include an inability to recognize familiar objects, surroundings, or people, increasing physical frailty, difficulties in eating and swallowing, weight loss, incontinence, and gradual loss of speech and movement control. Reflexes become abnormal and muscles grow rigid. In the end stage, people with dementia lie in bed in a foetus-like position seemingly living as a vegetative organism, being totally dependent on the care of others. This chapter focuses on people with severe dementia, answering the question of what supportive care could contribute to the well-being of these people. It argues that people with severe dementia cannot entirely be denied a (rudimentary) form of selfhood or personhood. They definitively are not persons in the strict sense of moral agents who are self-conscious and rational and demonstrate a minimal moral sense, but at least they can be called persons in a weaker sense.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder, with resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability being major symptoms (1). Neuropathologically, it is characterised by the presence of abundant filamentous inclusions of α-synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in some brain cells, including dopaminergic nerve cells of the substantia nigra (2). PD is increasingly recognised as a multisystem disorder, with cognitive decline being one of its most common non-motor symptoms. Many patients with PD develop dementia more than 10 years after diagnosis (3). PD dementia (PDD) is clinically and neuropathologically similar to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is diagnosed when cognitive impairment precedes parkinsonian motor signs or begins within one year from their onset (4). In PDD, cognitive impairment develops in the setting of well-established PD. Besides PD and DLB, multiple system atrophy (MSA) is the third major synucleinopathy (5). It is characterised by the presence of abundant filamentous α-synuclein inclusions in brain cells, especially oligodendrocytes (Papp-Lantos bodies). We previously reported the electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of two types of α-synuclein filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with MSA (6). Each filament type is made of two different protofilaments. Here we report that the cryo-EM structures of α-synuclein filaments from the brains of individuals with PD, PDD and DLB are made of a single protofilament (Lewy fold) that is markedly different from the protofilaments of MSA. These findings establish the existence of distinct molecular conformers of assembled α-synuclein in neurodegenerative disease.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sleep medicine is an increasingly important specialty as the adverse health consequences of disturbed sleep are recognised by patients and physicians, and the current classification of sleep disorders, as recognised by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), is summarised. Two primary sleep disorders, narcolepsy with cataplexy and the disorders of arousal, a symptomatic cluster that includes sleepwalking, confusional arousal and sleep terrors, are reviewed in greater detail. Both disorders can be summarised as being caused by inappropriate switching between the states of vigilance, although they are very different in age of onset, severity and impact on health. In narcolepsy the boundary between sleep and wakefulness is uncontrolled but in the disorders of arousal the boundary between states of sleep is affected. These two disorders also have a genetic predisposition suggesting that advances in knowledge of the relevant mutations could eventually translate into better understanding of the possible mechanisms and hence lead to improved treatments. Key Concepts: The disorders of sleep are primary, for example as a result of pathology in the mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness, or secondary, for example resulting from a medical condition. Apnoea, interruptions of breathing lasting longer than 10 s that result in arousal from sleep, is the principal presenting condition at sleep clinics. Polysomnography is used to record physiological parameters such as respiration rate, heart rate and blood oxygen level simultaneously with data allowing the stage of sleep or wakefulness to be defined. Basic research into the neurophysiology, molecular genetics and neurochemistry of sleep and wakefulness has been critical for understanding the causes of many sleep disorders. The classification of sleep disorders is continuously evolving and being refined as new disorders are recognised in the clinic and neurophysiological and neurochemical pathologies are better understood.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Mortality and neurological and mental outcome were studied in infants 28 days to 1 year of age with afebrile seizures not due to an acute postnatal injury. Cases were divided into four eizure types: infantile spasms; status epilep‐ticus; and “others” (patients without spasms or status), generalized and partial. Mortality was studied in 334 cases, mental and neurological prognosis in 313 infants followed 1 year or more. Globally the prognosis was very poor even outside cases of infantile spasms. Mortality was higher and mental and neurological sequelae were more common in symptomatic than in cryptogenic cases. The highest mortality and greatest number of neurological defects were in status epilepticus and in “others” partial groups. Severely retarded subjects were more common in infantile spasms and “others” partial. The proportion of mentally normal patients, however, was no different according to ictal type. Mental and neurological prognosis was less unfavorable when the first seizure occurred at or over 6 months. A family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions (21% of the cases in the whole series) was more common in the “others” subgroups, especially in the cryptogenic “others” (429c). The less unfavorable outcome obtained in cryptogenic “others” generalized with a positive family history. RÉSUMÉ On a étudiea la mortalité et le pronostic neurologique et intellectuel des enfants ayant eu entre L'âge été 28 jours et celui d'un an plusieurs crises épileptiques sans fiàevre, non liées a une atteinte cérébrale aiguë. Les sujets, suivant les types été crise, ont été divisés en quatre groupes: spasmes infantiles; états été mal épileptiques; “autres” (sujets n'ayant eu ni spasmes ni état été mal), généralisés et partiels. La mortalité a étéétudiée dans 334 cas, le pronostic neurologique et intellectuel chez 313 enfants suivis un an ou plus. Dans L'ensemble, le pronostic est tràes sëvëre, même quand il ne s'agit pas été spasmes infantiles. La mortalitéétait plus élevée et la fréquence des séquelles mentales et neurologiques plus grande dans les cas symptomatiques que dans les cas cryptogénétiques. La plus forte mortalité et le plus grand nombre été séquelles neurologiques ont été trouves dans les etats été mal et les “autres” partiels.

Quand la premiere crise avait eu lieu a 6 mois ou plus, le pronostic mental et neurologique etait moins mauvais. Une histoire familiale d'epilepsie ou été convulsions febriles (21% des cas dans L'ensemble été la serie) etait plus souvent retrouvee dans les sous groupes “autres,” surtout dans les “autres” cryptogenetiques (42%).

RESUMEN Se ha estudiado la mortalidad y la evolución été los estados neurológico y mental en niños été 28 dias a un ano été edad con convulsiones afebriles no debidas a insulto postnatal. Los casos fueron divididos en 4 tipos été ataques: espasmos infantiles, estatus epilepticus, y “otros” generalizados o parciales (enfermos sin espasmos o status). Durante más été un ano se estudié la mortalidad en 334 casos y el pronéstico mental y neurologico en 313 ninos. El pronostico global fué muy pobre incluso en los casos sin espasmos infantiles. La mortalidad fue más alta y las secuelas neurológicas m^s comunes en los casos sintomaticos que en los criptogenicos. La más alta mortalidad y el mayor niimero été defectos neurolbgicos se encontraron en los status epilepticus y en el grupo été“otros” ataques parciales. Los retrasos mentales severos fueron más frecuentes en los espasmos infantiles y en los “otros” ataques parciales pero la proporción été enfermos mentales normales no fue influenciada por el tipo été ataques. El pronéstico mental y neurológico fue menos sombrio cuando el primer ataque ocurri6 a partir été los 6 meses été edad. La historia familiar été epilepsia o été ataques febriles (21% en las series tota‐les) fué m&amp;s comun en el subgrupo été“otros” ataques y especialmente en los criptogenicos (42%). La evolu‐ción menos sombria se observo en el grupo criptogenico été“otros” ataques generalizados con historia familiar positiva. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Mortalität, neurologische Folgen und geistige Entwicklung wurden bei Kindern untersucht, die vom 28. Lebenstag bis zum Ende des ersten Jahres afebrile Krämpfe hatten, die nicht Folge einer akuten postna‐talen Schädigung waren. 4 Anfallsmanifestationen wurden unterschieden: “Infantile Spasms,” Status Epilepticus, “andere” (außer den vorgenannten) mit generalisierten bzw. partialen Anfällen. Die Mortalitat wurde bei 334 Patienten untersucht, die geistige und neurologische Prognose bei 313 Kindern ein oder mehrere Jahre verfolgt. Global war die Prognose sehr schlecht sogar wenn man Fälle mit Infantile Spasms unberiicksichtigt läßt. Die Mortalitat war höher, geistige und neurologische Residuen traten häufiger bei symptomatischen als bei kryptogenen Fällen auf. Die höchste Mortalität und die größte Zahl neuro‐logischer Defekte fand man beim Status Epilepticus und bei “anderen” Gruppen mit Partialanfallen. Schwer retardierte Patienten waren häufiger in der Gruppe der jenigen zu finden, die Infantile Spasms und “andere” Partialanfälle boten; aber der Prozent‐satz der geistig altersgemäßen Patienten differierte nicht in Abhängigkeit vom Anfallstyp. Die geistige und neurologische Prognose war ungünstiger, wenn die ersten Anfälle mit oder nach 6 Monaten auftraten. Eine positive familiare Belastung mit épilepsie oder Fieberkrampfen (21% der Fälle der gesamten Serie) fand sich häufiger in den Untergruppen mit “anderen” Anfällen, besonders bei den Patienten mit “anderen” kryptogenen Anfällen (42%). Am besten schnitten von den “anderen” kryptogenen Patienten die mit generalisierten Anfallen und einer positiven Familien‐anamnese ab.",

      "abstract": "L'enuresi primitiva (essenziale notturna) può essere definita come una minzione involontaria che avviene di notte durante il sonno, mentre nel corso della giornata la minzione è normalmente controllata, ed ha perciò caratteri peculiari. Il notare, a volte, nei bambini affetti da enuresi primitiva la concomitanza di piccoli disturbi psichici o emozionali, di piccolo male, di stati di ipervagotonia o spasmofilia, conferma la natura funzionale complessa dell'affezione, sulla quale influiscono in prevalenza turbe della vita psichica o degli interessi affettivi del bambino. Alcuni dei fattori psichici implicati nell'enuresi (mancinismo, infantilismo nei giochi o discorsi, terrori notturni, fobie) possono anche essere considerati come indice di una incompleta maturazione psichica. Non vogliamo qui discutere sull'etiopatogenesi della malattia, che è tuttora piuttosto oscura. La maggioranza degli autori considera l'enuresi primitiva come un disturbo funzionale complesso, non legato ad alterazioni dell'innervazione o della maturazione delle strutture nervose e muscolari preposte alla funzione vescicale, ma piuttosto riportabile ad alterazioni (o ritardo) del meccanismo volontario della minzione. Si parla di enuresi primitiva quando il controllo anche notturno della minzione non è stato raggiunto entro i primi tre anni di vita. Secondo Harrison (1967), a 5 anni l'enuresi è presente nel 15% dei maschi e nel 10% delle femmine, a 9 anni nel 5%. Il disturbo cessa spontaneamente alla pubertà in quasi tutti i casi.",

Diagnosis requires video-polysomnography evaluating the mentalis and flexor digitorum superficialis muscle activity plus audiovisual analysis of the manifestations occurring in REM sleep. Accurate diagnosis is important as the idiopathic form of RBD (IRBD) represents an early manifestation of the synucleinopathies Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy and because other conditions (e.g., severe obstructive sleep apnea) may present with nightmares and abnormal sleep behaviors. Patients with IRBD are candidates to receive neuroprotective therapy to stop the ongoing neurodegenerative process and develop parkinsonism and dementia. Clonazepam and melatonin improve the RBD symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "We report an unusual and dramatic type of visual illusion, a 90-degree forward rotation of vision on the sagittal plain in 2 cases of acute paramedian pontine infarction. At initial neurological examination, they were both alert and well-oriented. The one case had slight right lateral gaze palsy, left motor paresis and hallucinose pédunculaire, and the other case had slight right gaze palsy, right Horner's syndrome, slight left sensory deficit and left limb ataxia. They complained that they felt as if they themselves, the bed, the floor and the ceiling were standing vertically, although actually they were lying on the bed horizontally. The sensation of the 90-degree rotation of vision frequently occurred as soon as they awoke or opened their eyes, and continued for a few minutes. The illusion disappeared within several days after the onset of the pontiue infarction. These visual symptoms may be contributed to imbalance of the integrated processing among the vestibular, visual and somatosensory systems resulting from the brainstem lesion involving the vestibulo-cortical network fibers, or may be considered as dysfunction of the ascending reticular activating system similar to the mechanism of hallucinose pédunculaire.",

      "abstract": "The two physiologic components of conscious behaviour, namely arousal (vigilance) and content of consciousness (presence of mind), may be affected differently, depending on the type and distribution of the underlying brain disease. Disturbance of arousal primarily affects wakefulness and awareness and leads to obtundation, stupor and coma. States of reduced arousal are caused by bilateral lesions of the so-called ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), which is situated in the upper brainstem and the paramedian diencephalon. If, on the other hand, cognitive and mnemic function are degraded, the contents of consciousness are disordered; depending on the extent of the disturbance, confusion, lethargy and, finally, a vegetative state ensues. The chronic vegetative state (coma vigil) describes a condition of total mental loss with preserved vegetative functions and arousal. Degraded cognitive and mnenic functions results from either toxic-metabolic or extensive structural disorders of the cerebral cortex, where the limbic and mesial frontal areas play a dominant role for conscious behaviour. If the function of extensive areas of both hemispheres is suddenly depressed, temporarily reduced arousal also results. In order to differentiate between toxic-metabolic and structural brain diseases, the motor reactions, the ocular and the pupillary reflexes must be examined apart from responsiveness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Antenatal destructive events affecting the central nervous system of the foetus lead to disruptive brain lesions that are often associated with impaired neurodevelopment. The pathogenesis of these lesions encompasses a range of causes, including haemorrhagic, embolic, or other vascular events; exposure to teratogens, such as drugs or substance abuse; congenital brain infections; genetic conditions; and metabolic disorders. Cranial ultrasonography is the first‐line imaging modality to diagnose these antepartum brain lesions in the newborn infant; it is often complemented by brain magnetic resonance imaging to detect associated neuronal dysmigration and dysplasia. Using a pictorial approach, a differential diagnosis of foetal disruptive brain lesions and common findings related to antenatal brain damage can be made, including antenatal haemorrhagic and ischaemic brain injuries, porencephaly, schizencephaly, multicystic encephalomalacia, and hydranencephaly, as well as germinolytic cysts and lenticulostriate vasculopathy. The main conditions associated with foetal brain disruption, such as genetic cerebral vascular diseases, monochorionic twin pregnancies, congenital heart disease, maternal drug use, congenital infections, and inborn errors of metabolism can be used to illustrate typical imaging patterns that, when combined with clinical presentation, can assist in identifying the underlying mechanisms and causes, thus supporting individualized patient management.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is a common epidemiological mental disorder that includes Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), panic disorders (PD), and phobias; its causes include anxiogenic genes and the living environment; insufficient or low sleep quality can trigger and intensify anxiety disorders. Neurotransmitters play an essential role in operating our bodys crucial functions, such as emotional regulation and sleep, so much neuroimaging evidence suggests they are critical to forming anxiety and insomnia. Previous longitudinal studies suggest that insomnia is a significant index and predictor of mental health and, therefore, can also be generated from mental disorders due to their comorbidity. This short review will posit the formation of insomnia caused by the presence of anxiety disorders in patients with both insomnia and anxiety symptoms. This review further discusses some therapies that enhance and improve sleep quality among insomnia problems. It mostly debates the thesis that anxiety is the driving factor and precedes insomnia and its related neuropathological developments that can be highlighted from neurotransmitter systems and sleeping models such as the hyperarousal model. Overall, it is significant that individuals with anxiety-related disorders have lower sleeping qualities that cause functional impairment and lower subjective living qualities.",

      "abstract": "Medications with cognitive effects and/or side effects also affect sleep and dreaming. The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "abstract": "The history is presented of an emotionally rigid, sensitive, and dependent person with considerable repressed aggression, who experienced recurrent episodes of confusion, dyskinetic movement and uninhibited emotional behavior. Initially diagnosed as hysterical fugue states, further observation and study determined that these phenomena were associated with hypoglycemia due to a benignislet cell adenoma of the pancreas. Following removal of the adenoma, these episodes were eliminated, although the essential nature of his personality structure remained unchanged. Attention is drawn to the fact that diagnostic error occurs frequently in the study of the neurotic person; that the principal sources of error lie in methods directed toward exclusion of positive data related to physical disease or psychosis. The need for the establishment of positive evidences of neurotic personality structure is emphasized. The relationship between the basic physiologic dysfunction (decreased cerebral metabolism) and the resultant intellectual, motor and emotional behavior is discussed. It is suggested that inhibition and repression may be the physiologic and psychologic expressions of a basic phenomenon. With loss or impairment of either, as in this patient, and possibly in all delirious patients, there is evidenced release of concrete intellectual activity, less integrated neurologic behavior and less repressed emotional expression. A further consideration was the relationship of this patient's behavior in particular to the problem of delirium in general. As in all deliria, the primary psychologic disturbance lay in the level of awareness. This disturbance of consciousness, together with the varied neurologic symptomatology, is of a more or less impersonal nature. The emotional behavior dependent for its expression on the degree of disturbance of consciousness is more individualized and specific, not to the noxious stimulus, but to the personality structure of the delirious patient.",

      "abstract": "Emotions of any kind and experienced at any age are etiologic factors of neuroses only in predisposed persons. Predisposed persons are those of neuropathic and psychoneuropathic constitution. This is characterized by excessive excitability and abnormal reactivity of the nervous system. This involves, in various degree and proportion, the autonomic nervous system as well as the higher cerebral functions including associative and emotional mental reactions. Objective signs of autonomic nervous imbalance can be detected by physical examination. In the mental sphere, psychoneurotic constitution can be recognized by emotional imbalance, excessive, inadequate, untimely reactions (\"psychic dysmetry\").Neuropathic and psychoneuropathic constitution per se is compatible with perfect health. It deserves attention, however, in that its carriers may play an important role in cultural and social life and so exert a great suggestive influence on the mass of people. The type of neurosis or psychoneurosis and the symptoms of it depend chiefly on the constitutional morbid predisposition (constitutional biologic inferiority) of certain organs or organ systems and on the kind of emotional situations which the patient is unable to cope with. The great number of neuroses, psychoneuroses and psychosomatic diseases among patients consulting them makes it imperative that internists and general practitioners be capable of making the correct diagnosis and of carrying out the indicated treatments by \"minor psychotherapy.\"",

      "abstract": "The formulation of a diagnosis in a child who has neurologic impairment should not (except in extreme circumstances) be made on the basis of a single finding. For example, the presence of delayed milestones, primitive or exaggerated reflexes, abnormal muscle tone, abnormal posture, abnormal neurologic examination, and temporal course should all be used to make the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Furthermore, because each condition has a spectrum of disabilities from mild to severe involvement, determination of the child's abilities and impairments should be part of the diagnostic process. Because the child lives in a number of different environments, assessment of the child's functional abilities and evaluation of the environments should be made. Finally, evaluations by specialists in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychology, special education, and nutrition may be necessary to complete the child's diagnosis. The ability to examine the child over a period of time (i.e., continuity of care) allows the practitioner to provide a more accurate prognosis for future development. It also enables easier diagnosis of the child when he or she is acutely ill. This also allows a more trusting relationship to develop with the parent and enhances the ability to influence the psychosocial conditions that affect outcomes. Finally, all these children should have care coordination (case management) (i.e., someone who can ensure that they receive the care they need, without duplication) across all settings, including home, school, hospitals, and ambulatory facilities.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: A case study of a 12-year-old boy with Irlen syndrome illustrates the overlapping symptoms of Irlen syndrome and vestibular-related dizziness. Summary of Key Points: Individuals with Irlen syndrome have eyestrain and headache, and often report visual perceptual distortions of blurring, doubling, and movement of print on the page. These symptoms can be relieved with the use of individually prescribed tinted lenses or overlays. Visually induced dizziness, also known as visual vertigo, is characterized by dizziness and/or unsteadiness that is triggered by complex, distorted, large field/moving visual stimuli. Visually induced dizziness can be effectively treated with progressive, controlled exposure to optokinetic visual stimuli. The child with Irlen syndrome had impaired balance, impaired gaze stability, and symptoms of visual vertigo. His complaint of visually induced dizziness resolved following vestibular rehabilitation. Conclusions and Recommendations for Clinical Practice: When an individual with Irlen syndrome complains of dizziness, ruling out a concomitant diagnosis of a central and/or peripheral vestibular disorder is warranted. What This Adds to the Evidence: The visual symptoms associated with Irlen syndrome can overlap with those of visually induced dizziness. This case report is the first to describe overlapping visual and vestibular complaints of dizziness in an individual with Irlen syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in the prodromal stage of dementia and can precede the onset of cognitive impairment. The presence of NPS in cognitively normal patients or in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is associated with an increased risk of progression along the neurodegenerative process. The need to identify, in the early stages of the disease, the population at risk of cognitive decline has led to the formulation of the concept of Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI). This neurobehavioral syndrome is characterized by late-onset sustained psychiatric symptoms, in patients without cognitive deficits or in those with MCI, identifying a condition associated with an increased probability of conversion into dementia. MBI represents the neurobehavioral axis of pre-dementia risk states, as a complement to the neurocognitive axis of MCI. For some, MBI may be the initial manifestation of neurodegenerative disease, observed before cognitive impairment is apparent. The Mild Behavioral Impairment-Checklist (MBI-C) was developed on the basis of the MBI diagnostic criteria, established by the International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART). The MBI-C allows to identify, in a standardized way, patients with MBI and to follow the course of their neurodegenerative disease. This article describes the creation of the MBI-C scale and presents its Italian version.",

We must distinguish between this disease of the nervous system, which is one form of periodical insanity, and the physiological state in which the individual merely chances to indulge in liquor to excess. The great question of importance is to distinguish the two states or conditions when the result—intemperance—is the same. We must observe whether there are symptoms in our patient which can be referred to primary disease of the nervous system. We must examine for hereditary influences, which, when present, lead us, of course, to suspect disease.

Lower abdominal and leg pain were troublesome early symptoms. At about 12 months of illness, he developed tremor and unsteadiness, leading to progressive walking problems. Increasing social withdrawal and behavioural problems were complicated by the development of progressive memory and general cognitive impairment. Visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions occurred in the later parts of his illness. During the course of his illness, he developed the following neurological signs: cognitive impairment, limb and gait cerebellar ataxia, mild dysarthria and mild pyramidal signs. Extensive neurological investigations revealed no cause other than prion disease, including consideration of a wide variety of inflammatory, neoplastic, immunological and neurodegenerative illnesses.

Early recognition of neurologic dysfunction may provide opportunities for intervention and reduced morbidity. Recent Findings: Advances in the understanding of neurologic complications of renal disease and its treatments have led to more widespread recognition and earlier identification of encephalopathy syndromes such as cefepime neurotoxicity and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), dramatic reductions in the incidence of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome and dialysis dementia, and improved survival in disorders such as von Hippel-Lindau disease and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

However, this research is aimed at exploring the range of non-motor symptoms with an emphasis upon their ability to affect the patients with PD and their quality of life. With a slow onset of the known symptoms like tremor or rhythmic shaking of limbs called “pill-rolling tremor”, slowed movement (bradykinesia), muscle rigidity, stooped and altered posture, loss of the ability to blink or smile, and various speech and writing changes; the disease takes a leap into the non-motor symptoms like dementia, drooling, swallowing issues, difficulty urinating, and constipation. The dopaminergic pathophysiology of PD explains the anxiety, slowness of thought, fatigue, and dysphoria. Knowing the non-motor symptoms is crucial to help the clinician to make early diagnosis and to better understand the prognosis of the spectrum of this disease.",

      "title": "The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event The Diagnosis and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Disorders Leon C. Lack1* 1 Flinders University, Australia Sleepiness is determined biologically by two comparable but independent factors: homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm sleep drive. The circadian sleepiness varies with a host of synchronised endogenous physiological and hormonal rhythms across the 24-hour period. Normal entrainment of this circadian system favours sleep at night (aprox. 2300-0700h) and alertness/productivity during the day. However, abnormalities of the circadian system in timing or amplitude can cause chronic or short term difficulties sleeping when desired and being alert when necessary. Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) results from a 2-6 hour delay from normal of the circadian system making it impossible to initiate sleep before 0100h. Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) results from an abnormally early timed circadian system making it impossible to maintain sleep past 0300h. Free-running rhythms do not remain stable in the 24-hour period but tend to drift later making night-time sleep and daytime alertness difficult for periods of days or weeks. Jet-lag and shiftwork usually produce short-lived sleep/wake problems. Since the most common disorders are from abnormal timing of the circadian system, tools to re-time circadian rhythms such as retinal light stimulation and exogenous melatonin administration can be used to treat these disorders. Light intensity, duration, and wavelength are important dimensions for treatment effect. However, the timing of light is critical for the effectiveness of these treatments. Bright light stimulation pushes the endogenous sleep period away from it like similar poles on a bar magnet (e.g. south/south) while the time of melatonin administration pulls the endogenous sleep period towards it like two opposite magnetic poles (e.g. north/south). The ‘push’ and ‘pull’ effects can be combined to shepherd the endogenous sleep period into the desired time (e.g. 2300-0700h). Other behavioural procedures and cognitive therapies can also be helpful in the treatment of these problematic circadian rhythm disorders.

      "title": "Diagnosis and care challenges in a patient with early onset familial dementia due to Kufs disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Evaluation of early onset dementia comes with a set of unique challenges. The pathway to a specific diagnosis of a rare genetic disorder like adult onset Kufs disease presents additional challenges. Kufs disease is an adult‐onset Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses which is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder which presents with dementia, myoclonus, epilepsy, extrapyramidal &amp; cerebellar involvements and has an incidence of 1 in 1,000,000 worldwide. We present the case of a 38‐year‐old gentleman who had presented with a six‐year history of progressive cognitive and behavioural symptoms of apathy, attention deficits, recent memory impairment, mutism, dysphagia, social incontinence all leading to significant biopsychosocial dysfunction. Patient had hypothyroidism for 6 years and was on irregular medication. History suggested major neurocognitive disorder in multiple siblings with both parents being cognitively normal. During the initial presentation, he had agitation, poor speech output, irritable affect, soft neurologic signs like Marfanoid habitus, albinotic eyes, hypotonia and high arched palate and no cerebellar signs. Pathway to care was complicated with magico‐religious model of illness accepted by the family members, stigma and fear of ostracization by society. Psychoeducation of the family about medical model and ensuring cooperativeness for evaluation was the initial challenge followed by diagnosis and management of behavioural problems. In addition to the routine dementia workup, CSF study, autoimmune panel and paraneoplastic panel was carried out. Elevated Anti‐TPO suggested possible Hashimoto’s encephalitis. After liaison with neurologist, pulse steroid courses were administered which initially resulted in transient speech improvement and emotional reactivity, but worsening of behavioural symptoms occurred subsequently. Patient required two further admissions during which ECT was administered resulting in significant improvement in aggression and improved fluency of speech, improvement in food intake and selfcare. MRI brain showed mild cerebellar atrophy, hypointense thalami,volume loss in the entire cortex, minimal T2 FLAIR hyperintensities periventricularly.Suspecting familial frontotemporal dementia, genetic counselling and testing was done .It reported positive for a novel splice region deletion variant in CTSF gene of autosomal recessive inheritance suggestive of Kufs disease. Psychoeducation, genetic counselling for other family members, psychosocial and supportive interventions for long‐term care were provided.",

Careful history taking or reviewing a home video provides valuable clues, but the gold standard remains video polysomnography (PSG). Some sleep-related movements do not represent “disorders” as such but are harmless, physiological motor phenomena, and are discussed because of their frequency and relevance in differential diagnostic considerations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Studies examining cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder have documented neuropsychologic impairment in some patients. Recollection memory, attention, and visual information processing may be particularly impaired in patients with bipolar illness. Cognitive impairment appears to worsen with illness progression, and may have a significant impact on function. Pharmacotherapy to treat bipolar disorder including lithium, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics may have varying effects on cognitive functioning. Treatment with atypical antipsychotics has been associated with improvement in various cognitive measures in patients with schizophrenia, and the little data available in patients with bipolar disorder suggest the potential for similar benefits. Studies to determine if current treatments for bipolar disorder can prevent, delay, or even improve cognitive dysfunction are needed.",

Lazy eye could be a new visual process disorder which ends within the patient perceiving a blurred image from one in all their eyes that isn't correctable with glasses or contact lenses. Vision defect could be a disorder of the sensory system that represents unilateral or bi-lateral reduction of acuity within which an organic cause can't be detected. The unwellness represents a syndrome of visual deficits, not solely a deterioration of acuity. This syndrome includes: presence of state of affairs phenomena, distinction sensitivity deterioration, deficits in accommodation, deterioration of abstraction orientation and ocular motility pathology . The common sickness like Diabetic retinopathy (DR) could be a common small vascular complications in patients with polygenic disease and should have a fast and weakening impact on visual acuity (VA), eventually resulting in visual impairment. These blood vessels grow in a trial to provide aerated blood to the hypoxic membrane. At any time throughout the progression of DR, patients with polygenic disease also can develop DME, that involves retinal thickening within the yellow spot. This management strategy for DR needs early detection and best glycemic management to slow the progression of sickness. Vision defect treatment is protracted and it's important to counsel not solely kid however the full family and to ascertain a relationship of trust between doctor and patient so as to urge high treatment compliance and high child motivation . Today, we have a tendency to notice that gas isn't the sole think about developing ROP. Higher gas level observation has led to higher management of the gas given to premature infants. Today, however, there's a rise in ROP because of the actual fact that baby care advances mean additional low weight premature infants square measure living.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CSF1R-related adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is characterized by executive dysfunction, memory decline, personality changes, motor impairments, and seizures. A frontal lobe syndrome (e.g., loss of judgment, lack of social inhibitors, lack of insight, and motor persistence) usually appears early in the disease course. The mean age of onset is usually in the fourth decade. Affected individuals eventually become bedridden with spasticity and rigidity. The disease course ranges from two to 30 or more years (mean: 8 years). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is suspected in individuals with characteristic clinical and brain MRI findings and is confirmed by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CSF1R. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive management includes: attention to general care and nutritional requirements; antiepileptic drugs for seizures; and antibiotic treatment for general and recurrent infections. Prevention of secondary complications: Information about and support systems for the social problems and suicidal tendencies often associated with disease progression. Surveillance: Periodic brain MRI and clinical evaluation to monitor disease progression. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Use of first-generation neuroleptics due to increased seizure risk and risk of additional parkinsonian signs; medications used to treat multiple sclerosis as they are of no benefit and have major side effects. Genetic counseling CSF1R-related ALSP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Individuals with CSF1R-related ALSP usually have an affected parent; de novo mutation can occur. Each child of an individual with CSF1R-related ALSP has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant in a family is known.",

      "abstract": "Subtle alterations in brain development caused by genes or early environmental hazards, such as obstetric complications, play a role in projecting some individuals on a trajectory toward schizophrenia. High-risk and cohort studies demonstrate that children destined to develop schizophrenia tend to have delayed milestones and subtle neuromotor and cognitive impairments (particularly in coordination and language). These neurocognitive problems lead to difficulties in interpersonal relations, and their progressive alienation makes these at-risk children more likely to harbor odd or paranoid ideas. This cascade of increasingly deviant development may then be compounded by brain maturational changes during adolescence with a resultant lability of the dopaminergic response to stress. As a result, the individual is more susceptible to the effects of the abuse of dopamine-releasing drugs, and to other risk factors such as migration or stressful life events; social isolation may be a common pathway underlying several of the social risk factors.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging in Epileptic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic disorders, and affects about 50 million people around the world. It is a heterogeneous condition characterized by recurrent spontaneous epileptic seizures. There are no age, sex or race discriminations, although incidence of the first epileptic seizure has a bimodal distribution, with peaks in childhood and after 60 years of age (Engel & Pedley, 2008). According to their localization, epilepsies and epileptic seizures should be classified as focal (or partial) and generalized. Partial seizures begin in a restricted portion of cerebral cortex. Partial seizures are associated with a restricted area of the of the cerebral cortex and are clasified as either simple or complex, depending on the level of conscious awareness. Simple partial seizures are characterized by brief specific neurologic dysfunction, contingent upon the localization of the epileptogenic focus. By definition, they do not compromise consciousness during the event, and might manifest as motor signs (with a focus involving the primary motor area), sensitive symptoms (focus in the primary somatosensory area), autonomic or psychic signs (mesiobasal areas). Complex partial seizures affect the patient’s consciousness from the onset of the event. Both simple and complex partial seizures can propagate to the whole brain and become secondarily generalized seizures. Examples of primary generalized seizures are absence seizures, tonic-clonic generalized seizures, and myoclonic seizures. All those three seizure types are generated by epileptic discharges involving both cerebral hemispheres from their onset. By extension, focal epilepsies are characterized by recurrent spontaneous partial seizures, and generalized epilepsies have generalized seizures as their main seizure type. Epilepsies can be idiopathic (without an identifiable structural cause), symptomatic (due to a structural lesion), or cryptogenic (with a presumed lesion, not detectable by current available neuroimaging methods). Broadly, idiopathic epilepsies (partial or generalized) begin in the childhood years, have a good prognosis, and go into remission during adolescence. The symptomatic generalized epilepsies encompass a group of epileptic syndromes with very poor prognosis, characterized by extremely refractory seizures and accompanied by neurodevelopmental delay. The symptomatic partial epilepsies depict a large spectrum of epileptic disorders caused by several types of brain lesions. A significant percentage of patients who have seizures not responsive to antiepileptic drugs is affected by this type of epilepsy. Surgical treatment becomes a good therapeutic option for these patients, and the identification of the structural cortical lesion causing their epilepsies is primordial for a good postsurgical prognosis (Panaiyotopoulos, 2010).",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become recognised as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the ageing population worldwide. Over 20 million people worldwide are affected by AD, which ensures that the disease imposes a major economic burden. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with characteristic clinical and neuropathological features. Neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques and amyloid angiopathy occur in varying severity in brains of patient's with Alzheimer's disease. Biological markers of AD allowing an early definitive premorbid diagnoses are currently not available. Memory loss for recent events is invariable and often the earliest prominent symptom. Language disorders, difficulties with complex tasks, depression, psychotic symptoms and behavioral changes are other common manifestations of AD. Diagnosis involves the early detection of cognitive decline and ruling out other causes of dementia like vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, fronto-temporal degeneration or reversible causes like hypothyroidism. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have shown to be effective in mild to moderate AD in improving the cognitive function of patients in clinical trials. Caregiver intervention programs have considerable potential to improve both the caregiver and patient quality of life.",

      "title": "Incidence Of Post-Operative Delirium In Geriatric Patients Undergoing Hip Replacement Surgery Using Pre-Operative Haloperidol",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "title": "REM sleep and emotion regulation",
      "abstract": "Despite substantial research focusing on the interaction between sleep and cognition, especially memory, the impact of sleep and sleep loss on affective and emotional regulation has comparatively attracted much less attention. This might be surprising considering that nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired mood express co-occurring abnormalities of sleep, and that many sleep disorders are accompanied by mood disturbances, thus suggesting an intimate relationship between sleep and emotion. Yet, recent studies evaluating subjective as well as objective measures of mood and affect, combined with insights from clinical observations and neuroimaging research, offer new evidence for the emerging role of sleep in regulating emotional brain function. In this chapter, we review clinical and neuroimaging data that support the existence of such complex interactions between sleep and emotion regulation. We report that (1) sleep disorders are frequently associated with affective symptoms; (2) patients with mood disorders often present with sleep disturbances; (3) sleep deprivation may transitorily alleviate depressive symptoms; (4) dream experiences may be highly emotional; (5) brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation, such as the limbic (e.g., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex) and ventromedial prefrontal regions, are strongly activated during REM sleep; (6) subjective mood assessments exhibit a circadian modulation. New data also show that some hypothalamic neuropeptides (hypocretin/orexin) play a dual role in the stabilization of sleep–wake states and on mesolimbic dopamine activity, with significant effects on neural plasticity related to emotional learning, reward processing, and addiction. Together, these seemingly disparate observations converge to indicate a physiological interplay between sleep–wake and emotional brain functions serving the modulation, the preparation, and the optimization of waking behavior.",

There are changes in sleep patterns that are normal with ageing but many changes are the sign of disordered sleep. Sleep can be divided into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM). Each has unique characteristics that are differentiated by their waveforms on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and by other physiological signals; several physiological age-related changes are thought to produce alterations in circadian rhythms. While there are numerous psychological and social factors contributing to quality and quantity of sleep, specific sleep disorders more prevalent in old age are insomnia, sleep apnea, and rapid eye movement disorder. Non-pharmacological treatment is effective in management of sleep disorders. Cognitive behaviour therapy is most effective to tackle insomnia. Cognitive behavior therapy along with meditation is beneficial for other sleep disorders and a new technique is also emerging: mindfulness.",

As such, the question is whether SLI and LKS should rather be considered along a continuum or as two entirely distinct entities. In addition, the rationale for using antiepileptic medications in rare forms of SLI is discussed.",

Sleep disturbance is the most common symptom in depressive patients, and it was formerly thought to be a major secondary manifestation of depression. Many longitudinal studies have identified insomnia as an independent risk factor for the development of emerging or recurrent depression in older adults, with bidirectional relationships between sleep quality and depression. This narrative review summarizes recent research or evidence on the sleep–depression association in older adults, as well as the potential common mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of sleep and depression disorders, focusing on the clock system, neurochemical substrates, and neurocircuits. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying sleep disturbance and depression can assist psychiatrists in better managing this comorbidity.",

      "abstract": "One of the main advantages of long-term recording of epileptics is the possibility to monitor these patients during natural sleep. In this chapter, we first describe the reciprocal influence of sleep and epilepsy. On the one hand, sleep and circadian fluctuation of the state of vigilance have a marked influence on the occurrence of generalized and partial seizures as well as on the frequency, morphology and distribution of interictal epileptic discharges. On the other hand, a wide range of sleep disturbances has been documented in epileptics and there is some evidence that sleep disturbance and epilepsy may aggravate and perpetuate one another. Long-term EEG monitoring during sleep is of major importance when investigating epileptics with nocturnal attacks to determine whether these nocturnal episodes represent an ictal manifestation or an independent non-epileptic sleep disorder. In special forms of epilepsy, sleep recording is not only useful but necessary for the diagnosis. Various activation procedures are carried out on patients in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty regarding the presence or the type of epilepsy. Some of these procedures employ sleep: namely sedated sleep, sleep after sleep deprivation and all-night sleep recording. The diagnostic value and the indications of these activation studies are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics LRRK2 Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by features consistent with idiopathic PD: initial motor features of slowly progressive asymmetric tremor at rest and/or bradykinesia, cogwheel muscle rigidity, postural instability, and gait abnormalities that may include festination and freezing. Certain nonmotor symptoms in LRRK2-PD, especially REM sleep behavior disorder and cognitive decline, may occur at similar or slightly reduced frequency compared to typical idiopathic* PD. Onset is generally after age 50, although early-onset (in the 20s) and late-onset (in the 90s) disease has been described. * Idiopathic PD refers to the presence of signs and symptoms of PD for which the etiology is currently unknown and in which there is no known family history of PD. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LRRK2-PD relies on clinical findings and the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in LRRK2. Management Treatment of manifestations: Symptomatic treatment of parkinsonism is the same as for idiopathic Parkinson disease: pharmacologic replacement of dopamine, most commonly accomplished with the precursor of dopamine, L-dopa, combined with carbi-dopa. Dopamine agonists may also be used, as well as monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, amantadine, and/or anticholinergics. Physical, occupational, and voice therapy may be beneficial. Exercise is often recommended. Treatment of nonmotor manifestations – e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, urinary issues, orthostatic hypotension – should be addressed based on individual manifestations. Surveillance: Annual evaluation for both motor and nonmotor symptoms. Motor evaluation focuses on gait and falls, slowness of movement and dexterity, tremor, and rigidity. Evaluation for nonmotor signs and symptoms includes assessment of constipation, mood disorder, impulse control disorders, other psychiatric disorders, cognitive changes, sleep disturbance, orthostatic hypotension, and urinary frequency. In addition, at least yearly evaluation for melanoma. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dopamine-blocking therapies may exacerbate parkinsonism. Genetic counseling LRRK2-PD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, given the reduced penetrance associated with LRRK2-PD, a high percentage of affected individuals report unaffected parents. De novo mutation may occur; its frequency is unknown. Each child of an individual with LRRK2 Parkinson disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. However, the risk of developing disease is lower than 50% because of age-related reduced penetrance. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.",

There has been a lack of clarity regarding the definition of DNS, as many sleep-related symptoms and conditions disrupt sleep quality in narcolepsy (eg, hallucinations, sleep paralysis, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, nightmares, restless legs syndrome/periodic leg movements, nocturnal eating, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety). In addition, the intrinsic sleep instability of narcolepsy results in frequent spontaneous wakings and sleep stage transitions, contributing to DNS. Sleep instability likely emerges in the setting of orexin insufficiency/deficiency, but its exact pathophysiology remains unknown. DNS impairs quality of life among people with narcolepsy, and more research is needed to determine its contributions to cardiovascular risk. Multimodal treatment is appropriate for DNS management, including behavioral therapies, counseling on sleep hygiene, and/or medication. There is strong evidence showing improvement in self-reported sleep quality and objective sleep stability measures with sodium oxybate, but rigorous clinical trials with other pharmacotherapies are needed. Treatment may be complicated by comorbidities, concomitant medications, and mood disorders.DNS is a common symptom of narcolepsy deserving consideration in clinical care and future research.Maski K, Mignot E, Plazzi G, Dauvilliers Y.

Recent research points to the existence of functional subcortical-prefrontal circuits which regulate human behaviour. There is a link between subcortical dementia and functional or structural break of one or more cortical-subcortical connections.

Seizures also occur in prion disorders and some frontotemporal lobar degenerationsyndromes, whereas parkinsonian dementia disorders seem relatively seizure free. Seizure pathogenesis in these conditions is uncertain,but may relate to neocortical and hippocampal hyperexcitability and synchronised activity, possibly as a consequence of dysfunctionalprotein metabolism, neuronal structural changes, and concurrent cerebrovascular disease. Alzheimerâ€™s disease may be a neuronalnetwork disorder, characterised by both cognitive decline and epileptic activity, in which seizures are an integral part of disease phenotyperather than epiphenomena.

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

      "abstract": "Abstract The question of whether an individual has experienced a seizure or has recurrent seizures (epilepsy) is often encountered in the forensic setting. Such questions are often raised in cases of alleged personal injury, usually in cases of apparent brain injury. The impact of seizures in a patient's life is also often at issue in cases involving disability law and employment discrimination. Occasionally, death or injuries related to epilepsy are at issue in the court, or the impact of a mother's use of antiepileptic drugs resulting in apparent birth defects. In the criminal arena, criminal acts are sometimes attributed to seizure activity or to brain dysfunction associated with epilepsy. Classification of seizures and epileptic syndromes are one goal of the assessment of the seizure disorder patient. Diagnostic methods include neurological examination, preferably by a neurologist skilled in the field of epileptology. The evaluation will also likely include EEG testing and brain imaging studies. Careful consideration of differential diagnosis issues is critical, as many medical and psychiatric syndromes closely resemble the presentation of seizure disorder. One key differential is ruling out psychogenic seizures or pseudoseizures. When seizures figure into a potential criminal defense (automatism) for aggressive behavior, careful forensic neurological assessment is warranted to determine the medicolegal validity of such a defense.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurological illness in the world, exactly after Alzheimer's disease. It is the long-term degenerative condition of a human being's central nervous system that primarily affects people over the age of sixty. Parkinson's disease is one of the many neurological conditions that progress over time. Problems with movement are the first symptoms. Initial indicators of the disease could also include vocal dysfunction. Humans diagnosed with Parkinson's have vocal abnormalities that impair their voice's loudness and cause difficulty in pronunciation. As a result, Parkinson's disease can be diagnosed using vocal measures. People may notice issues with common movements, tremors, stiffness in the limbs or trunk, or even decreased balance as neurons (nerve cells) in areas of the brain are weakened, get injured, or die. Patients may struggle with walking, talking, or accomplishing other simple tasks as these symptoms become more noticeable. However, like many other diseases and disorders, these symptoms also appear in other conditions. Thus, it is not necessary for everyone with one or more of these symptoms to have Parkinson's disease. This paper intends to implement 4 base machine learning classifiers and 4 proposed ensemble classifiers to compare and select the best possible model through a dataset of 23 attributes and around 177 records. It is concluded that the ensembles perform far better and are the best interchange between the XG Boost and Random Forest classifier.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

Nužan uvjet za ocuvanje sigurnosti na prometnicama su zdravstveni pregledi koji ce prevenirati da zdravstveno i psiholoski nesposoban vozac i dalje upravlja motornim vozilom i dovodi ostale sudionike u prometu u opasnost.\nKako bi utvrdili utjece li promjena zdravstvenog stanja uslijed starenja na vozacke sposobnosti, nasumicno je odabrano 25 ispitanika, vozaca starijih od 65 godina, to jest obrađeni su podaci iz medicinske dokumentacije nakon obavljenog zdravstvenog pregleda kod specijalista medicine rada u Domu zdravlja PGŽ. Rezultati pokazuju da su najcesca stanja i bolesti iz anamneze ispitanika hipertenzija (20%), bolesti krvožilja (14%,) i dijabetes (8%), a cak vise od polovice ispitanika je pretrpjelo frakture ili bilo hospitalizirano. 88% ispitanika je proglaseno ograniceno sposobnima, jedan ispitanik je proglasen sposobnim, a dvoje su proglaseni nesposobnima. Najcesce su Uvjerenja izdana na rok važenja od 2 ili 5 godina Nisu svi istraživaci složni oko odgovora na pitanje jesu li stariji vozaci rizicni, ali statistike za Hrvatsku prema podacima MUP-a govore da stariji vozaci uzrokuju 2/3 nesreca u kojima sudjeluju. Ako uzmemo u obzir da svi stariji vozaci koji su registrirani da posjeduju vozacku dozvolu ne voze, te da voze na znatno kracim relacijama, ovaj postotak je poražavajuci.\nIpak, nakon vise promjena zakona koji regulira kriterije za zdravstveni pregled vozaca , sada je na snazi zakon prema kojem je zdravstveni pregled obavezan samo ako je to navedeno u Uvjerenju dobivenom prije osposobljavanja vozaca. U europskim zemljama zdravstveni pregled je obavezan za starije vozace (Spanjolska, Velika Britanija, Svedska, Norveska), a jedino u Njemackoj je odgovornost o zdravstvenoj sposobnosti povjerena odabranom lijecniku vozaca. (11) Moguce je da ce se taj zakon uskoro opet mijenjati i možda uskladiti s nekim od europskih zakona.",

      "abstract": "In addition to typical motor dysfunction (parkinsonism), diverse non-motor symptoms (NMS) are frequently observed in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Some NMS may antedate the diagnosis of PD. Examples of NMS include cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, visual dysfunction, sleep abnormalities and psychiatric disorders. NMS are associated with wide-ranging abnormalities in extranigral dopaminergic systems and non-dopaminergic (e.g. cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic) systems. The type and severity of NMS vary based on age, disease severity and predominant motor symptoms. NMS can be disabling and reduce quality of life. Treatment of NMS can be challenging. Some NMS are helped by dopaminergic treatment, whereas others can be induced or exacerbated by treatments that help the motor dysfunction. Physicians should probe their PD patients about their NMS and address them for better care. Clinical trials should incorporate NMS as outcomes for more meaningful conclusions on the effect of treatments under investigation.",

      "title": "Functional cognitive disorder: dementia’s blind spot",
      "abstract": "Abstract An increasing proportion of cognitive difficulties are recognized to have a functional cause, the chief clinical indicator of which is internal inconsistency. When these symptoms are impairing or distressing, and not better explained by other disorders, this can be conceptualized as a cognitive variant of functional neurological disorder, termed functional cognitive disorder (FCD). FCD is likely very common in clinical practice but may be under-diagnosed. Clinicians in many settings make liberal use of the descriptive term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for those with cognitive difficulties not impairing enough to qualify as dementia. However, MCI is an aetiology-neutral description, which therefore includes patients with a wide range of underlying causes. Consequently, a proportion of MCI cases are due to non-neurodegenerative processes, including FCD. Indeed, significant numbers of patients diagnosed with MCI do not ‘convert’ to dementia. The lack of diagnostic specificity for MCI ‘non-progressors’ is a weakness inherent in framing MCI primarily within a deterministic neurodegenerative pathway. It is recognized that depression, anxiety and behavioural changes can represent a prodrome to neurodegeneration; empirical data are required to explore whether the same might hold for subsets of individuals with FCD. Clinicians and researchers can improve study efficacy and patient outcomes by viewing MCI as a descriptive term with a wide differential diagnosis, including potentially reversible components such as FCD. We present a preliminary definition of functional neurological disorder–cognitive subtype, explain its position in relation to other cognitive diagnoses and emerging biomarkers, highlight clinical features that can lead to positive diagnosis (as opposed to a diagnosis of exclusion), and red flags that should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses. In the research setting, positive identifiers of FCD will enhance our recognition of individuals who are not in a neurodegenerative prodrome, while greater use of this diagnosis in clinical practice will facilitate personalized interventions.",

The nervous system is highly complex and physicians are sufficiently sophisticated with determining dysfunctions of individual subsystems of the nervous system. The term neurological failure is a misnomer. The authors have defined as altered consciousness and/or convulsions requiring intensive care unit (ICU) management. Clearly, the patient who is comatose or stuporous with a profound encephalopathy would meet the definition. But what about a patient with a mild dementia who has a generalized tonic/clonic seizure with a prolonged postictal period, or a patient who is aphasic or develops a hemianopsia or hemiparesis?

      "title": "Differentiating Delirium Versus Dementia in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Altered mental status is one of the most common presenting symptoms in elderly patients often related to 3 Ds- delirium, dementia, and depression. Out of the 3 Ds, Delirium and dementia are more commonly encountered in clinical practice. Most of the time, the two terms are used interchangeably and therefore unrecognized on the initial assessment. It is critically important to understand that delirium and dementia are distinct syndromes with different prognoses and management. While an acute confusional state that fluctuates and develops over days to weeks is likely to be delirium, a more persistent and chronic progression suggests dementia. This distinction is blurred in cases of persistent delirium and reversible dementia. Cognition is assessed in six domains: memory and learning, language, executive functioning, complex attention, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. Delirium is characterized by altered awareness mainly affecting attention, whereas dementia is defined as cognitive decline, which interferes with 1 or more domains. Delirium is an abrupt onset of reduced orientation or awareness to the environment in contrast to dementia which is a gradual process leading to disturbance in the core features, and attention is affected much later in the disease course. Typically, dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder seen in older age and is of various subtypes with the age of onset depending on the subtype. On the other hand, delirium is an age-independent process that occurs more commonly in elderly patients and can happen under variable circumstances. Delirium typically occurs from hours to days, versus dementia is a slow progressive course over months to years. Often the two coexists in the elderly, and sometimes when the dementia is rapidly progressive. It can be difficult to differentiate the two in patients without a prior history of dementia. Therefore, it becomes essential to distinguish between the two or to discern if superadded delirium in a pre-existing dementia patient (delirium superimposed dementia or DSD) leads to a prolonged hospital stay and accelerated cognitive and functional decline, increased healthcare costs, and ultimately death.",

      "title": "Main neuroendocrine features and therapy in primary sleep troubles.",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a sleep trouble in which the patient has difficulties in falling or in staying asleep. There are patients who fall asleep easily, but wake up too early; others have troubles in falling asleep and a third category has troubles with both falling and staying asleep. Independent of the type of insomnia, the final result is a poor-quality sleep, responsible for depressive or irritable mood, loss in concentration, learning and memory capacities. Sleep is essential to emotional and physical health. Inadequate sleep over a period of time is increasing the risks for obesity, diabetes, heart disease and depression. People suffering of chronic insomnia show an increased predisposition for psychiatric problems. People who had sleep troubles reported impaired ability to fulfill tasks involving memory, learning, logical reasoning and mathematical operations. New studies show that insomnia might be a result of the decrease of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurochemical responsible for the decrease of activity in many brain areas. Lower brain GABA levels were also found in people with major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. Hypnotics, such as benzodiazepines are acting increasing the activity of the GABA neurons. Exposure to stress is associated with a greater risk for insomnia, with individual differences. Stress activates the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Increased activity of HPA axis is stimulating the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone, further inducing sleep disruption. Insomnia is also associated with depression and anxiety disorders, in which the HPA axis is characteristically overactive. People who show predisposition to sleep troubles have a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system, they are usually suffering from hyperarousal and they have a more intense response to stressful events. Primary sleep troubles (insomnia) has no apparent causes, is lasting more than one month, and is affecting approximately a quarter of the adult population. Secondary insomnia is associated with chronic heart and/or lung diseases, medication which interfere with onset or duration of sleep, constant change of the sleep habits, restless leg syndrome, etc. Besides lifestyle changes and cogn itive-behavioral therapy, in the treatment of insomnia are used hypnotic medicines, advised to be prescribed on short-term cures of one or two weeks. Benzodiazepines are inducing and maintaining sleep. Longer use is responsible for severe side effects--dependency and withdrawal syndrome, daytime drowsiness and dizziness, low blood pressure, memory troubles and change in the melatonin secretion during night-time period. For these reasons were created non-benzodiazepines hypnotics--zolpidem, zaleplon, which are as effective as benzodiazepines, but have fewer side effects. Nevertheless the use of these hypnotics is also restricted to 7-10 days. Zopiclone (Imovane) another short-acting non-benzodiazepine hypnotic has a different chemical structure, but a pharmacologic profile similar to that of the benzod iazepines; the treatment should be of maximum four weeks. Besides generally known concerns related to the use of hypnotics (residual sedative effects, memory impairment, rebound insomnia, abuse, dose escalation, dependency and withdrawal problems) it was signaled a risk of death associated with the use of current hypnotic medications.",

One useful strategy is to determine if a patient has a constellation of symptoms and findings that fits within a broad category or syndrome, which then narrows the differential diagnosis and allows the clinician to commence a focused work-up. For example, the differential diagnosis and spectrum of available diagnostic studies for a patient with dementia, or a patient with parkinsonism, are rather wide; these are far more restricted in those who have elements of both dementia and parkinsonism. Furthermore, an insidious onset and progressive course suggests a neurodegenerative disease as the likely underlying process.

The physical examination showed widespread weakness, atrophy, fasciculation, and brisk reflexes. The initial electrodiagnostic test showed widespread active and chronic denervation findings. The initial physical and electrodiagnostic findings were suggestive of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). However, blood serology indicated possible Lyme disease. Thus, the patient was treated with doxycycline. The clinical and electrodiagnostic findings were resolved with the treatment. Conclusion and Relevance: The diagnosis of Lyme disease can be very challenging and it can mimic other neurological disorders such as ALS or Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS).

In neurobiological terms, consciousness may be viewed as having an arousal dimension and an awareness dimension phenotypically expressed as the capacity to respond to self or environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness is associated with lesions that disrupt neuronal systems in the brainstem and diencephalon that mediate arousal or thalamocortical or corticocortical systems that mediate awareness.

PNES are not characterized by any specific ictal or postictal EEG abnormalities. Patients with PNES can present with motor or non-motor symptoms, frequently associated with a change in the level of consciousness. PNES duration is variable, often longer than that of epileptic seizures. Prolonged PNES, sometimes termed PNES status, involve continuous or repetitive events that exceed 30 min. Prolonged PNES are often misdiagnosed as an epileptic event and are often inappropriately treated with high doses of antiseizure drugs. In this report, we describe two adolescent patients who presented with prolonged PNES characterized by generalized hypertonic posturing and low levels of consciousness. Despite multiple presentation to the Emergency department, and multiple normal video-EEG, the patients were misdiagnosed with epilepsy and were inappropriately treated with antiseizure medications. Both patients presented psychiatric comorbidity, consisting of a major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, social withdrawal, difficulty of social interaction, and anxious-perfectionist personality traits.

      "title": "Anosognosia in patients with Alzheimer's disease: current perspectives",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by neurocognitive impairments, especially memory impairment, as core symptoms linked to reductions in activities of daily life. As marginal symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) appear during the progressive course of the disease. A lack of self-awareness (anosognosia) of cognitive and functional impairments is often seen in patients with AD, and associations between anosognosia and other NPSs have been previously reported. To account for anosognosia pathogenesis neurocognitively, the cognitive awareness model (CAM) has been helpful for explaining the stream of events from sensory input to behavioural/affective and metacognitive outputs. According to CAM, there are three types of anosognosia: (i) primary anosognosia, (ii) executive anosognosia, and (iii) mnemonic anosognosia. These types of anosognosia are generated from different neurocognitive modulations leading to metacognitive outputs or behavioural/affective regulations. Primary anosognosia is considered to be caused by deficits in the metacognitive awareness system (MAS). While preserved MAS function is associated with milder depression and anxiety in AD, a severer depressive mood in patients with mild AD can inversely cause self-underestimation. The modulation of executive anosognosia is thought to be associated with dangerous/disinhibition behaviours and apathy among NPS sub-symptoms, via impairments of comparator mechanism (Cm) within the central executive system. Other neurobehavioral reactions linked to self-awareness include 'denying' and 'confabulation', and each of these reactions is thought to be affected by the MAS and a Cm. Denial of one's own memory impairments appears as a defensive reaction to protect against dysphoric feelings, and the confabulatory comment is instantly reaction constructed by fabrications according to misinterpretations of memory information about oneself. Similarly, the innovative development of a theoretical model (CAM) has contributed to explaining the mechanism of anosognosia and some neurobehavioral outputs from a neurocognitive perspective.",

However, Lawrence-­Moon­-Barde­-Biedl syndrome may also present with other secondary abnormalities, including ataxia, diabetes insipidus, and dental abnormalities. Clinical changes of the eyes include retinitis pigmentosa, low visual acuity, and vision loss, often due to photoreceptor disorders in the retinal tissue with macular degeneration, leading to night blindness and then, in most cases, can cause complete blindness. In patients with an archetypal manifestation of Lawrence­-Moon­-Barde-­Biedl syndrome, abdominal obesity is common, even if the birth weight is usually normal. In addition, this group of patients has type 2 diabetes mellitus. A distinctive feature of this syndrome is postaxial polydactyly.

In the first part of this review, the relationship between sleep and anxiety is discussed in terms of adaptive response to stress. Recent studies suggested that the corticotropin-releasing hormone system and the locus ceruleus-autonomic nervous system may play major roles in the arousal response to stress. It has been suggested that these systems may be particularly vulnerable to prolonged or repeated stress, further leading to a dysfunctional arousal state and pathological anxiety states, Polysomnographic studies documented limited alteration of sleep in anxiety disorders. There is some indication for alteration in sleep maintenance in generalized anxiety disorder and for both sleep initiation and maintenance in panic disorder; no clear picture emerges for obsessive-compulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder. Finally, an unequivocal sleep architecture profile that could specifically relate to a particular anxiety disorder could not be evidenced; in contrast, conflicting results are often found for the same disorder. Discrepancies between studies could have been related to illness severity, diagnostic comorbidity, and duration of illness. A brief treatment approach for each anxiety disorder is also suggested with a special focus on sleep.",

      "title": "Genetics of Epileptic Encephalopathies",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epileptic encephalopathy (EE) is a descriptive term for a group of severe epilepsy disorders characterised predominantly by early onset drug‐resistant seizures, accompanied by developmental stagnation or regression secondary to epileptiform activity. The aetiological diagnosis of EE is challenging, as causes are numerous with significant phenotypic overlap: these include acquired causes as well as numerous de novo or inherited monogenic seizure disorders, genetic inborn errors of metabolism, intellectual disability syndromes and chromosomal aberrations. A diagnostic pathway should include consultation with a Paediatric Neurologist and Clinical Geneticist, screening for immediately treatable causes, neuroimaging and electroencephalogram (EEG) and genetic testing including chromosomal microarray and consideration of a next generation sequencing technique that can interrogate multiple genetic causes, such as a multigene panel, or exome/genome sequencing. Understanding the underlying genetic cause of EE can allow accurate genetic counselling for the family and providing personalised management and support. Key Concepts EE is a descriptive term for a group of disorders where epileptiform activity itself contributes to severe cognitive and behavioural impairments above and beyond what might be expected from the underlying pathology. Although EE can be acquired, most cases of previously considered cryptogenic EE are now recognised to be due to single gene disorders. The majority of monogenic EE are due to de novo pathogenic variants: however, up to 10% of EE may be due to X‐linked or autosomal recessive conditions, with higher rates in populations where consanguineous marriage is more common. Although there are some genotype/phenotype correlations, a single genetic cause can result in a variety of EE and non‐EE phenotypes, and each subtype of EE can have a variety of genetic causes. Genetic heterogeneity in EE limits the value of targeted genetic testing. An optimal, cost‐effective diagnostic approach involves first‐tier tests that target common and treatable conditions, followed by second‐tier tests including sequencing of a panel of genes known to cause EE or exome/whole genome sequencing to allow genome‐wide interrogation. Factors influencing choice of type of genetic test (multigene panel versus exome/genome sequencing) include epilepsy semiology, developmental regression, additional neurological or extra‐cerebral manifestations, family history and clinician and patient choice and cost. Phenotypic factors that suggest exome/genome sequencing may be valuable and include developmental regression and progressive features, multiorgan involvement including dysmorphism, additional neurological features and cerebral malformations. Evaluation of the likely pathogenicity of a novel genetic variant should include consideration of similarity with the types of genetic variants previously identified as causal of EE for that gene, including which functional domain(s) are implicated as well as overlap with the associated clinical features previously described for that condition. For variants remaining of uncertain clinical significance, ongoing pathogenicity assessment will be required in the light of advances in the understanding of the genetics of EE.",

      "abstract": "Recurrent lucid dreaming is unusual and may be associated with an underlying sleep disorder. These are clear, emotionally pleasant dreams where the person is aware they are dreaming and capable of controlling content. They are usually initiated from REM sleep, but without loss of atonia. However, pathologic lucid dreams are associated with negative content and can result in sleep disruption with excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue. The etiology is unknown and we present a case of pathologic lucid dreams occurring after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. A 58-year-old man presents with complaints of sleep fragmentation beginning 15 years earlier since he was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. He experienced lucid dreaming since young adulthood without negative symptoms. Since his fibromyalgia, he complains of frequent purposeful awakening from his dreams due to unpleasant content and difficulty controlling them. He now feels as if he is awake throughout the night and has excess daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography showed increased REM and absent slow wave sleep without obstructive sleep apnea, REM behavior disorder or abnormal movements, or seizures. Treatment for fibromyalgia included various opiates, antidepressants, and pregabalin without improvement in sleep. We initiated prazosin and very low dose methadone, which resulted in improvement sleep fragmentation, tolerance to dream content, and frequency of dreams. Additionally, he had improved daytime function, decreased pain and daytime sleepiness. Lucid dreams are unusual, but are considered normal. However, pathologic lucid dreams are abnormal. The etiology and prevalence are unknown. Patients may be misdiagnosed with nightmares or hypersomnia with possible narcolepsy. Because he responded to prazosin and methadone treatment, we hypothesize that increased hypersensitivity of the monoaminergic system secondary to uncontrolled fibromyalgia may have been the reason behind these pathologic lucid dreams.",

In this condition, the clinical features of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) converge. Both PD and DLB populations have different sleep disturbances that are amplified when combined. Hence, sleep disruption is often significant and multifactorial in PDD. It is proposed that sleep–wake neural networks are affected early in the neurodegenerative process. The resultant lack of sleep results in impaired clearance of toxic metabolites, hastening disease progress. As the motor and nonmotor symptoms of PDD worsen, sleep becomes more disturbed. Medications used to control these symptoms can be sedating or cause insomnia. Comorbid sleep disorders are also often present. All of these factors contribute to poor sleep in these patients. Management is centered on symptom control, quality of life, and treatment of comorbidities.",

The term ‘acute confusional state’ is often used synonymously with ‘delirium’. Delirium may be associated with a range of associated clinical features including increased or decreased psychomotor activity (hyperactive and hypoactive variants), hallucinations and delusions, and efferent sympathetic hyperactivity. Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause. In some patients, however, delirium may be followed by long-term cognitive impairment, suggesting that the pathophysiology of delirium overlaps with that of dementia.",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced dyschromatopsias are defined as functional or objective alterations of color sense following drug treatment. Drug induced chromatopsias are characterized by a perception of white surfaces as colored and occur following modifications of normally transparent structures or alterations of the chorioretina or higher centers. Digitalic intoxication is responsible for incorrect perception of yellow or blue; the retinal origin of the disorder is confirmed by electroretinograms and histologic modifications in the photoreceptor synapses. Santonin in doses exceeding 1 cg is associated with various color misperceptions due to injury to a peripheral neuron or problems of rhodopsin formation. Some sulfas and antibiotics may cause misperception of yellow, and the anticonvulsant drug Tridione may cause an almost complete disappearance of some colors. Chromotopsias of central origin due to direct action on cerebral neurons are rare but may follow use of phenacetine or atropine. Drug induced dyschromatopsias are more common and may be the initial symptoms of various kinds of drug intoxication. Various simple and reliable tests enable the practicing clinician to detect such disorders at an early stage. Synthetic antimalarial drugs derived from chloroquine and used in longterm treatment of rheumatism or during antimalarial prophylaxis, indomethacine, and the phenotiazins may cause dyschromatopsias due to retinal intoxication. Oral contraceptives diminish the chromatic perception in 20% of cases according to 1 author, and often cause deficits of blue-yellow perception. Disulfiram, certain antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, nystatin, isoniazide, and other drugs may cause dyschromatopsias due to alterations in the optical fibers. Ethambutol is the most harmful to color perception; its effects are usually but not always reversible on discontinuation of the drug. Systematic tests of color perception should be administered prior to and during treatment with any drug known to affect the color sense.",

A probable hereditary or familial occurrence could be suggested in all patients. One merosin-positive patient presented severe motor incapacity and cerebral atrophy without any clinical manifestation of central nervous system involvement. A second patient, also merosin-positive, had moderate motor and mental handicap, and epilepsy with no changes in neuroimaging. A third patient, found to have partial merosin deficiency by muscle biopsy, manifested severe psychomotor retardation and cerebral atrophy with foci of abnormal white-matter signal on magnetic resonance imaging. Finally, two merosin-positive siblings with microcephaly, mental retardation, and an incapacitating progressive neuromuscular course, exhibited cataracts without defects of neuronal migration or brain malformation. This report emphasizes the broad clinical spectrum and heterogeneity of merosin-positive congenital muscular dystrophy with associated central nervous system involvement, and illustrates the importance of further studies on clinical, immunohistochemical, and genetic grounds for identifying new subsets of congenital muscular dystrophy.

      "abstract": "Facial neuropathy is most commonly seen as an idiopathic unilateral palsy known as Bell’s palsy. Generally, acute onset of typical lower motor neuron facial weakness that is not associated with other atypical or suspicious features, remains unilateral, and recovers completely requires no further workup. A recurrent or bilateral peripheral facial palsy makes an idiopathic cause less likely and prompts a more in-depth workup. The appropriate work-up of unilateral or bilateral facial palsy guided by the presence or absence of associated clinical findings is discussed. The major differentials for bilateral facial paresis include brainstem (especially pontine and prepontine) tumors, Lyme disease (especially in endemic areas), basal menigitides, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and sarcoidosis.",

Several physiologic and biologic changes take place during aging that have implications for medication-related adverse effects, atypical disease presentations, and the way the aging body responds to stress. The current hospital model can be a restrictive, unfamiliar, and threatening environment, particularly for a patient with mild dementia, poor mobility, decreased hearing, or visual disturbances. Delirium requires the presence of acute onset and fluctuating course, inattention and disorganized thinking, or altered level of consciousness. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been known to reduce the risk of recurrent disabling stroke or death in patients with severe ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis. Cerebrovascular risk factors (CVRFs) predispose the patient to stroke or heart attack and are more likely to cause depressive symptoms after stroke.",

      "abstract": "Sensory deprivation speeds up the degenerative changes normally associated with aging and enhances the loss of functional cells in the central nervous system. Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

The presence of tremor, asymmetry, cognitive decline, cerebellar abnormalities, and autonomic dysfunction helps to define the cause. Parkinson disease (PD) is the most common of the parkinsonian syndrome, and is defined by asymmetric resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Patients with PD respond to levodopa in the early stages of the disease, but become less responsive and develop more drug-related side effects and disability as the disease progresses. Progressive supranuclear palsy usually presents with gait difficulty, and the key diagnostic clue is difficulty with downward saccadic eye movements. Multiple system atrophy may include cerebellar and autonomic features that overshadow the extrapyramidal ones.

We report an unusual differential diagnosis for myasthenia gravis. Case Report A 56-year-old woman presented with worsening blurry vision, double vision, eyelid droopiness, slurred speech, and fatigable limb weakness, worsening over a 6-month period. On neurological examination, she showed dysarthric speech, ptosis, and proximal limb weakness with preserved reflexes. Myasthenia gravis was considered strongly, but serological and electrodiagnostic testing did not confirm the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. At subsequent visits, the patient developed headaches and downbeating nystagmus, and a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a Chiari type I malformation. Conclusions Chiari type I malformation is an unusual differential for sero-negative myasthenia gravis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, carried out in patients with all classical signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis, helps identify this anomaly. Headaches, although a classic feature of Chiari type I malformation, need not be an early manifestation. Eyelid ptosis as a manifestation of Chiari malformation has not been reported in the literature.",

In addition to motor and non-motor manifestations of Parkinson’s disease, there are a number of symptoms, including speech disorders and other cognitive impairments. The most common speech symptoms are bradylalia, dysarthria, hypophonia and impaired prosody. Cognitive changes that occur in the prodromal phase of PD include impairment in executive functions and working memory, followed by impairment in attention and verbal fluency, and that is before the motor characteristics of PD become visible. The aim of the study is to present the case of a 74-year-old patient with Parkinson’s disease who has speech and language difficulties and atypical speech disfluency. Diagnostic processing was performed using a clinical battery of tests for speech – language assessment and neuropsychological assessment. The results of the speech – language assessment indicate significantly reduced intelligence due to non-specific speech disfluency and inaccurate articulation, difficulty in organizing spontaneous expression and understanding grammatical structures, impaired phonemic verbal fluency and difficulties in receptive vocabulary. Neuropsychological processing indicated diffuse deterioration of the examined cognitive functioning to be larger than expected when taking ito consideration the age and probably good premorbid abilities of this person.",

      "abstract": "Dementia is a clinical syndrome commonly encountered in clinical practice. Early onset cognitive impairment is always of particular concern and warrants further workup for diagnostic clarity, potentially reversible causes, and prognosis. Unfortunately, although there is increasing knowledge of certain patterns of early onset neurodegenerative disorders, such as early onset Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, more atypical cases exist that do not fit these molds. Here, the case is presented of a 67-year-old man who first developed cognitive impairment at age 47 years. He also had a history of hyperlipidemia, hypogonadism, Lyme disease, anxiety, and attention-deficit disorder. He developed executive function deficits, impaired concentration, apathy, and gait disturbance, which led to loss of job, reduction in household responsibilities, and social isolation. He underwent extensive neuropsychiatric workup and several treatment attempts (for Lyme disease and attention-deficit disorder) over the subsequent 20 years; however, he had progressive indolent neurocognitive decline. This workup ruled out known causes of neurodegeneration but was consistent with early onset atypical parkinsonism with dementia of unspecified etiology. This case demonstrates the course of an early onset dementia that, despite exhaustive medical workup, remains diagnostically unclear. This scenario is common across medical specialties, although not often written about. This article synthesizes the individual approaches of neurologists, psychiatrists, radiologists, infectious disease specialists, and psychologists when presented with the same case and the effective multidisciplinary integration of these efforts even when the exact diagnosis remains unknown.",

Case Reports: Presented are two cases demonstrating that it is prudent to be aware of medications capable of inducing oculomotor dysfunction. Each case reveals instances of acute oculomotor dysfunction after the initiation of a central nervous system affecting medication. Case 1 details a partial pupil sparing third nerve palsy after initiating the anti-anxiety drug, buspirone. Case 2 accounts the addition of zolpidem (Ambien), a sedative, and the subsequent new onset nystagmus and hypertropia. Conclusion: In each case, no organic etiology was found, and the oculomotor dysfunction resolved following discontinuation of the recently added CNS affecting medication. Specific drug interactions are also considered as contributing factors to the oculomotor dysfunction in both cases.",

By limiting glucose supply to the brain the deficit of glucose transporter 1 leads to cerebral energy deficiency. Glut1-DS manifests with a wide range of neurological symptoms that usually start in early childhood, including cognitive impairment, epilepsy and permanent and/or paroxysmal motor disorders, often provoked by physical activity, fasting or hyperthermale. Aim. We present the case of a 6,5-year-old patient with Glut1- -DS who, despite presenting typical symptoms, remained undiagnosed for years. Family history was positive of intellectual disability in first degree relative. The child suffered from psychomotor development delay, motor coordination difficulties, motor disorders and epilepsy with focal and absence seizures of early onset. However, the significant symptom of secondary microcephaly remained unnoticed for years. Conclusion. Secondary microcephaly is a valuable symptom which can guide towards the diagnosis. The early diagnosis of Glut1 deficiency syndrome enables prompt introduction of the ketogenic diet crucial for the child’s development and improvement of both the patients and their families’ quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The Central Nervous System (CNS) is composed of cellular components organized in a complex structure that is unlike other organ systems. At the macroscopic level, the parenchyma of the CNS can be categorized into two structurally and functionally unique components: gray and white matter. The CNS can be divided into a number of anatomic regions, each with specific neurologic or cognitive functions. Disease or damage to these regions produces neurologic or cognitive deficits that correlate with the anatomic location and extent of disease. There are several ways to divide these structures. The main divisions are the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Developmental neuropathology encompasses a broad variety of cerebral malformations and functional impairments caused by disturbances of brain development, manifesting during ages from the embryonic period through adolescence and young adulthood. The neurologic and psychiatric manifestations of neurodevelopmental disorders range widely depending on the affected neural systems and include such diverse manifestations as epilepsy, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, breathing disorders, ataxia, autism, and schizophrenia. In terms of morbidity and mortality, the spectrum is extremely broad: the mildest neurodevelopmental disorders can be asymptomatic, while the worst malformations often lead to intrauterine or neonatal demise. This chapter focuses on the genetic disorders of brain development, caused by mutations of gene loci or chromosomal regions with important neurodevelopmental functions.",

Here we aim to outline an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis of patients who present with a somatosensory disorder which also involves at least one other area of neurological impairment such as the vestibular, auditory, or cerebellar systems. Recent findings Detailed objective investigation of patients who present with sensory impairment, particularly where the degree of imbalance is greater than would be expected, aids the accurate diagnosis of genetic, autoimmune, metabolic, and toxic neurological disease.

It is an inflammation of the central nervous system expressed by neurological and psychiatric symptoms, which makes the diagnosis difficult. It is important to know how to quickly identify it and to set up rapid support. It mainly affects young women and the psychiatric manifestations are: anxiety, agitation, behavioral disturbances, delusions and depressive symptoms. Then appear neurological symptoms such as partial or generalized convulsions, abnormal movements, and other cognitive disorders. And the natural course will be disorders of the autonomic nervous system leading to sequelae or even death. The detection of anti NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antibodies in the CSF may make the diagnosis more certain. Our patient illustrates the difficulties found in the diagnosis of this pathology, the patient presented psychiatric and neurological manifestations justifying an etiological approach, of the metabolic, infectious, neuro-vascular, psychiatric causes, successively. The diseases were looked and ruled out thanks to the realization of investigations specific to each etiology. Autoimmune encephalitis should be systematically mentioned and is part of the differential diagnosis of infectious acute encephalitis. This pathology is frequent and the absence of specific treatment puts in danger the patient's vital prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Neuromyositis defined as the association of dermatomyositis or polymyositis and a neuropathy without any found cause is a very controversial entity because of the possibility of, in one hand, muscular modifications caused by neurological involvement and, on the other hand, neurogenic type manifestations caused by polymyositis. The study of 4 cases seen in an Internal Medicine department and the review of the literature allowed us to show that the concept of neuromyositis corresponds to a clinico-pathological reality when the diagnosis is based on the association of definite criteria of both primary muscle and nerve involvement excluding muscular abnormalities that could be the consequence of nerve involvement and vice versa. The criteria, most relevant when associated are: a) for muscular involvement: high increase of muscular enzyme over 6 times the superior limit of the normal values, pseudomyotonic electrical discharges, perifascicular atrophy, intense inflammatory infiltrates and massive necrosis, b) for neurological involvement: early abolition of tendinous reflexes in a patient without notable muscular atrophy and with little or no myalgia, sensitive abnormalities in areas other than those of muscular involvement, especially when they are intense, early weakness of distal muscles, decrease of nerve conduction speed, target fibers and lesions of nerve trunks (and albuminocytological dissociation in the particular case of polyradiculoneuritis). Once the diagnosis of neuropathy settled, it is necessary to exclude an usual cause (alcoholism, diabetes...) before concluding to neuromyositis. When we apply these restrictive (but nevertheless necessary for the validity of diagnosis) criteria, only 6 cases of the literature respond to this entity. It is a peripheral neuropathy in 5 cases (like two of ours) and a polyradiculoneuritis in one case (like our two others). Among these 6 cases, there is a vasculitis in two, frequency much higher to what is observed in adult polymyositis, which suggest a possible causative role of vascular involvement in neuropathy arising. In the other cases we can just give pathogenic hypothesis making the neuropathy and the polymyositis the result of the same process (immunological disturbance, paraneoplastic origin, viral disease). In one of our four patients, who have shown an HTLV-I infection by polymerase chain reaction in situ hybridization was positive in muscle which suggest a direct pathogenic role of the virus. HTLV-I infection should be considered as a possible cause of neuromyositis especially in endemic areas.",

Commonly reported manifestations of cognitive impairment include deficits in attention, conceptual reasoning, processing efficiency, information processing speed, memory (episodic and working), verbal fluency (language), and executive functions. Multiple sclerosis patients also suffer from social cognition impairment, which affects their social functioning. The objective of the current paper is to assess the effect of neurocognitive impairment and its potential correlation with social cognition performance and impairment in multiple sclerosis patients.An overview of the available-to-date literature on neurocognitive impairment and social cognition performance in multiple sclerosis patients by disease subtype was performed.It is not clear if social cognition impairment occurs independently or secondarily to neurocognitive impairment. There are associations of variable strengths between neurocognitive and social cognition deficits and their neural basis is increasingly investigated.The prompt detection of neurocognitive predictors of social cognition impairment that may be applicable to all multiple sclerosis subtypes and intervention are crucial to prevent further neural and social cognition decline in multiple sclerosis patients.",

Delirium can interfere dramatically with the recognition and control of other physical and psychological symptoms such as pain in later stages of illness. Delirium is one of the most common mental disorders encountered in general hospital practice. Delirium is highly prevalent in cancer and AIDS patients with advanced disease, particularly in the terminally ill patients in the last weeks of life, with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 88%.

      "abstract": "The presence of additional disabilities (AD) in children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and influence of AD on age of hearing loss diagnosis and amplification were investigated. It was shown that 41% children with SNHL have different AD - pathology of the central neural system (including mental retardation, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficits), vision, motor and articulation impairments, cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, digestive, endocrine diseases etc. 59% children among them have 2-3 AD. The most often combination of AD was pathology of central neural and motor systems. The genetic factor was revealed rarely in the group of children with AD than in children with SNHL only. The diagnosis of hearing loss before age 4 months was rarely in the group of children with AD. Possibly it is because of the most of such children got treatment in neonatal intensive care unit and didn't have access to universal newborn hearing screening. Moreover, SNHL might develop later as the outcome of their AD or their treatment. Suggestion about more late amplification in children with SNHL was confirmed. The cause might be wary relation of audiologists to amplification of children with AD and difficulties of this process.Исследовалась структура комплексных нарушений у детей с разной степенью сенсоневральной тугоухости (СНТ), а также влияние дополнительной патологии на возраст диагностики нарушения слуха и слухопротезирования ребенка. Показано, что 41% детей с СНТ имеют различные дополнительные нарушения: центральной нервной системы, зрения, опорно-двигательного аппарата, сердечно-сосудистой, дыхательной, мочевыделительной, пищеварительной, эндокринной систем и др. 59% детей с комплексными нарушениями имеют 2—3 дополнительных заболевания помимо тугоухости. Наиболее часто встречается сочетание патологии ЦНС и двигательных нарушений. У детей с комплексными нарушениями генетический фактор тугоухости встречался значительно реже по сравнению с детьми с изолированной тугоухостью. У детей с дополнительной патологией диагностика нарушения слуха в возрасте до 4 мес производится значительно реже, что можно объяснить тем, что в первые месяцы жизни многие из этих детей пребывают в отделениях интенсивной терапии, где не всегда проводят аудиологический скрининг, а также тем, что, возможно, нарушение слуха у них развивается позднее — на фоне лечения соматических заболеваний. Подтверждено предположение о более позднем возрасте слухопротезирования детей с комплексными нарушениями, что связано с осторожным отношением врачей-сурдологов к слухопротезированию у таких детей и с трудностями этого процесса.",

Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is the most severe of the generalized types and exhibits major neocortical migration defects, less severe and non-inflammatory white matter lesions, and dysmorphic features. In adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) the major lesion again is in the CNS, but consists of extensive dysmyelination/inflammatory demyelination without neuronal migration defects or dysmorphism. In adrenomyeloneuropathy long tract degeneration of spinal cord, peripheral neuropathy, and variable CNS dysmyelinative to inflammatory demyelinative lesions are the dominant nervous system lesions. Saturated very long chain fatty acids, either free in the cytoplasm of affected endocrine cells or as components of membrane lipids (e.g. gangliosides, glycerophospholipids, and proteolipid protein) in axons or myelin, may be central to the pathogenesis of these neuronal migration defects, dysmyelination/inflammatory demyelination and spinal tract degeneration.

      "abstract": "The mechanism for maintaining balance in man is complex. Vision, proprioception, and vestibular inputs are integrated in the central nervous system, and modulated by activity from the cerebellum, the extrapyramidal system, the reticular formation, and the cortex. This integrated, modulated information provides one mechanism for control of oculomotor activity, controls posture, gait, and motor skills and allows perception of the head and body in space. Recent evidence also supports an effect upon autonomic function, cognition, and emotion. The complexity of the system is such that pathology in a variety of different bodily systems, including the endocrine system, the cardiovascular system, and the haemopoietic system, can impact upon vestibular activity, in addition to primary otological and neurological pathology. Patients with dysfunction in the vestibular end-organs or vestibular pathways commonly complain of symptoms of dizziness, vertigo, unsteadiness, light-headedness, imbalance, and a plethora of synonyms associated with a sense of instability. Not infrequently, in an attempt to define their ‘unphysiological’ experience, patients use rather vague and imprecise semantics. The clinical distinction between dizziness, a symptom of non-specific pathological significance, and vertigo, a hallucination or illusion of movement, is rarely made, although the latter is a cardinal manifestation of a disorder of the vestibular system (Dix 1973). Ten to 20 per cent of all ‘dizzy’ patients are reportedly seen in neurology clinics (Dieterish 2004), therefore it behoves the neurologist to have a clear diagnostic strategy, including knowledge of detailed neuro-otological examination, to enable appropriate diagnosis and management of the patient with vestibular symptoms.",

Neurologic, psychiatric, cognitive and functional assessments are completed by the neuropsychiatric nurse to obtain an accurate picture of the behavioral problem. Nursing interventions are then developed to improve functional ability and promote independence. If a neuropsychiatric nurse is not available many of these assessment skills can be employed by neuroscience nurses and implemented on neurological and neurosurgical units.",

The interview should ensure that the child's elevated mood or irritability is not accounted for by other disorders such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or substance use disorder. If the parent endorsed a Major Depressive Episode, the interviewer should inquire whether these symptoms occurred during the same 2-week period. If criteria are met for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. If the child's symptoms do not meet the full criteria for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, NOS. These children may have typical bipolar symptoms but not the DSM-5 required duration. In addition, these children may be characterized by severe irritability, aggressiveness, agitation, and/or mood lability. There may also be more rapid cycling of mood.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical phenomena or behavior that develop during the sleep period. These abnormal events or experiences are not principally abnormalities of the states of sleep and wakefulness, and they are not generally associated with major complaints of excessive sleepiness or insomnia. Parasomnias can manifest as activation of skeletal muscles or the autonomic nervous system during sleep. They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness. Occasionally, parasomnias may give rise to violent and potentially injurious behavior. Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1. Disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors 2. Parasomnias usually associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, including REM sleep behavior disorder (including parasomnia overlap disorder and status dissociatus), recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorder 3. Other parasomnias, including sleep-related dissociative disorder, sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning (catathrenia), exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the mental decline and dementia of patients suffering from brain disorders. The most common of these neurological illnesses is Alzheimer’s disease, characterized by a progressive atrophy of cortical brain areas. Alzheimer’s disease accounts by far for the largest part of all dementias and is presently one of the most serious disorders, causing an immense burden on patients and society. Vascular dementia is noticed when the brain’s supply of blood is disrupted by strokes or other vessel pathologies and just as in Alzheimer’s this leads to cortical atrophy with almost identical symptoms. Since the distinction between Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia is a gradual one, mixed pathologies are rather common. Rarer causes of dementia are frontotemporal dementia, with pathologies mainly in frontal and temporal brain regions, Parkinson’s disease with atrophy in basal ganglia which leads to motor disturbances and at times to mental decline, Lewy body dementia caused by abnormal deposits in the brain resulting in considerable damages of neural cells, and Huntington’s disease, a genetic disorder with widely dispersed brain atrophy characterized by mixed Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s symptoms. Presently, for the most part the cease of the progressive course of all these disorders is not possible. The last two disorders mentioned in this paper are normal pressure hydrocephalus, with a reduced absorption of ventricular fluid, and Korsakoff’s syndrome, caused by a deficiency of vitamin B1. In normal pressure hydrocephalus a brain shunt may reverse the pathological symptoms, while a vitamin B1 diet could improve the symptoms of Korsakoff’s syndrome. Diagnosis, symptoms and pathologies of all disorders are presented in this paper.",

      "title": "Health Effects of Sleep Deprivation",
      "abstract": "Electrical lighting and increasing capital intensiveness have helped undermine the importance that society previously placed on obtaining adequate sleep. Even modest amounts of daily sleep loss accumulate as “sleep debt.” Sleep debt manifests in a myriad of ways, the most common being an increasing tendency to fall asleep, increased risk of accidental injury, impaired mood, and reduced psychomotor performance. Sleep debt can have far reaching consequences, both to an individual in terms of increased cardiovascular risk and to society at large, because of sleepiness-related fatigue and errors. Sleep specialists need to further their understanding of the physiologic and behavioral consequences of total, partial, and selective sleep stage deprivation, because they affect many organ systems. Studies of selective sleep stage deprivation also provide insights into the function of sleep. Evaluating the effects of sleep deprivation must take into account the following factors: (1) the duration of prior sleep, (2) circadian time frame, (3) arousal influences, and (4) subject and test characteristics. Sleep deprivation has been extensively studied in the acute experimental setting. Under extreme conditions, sleep deprivation is associated with mortality in laboratory animals. In the natural human environment, the behavioral consequence of chronic sleep debt in shift work intolerance is well described. The link between electrophysiological sleep disturbance and pathogenesis of disease is less well understood in both acute and chronic states. Additional investigation into the relationship between sleep deprivation and disease mechanisms, such as impaired glucose tolerance, hormonal dysregulation, and cytokine imbalance, will enhance our comprehension of this link.",

      "title": "DIAGNOSIS OF FIBROMYALGIA IN HEALTH PRACTICE",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic non inﬂammatory, non-autoimmune central aﬀerent processing disorder leading to a diﬀuse pain syndrome. It aﬀects individuals of diﬀerent age groups, sex and sociocultural background. It is estimated to aﬀect 2-5% of western population. The symptoms include widespread pain, fatigue, stiﬀness and sleep disturbance, cognitive problems and mood disorders (anxiety, depression or both) 1. The etiology of Fibromyalgia (FM) is unknown; however several factors may contribute to development as well as severity of symptoms of FM. Genetic polymorphisms have been reported in serotonin transporter and receptors, as well as in dopamine, beta2 adrenergic and glutamate receptor genes. 2 Middle aged women and young are more aﬀected. Sleep abnormalities, autonomic dysregulation, and psychological variables like perfectionist personality, negative beliefs, low self-esteem, depression and anxiety are the contributory factors.3 Physical examination and pathological investigations reveal no evidence of articular, osseous or soft tissue inﬂammation or degeneration. Patients may have tender points both above and below the waist. The previously followed criteria, depending on presence of tender points, are no more followed. In 2010, a new diagnostic criterion was adopted by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 4. It has three points: - 1. Widespread pain index (WPI)&gt;7 &amp; a symptom severity (SS) score &gt;5 or widespread pain index 3-6 &amp; (SS) score &gt;9. 2. Symptoms present for at least 3.No other disorder to explain In diﬀerential diagnosis, many diseases need to be ruled out making the diagnosis of FM. These are systemic lupus erythematosis, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteomalacia, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic hypothyroidism, chronic hepatitis, HIV, hemo- chromatosis, celiac disease, myasthenia gravis, hyperthyroidism, myopathies, Sjogren`s, adrenal insufficiency, lymphoma and chronic fatigue syndrome.5 Although the exact pathophysiology of FM is unknown, most of the researchers believe that the pathophysiology of FM is due to the central sensitization within the CNS, manifesting as amplified pain perception. The specific abnormalities that have been observed in the aﬀerent pain procession areas of the CNS in FM patients, who exhibit the following symptoms: increased excitability of dorsal horn nuclei due to abnormal windup; increased levels of substance P, nerve growth factor, glutamate and aspartate measured in CSF of patients with FM 6expanded receptive fields for central pain perception (central sensitization); MRI shows expanded fields in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex and somatosensory area.7 The abnormalities within the descending analgesia system are also observed i.e decreased levels of pain inhibitory neurotransmitters including nor epinephrine, serotonin, dopamine and suppression of normal activity of dopamine releasing neurons in limbic system.1 The management of FM is very challenging. It has many components i.e patient education, physical exercises, analgesia, treatment of associated condition like anxiety, depression, and mood disorders. Counseling about the disease and CBT are also helpful. Medication approved for the treatment of FM are: Serotonin-noreprenphine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); Duloxetine ,venlaxafine, Milnacipran. Anticonvulsants; Pregabalin. Tri cyclic antidepressants: Amitriptyline, imipramine. Analgesia; Tramadol. Paracetamol and NSAIDS are not aﬀective for analgesia.8,9 The diagnosis of FM is quiet challenging in the developed world with good evaluation and referral system. In underdeveloped country with poor medical education and no referral system FM patients are the mostly go un-diagnosed and hence are under treated. It is high time to highlight the importance of diagnosis of FM by the general practitioner and other specialties doctors for proper management of these patients. The disease impact of FM is not less than any other chronic inﬂammatory disease like Rheumatoid Arthritis. On an average the FM patients visit doctor 3-4 times more often than the general population (17 versus 4 visits/year). The frequent visits of patients with FM, is one of the factors of increasing burden on health system as well as having socio-economic impact on patients.",

      "abstract": "Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by predominant visual deficits due to its atrophy of the occipital lobes. Patients typically have preserved cognitive function during the early stages, making diagnosis more difficult when compared to other neurocognitive disorders. In this case, the patient presented predominantly with mood symptoms, delusions, and visual hallucinations. The disease course began 5 years ago with anxiety and insomnia. It developed into depressive symptoms including two suicide attempts (SAs), paranoia, and hallucinations. The diagnosis was eventually reached utilizing a thorough clinical exam, neuropsychological testing, MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), and dopamine transporter (DAT) scans. We conclude that mood or psychotic symptoms that emerge, escalate, or change dramatically at later ages merit further workup to evaluate for underlying neurodegenerative disorders.",

In the differential diagnosis, cerebrovascular disease that can lead to cognitive impairment must also be differentiated from endogenous depressive disorder or language impairment. Objectives The aim is to highlight the importance of differential diagnosis in cognitive disorders in relation to a case. Methods A 68-year-old female patient attended a psychiatric consultation derived from neurology when presenting a language disorder. The husband who accompanies her and the patient indicate that she has problems finding words and substitutes other expressions for them or sometimes does not answer or does so with something different from the topic that is being asked. She refers that she presents repetitive language with memory problems, alteration in the evocation of memories. The patient reports mood swings and irritability and crying with a low tolerance for frustration since she cannot express herself. Cranial MRI: cortical and central involutional changes. Periventricular leukoaraiosis and ischemic gliosis-like lesions in the white matter of both hemispheres. Psychopathological exploration: Conscious, oriented. She smiles at the questions but doesn’t answer them. Repetitive language. Alteration in the articulation of language. Depressed mood reactive to current situation. Some irritability Alteration in recent memory and evocation. Results She was diagnosed with organic mental disorder compatible with mild cognitive impairment. Treatment with rehabilitation of the language disorder of vascular etiology is established. Conclusions Imaging and neuropsychological tests should always be performed in a patient with language, memory, and mood disorders to study its etiology. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Such developmental deviation is likely to be accompanied by certain psychic and pathologic disturbances. Mental deficiency, perhaps thyrogenous, in an infant under 10 months of age, is usually betrayed by such signs and symptoms as lack of the sucking reflex, delayed aptitude for holding the head erect, fixing the eyes, recognizing parents and relatives, grasping and playing with objects, turning over, sitting unaided and standing with aid. Subsequently, the most reliable evidences of mental development will depend on the as similation of language, walking, control of the sphincters, school progress and mental tests. It should be added here that results of the latter are by no means absolute, much being contingent on personal interpretation and ruling out of all possible misleading factors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D) are Lewy body-related neurodegenerative disorders sharing common clinical and neuropathological findings. The clinical features of both conditions include cognitive impairment, behavioral symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, and parkinsonism. The cognitive profile of both disorders is characterized by particularly severe deficits in executive and visuospatial functions as well as attention. Clinical differentiation between DLB and PD-D is based on an arbitrary distinction between the time of onset of parkinsonism and cognitive symptoms; extrapyramidal symptoms precede dementia in PD-D, whereas it coincides with or follows dementia within 1 year in DLB. When the clinical picture is fully developed, DLB and PD-D are practically indistinguishable. Although the diagnosis is basically clinical, structural and functional neuroimaging as well as cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers may help the clinician in the diagnosis. Placebo-controlled randomized trials of the cholinesterase inhibitors have shown modest but significant benefits in cognition, global function, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in both disorders. Behavioral symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions should be treated with caution with antipsychotics, as they have the potential to worsen motor and cognitive symptoms.",

      "title": "Childhood Hypersomnia and Sleep Apnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Natural sleep pattern and its physiology in childhood are much different from those in adulthood. Several aspects of clinical evaluation for sleepiness in childhood are more difficult than in adulthood. These difficulties are due to several factors. First, excessive sleepiness in childhood do not always develop functional impairments. Second, objective test such as MSLT may not be reliable since it is hard to be certain that the child understand instructions. Third, sleepiness in children is often obscured by irritability. paradoxical hyperactivity, or behavioral disturbances. Anseguently, careful clinical evaluation is needed for the sleepy children. Usual causes of sleepiness in children are the disorders that induce insufficient sleep such as sleep apnea syndrome, schedule disorder, underlying medical and psychiatric disorder, and so forth. After excluding such factors, we can diagnose the hypersomnic disorders such as narcolepsy, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and idiopathic central nervous system hypersomnia. Among the variety of those causes of sleepiness, I reviewed the clinical difference of narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in childhood compared with in adulthood. Recognition of the childhood narcolepsy is difficult because even severely sleepy children often do not develop pathognomic cataplexy and associated REM phenomena until much later. Since childhood narcolepsy give srise to many psychological, academical problem. Practicers should be concerned about these aspects. Childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is different from adult obstructive sleep apnea syndrome too. Several aspects such as pathophysiology. clinical feature, diagnostic criteria, complication, management, and prognosis differ from those in the adult syndrome. An important feature of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is the variety of severe complications such as behavioral disorders, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular symptoms, developmental delay, and ever death. Fortunately, surgical interventions like adenotosillectomy or UPPP are more effective for Childhood OSA than adult form. CPAP is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated treatment modality too. So if early detection and proper management of childhood OSA were done, the severe complication would be prevented or ever cured.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

The clinical picture of a patient with idiopathic longitudinally advanced transverse myelitis is often dramatic and may consist of paraparesis or tetraparesis, sensory disturbances, and pelvic dysfunction. Idiopathic longitudinally advanced transverse myelitis is a common manifestation of the neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, but can also occur in various other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases of the CNS, such as multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, or Sjogrens syndrome, or in infectious diseases involving the CNS. It is less likely to occur in isolation, as the only manifestation of a demyelinating disease of the nervous system of an unknown etiology (idiopathic myelitis).&#x0D; Clinical case description: The clinical observation presented in the article demonstrates the difficulties of establishing a nosological diagnosis in the case of a monophasic course of TM in the absence of other autoimmune and infectious diseases of the central nervous system. The patient with idiopathic longitudinally distributed TM had no visual disturbances and no antibodies to aquaporin 4 and to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-IgG) with twice repeated tests.&#x0D; Conclusion: In this regard, it is important to dynamically monitor the clinical manifestations and MRI signs in patients with an isolated lesion of a demyelinating nature in the form of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis.",

      "title": "Autonomic Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) results not only in motor and sensory deficits but also in autonomic dysfunctions. The disruption of connections between higher brain centers and the spinal cord, or the impaired autonomic nervous system itself, manifests a broad range of autonomic abnormalities. This includes compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, thermoregulatory, and sexual activities. These disabilities evoke potentially life-threatening symptoms that severely interfere with the daily living of those with SCI. In particular, high thoracic or cervical SCI often causes disordered hemodynamics due to deregulated sympathetic outflow. Episodic hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia develops as a result of massive sympathetic discharge often triggered by unpleasant visceral or sensory stimuli below the injury level. In the pelvic floor, bladder and urethral dysfunctions are classified according to upper motor neuron versus lower motor neuron injuries; this is dependent on the level of lesion. Most impairments of the lower urinary tract manifest in two interrelated complications: bladder storage and emptying. Inadequate or excessive detrusor and sphincter functions as well as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia are examples of micturition abnormalities stemming from SCI. Gastrointestinal motility disorders in spinal cord injured-individuals are comprised of gastric dilation, delayed gastric emptying, and diminished propulsive transit along the entire gastrointestinal tract. As a critical consequence of SCI, neurogenic bowel dysfunction exhibits constipation and/or incontinence. Thus, it is essential to recognize neural mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying various complications of autonomic dysfunctions after SCI. This overview provides both vital information for better understanding these disorders and guides to pursue novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate secondary complications. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

      "title": "Critical Care Neurology Perspective on Delirium",
      "abstract": "The evidence linking delirium to poor outcomes after critical illness is compelling, including higher mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer length of intensive care unit stay, and long-term cognitive impairments. The attitude toward delirium in the neurologic community is shifting away from viewing it as an unmodifiable, inevitable consequence of severe illness to treating it is as a neurologic emergency, akin to seizures or encephalitis. Delirium, like other manifestations of critical illness encephalopathy, is an organ dysfunction syndrome. Given the brain's central role in maintaining homeostasis, brain failure may dysregulate many downstream functions of significant consequence in critically ill patients. The diagnosis of delirium may be confounded in patients with primary brain disorders, but nevertheless delirium symptoms in the neurologic population are also independently associated with worse outcomes. There is scant evidence for directed pharmacological treatment of delirium, but multicomponent care bundles that address the management of pain, agitation, sedation, and delirium are effective at reducing the burden of delirium in the general intensive care unit population. The management of delirium in the neurologic intensive care environment is mostly extrapolated from studies on general medical critical illness and noncritically ill neurologic patients. Further investigation into the unique risks and management needs of critically ill neurologic and neurosurgical patients is needed to reduce the burden of delirium in that population.",

      "title": "Parkinson's disease: drug-induced psychiatric states.",
      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric states occur frequently in PD. In the prelevodopa era, depression and other psychiatric disorders were described in PD, but in untreated patients psychosis was rare. Since the development of levodopa and other pharmacological treatments for PD, however, psychotic symptoms have become much more common (10-50%). In some individuals these problems can be more disabling than the motor features of PD and, as a result, pose a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence. The drug-induced psychoses consist of several distinct psychiatric syndromes that can be divided broadly into those occurring on a background of a clear sensorium and those which are accompanied by confusion and clouding of consciousness. Benign organic hallucinosis is the most common of these syndromes (30%). It usually occurs on a background of a clear sensorium and may not be a particularly troublesome problem if the patient is able to retain insight into the nature of these symptoms. More disabling syndromes usually include delusional thinking that is frequently paranoid, confusion and even frank delirium. Although all these psychotic syndromes can occur in isolation, there is a tendency for mild symptoms to progress to more disabling ones if adequate and timely treatment is not instituted. Abnormal dreaming and sleep disruption often precede these difficulties by weeks to months and may provide an important early clue to their onset. The mechanisms responsible for drug-induced psychotic symptoms in PD are unknown, but dopaminergic (especially mesolimbic) and serotoninergic systems are likely to be involved. The treatment of the drug-induced psychoses in PD should be undertaken in a stepwise manner. A detailed discussion of this approach, including the use of anti-PD medication adjustment, clozapine, and other medications (neuroleptic and nonneuroleptic) and ECT is provided (see Fig. 1). Although drug-induced psychoses are the most important of the drug-induced psychiatric states, mania, anxiety, and hypersexuality may also occur. Depression is also common in PD, but it is unlikely to occur as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medications.",

However, some patients may lack typical signs suggesting a vestibular or cerebellar lesion and they mostly complain of vertigo or posture imbalance induced by visual stimulation. The symptoms immediately improve either on cessation of the visual input or upon closure of the eyes. Such a presentation is typical of visual vertigo.From 1993 to 2003, 242 patients were examined for either \"vertigo\" or \"dizziness\". The diagnosis of visual vertigo was based on both history and clinical examination and was present in 11 patients.Visual vertigo was diagnosed in 11/242 patients (4.5 %). Age range was 31 - 77 years (mean 47 years) with a sex ratio of 8 females for 3 males. Neuro-ophthalmological examination was normal in all cases.Visual vertigo is not a rare condition but the disease is underdiagnosed. The symptoms result from a mismatch between vestibular, proprioceptive and visual inputs. Neuro-ophthalmological, neurological and neuro-otological examination are often normal or not relevant and the diagnosis is largely based on history. It is important to recognize this entity because the symptoms might improve if the patients are treated with psycho-motor rehabilitation.",

Approximately half of individuals diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis complex present with global intellectual impairment and developmental psychopathologies. Those with normal intellectual abilities are also at high risk of specific neuropsychologic deficits and behavioral, learning, and other psychiatric disorders. There is no evidence for an inevitable decline in cognition or behavior, and any such changes should be investigated.

      "abstract": "Movement disorder emergencies can occur either de novo or as an acute worsening of a preexisting movement disorder. Movement disorder emergency can have varied manifestations like rigidity, stiffness, dystonia, psychosis, hyperkinetic, or hypokinetic disorders. These usually have a treatable cause. Knowledge of drug interactions and eliciting a detailed drug history is important. Early recognition based on phenomenology and syndromic approach and quick intervention leads to complete recovery with minimal morbidity/mortality. Treatment is a three-pronged approach, viz., patient stabilization and airway protection, treating the movement disorder and associated complications like rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia, and then treating the disease-specific etiology.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in the world. Both type 1 (insulin‐dependent) and type 2 diabetes are commonly complicated by peripheral nerve disorders. Two main types of neuropathy are observed: the most common is a nerve fibre length dependent, distal symmetrical sensory polyneuropathy with little motor involvement but frequent, and potentially life threatening, autonomic dysfunction. Alteration of temperature and pain sensations in the feet is an early manifestation of diabetic polyneuropathy. The second pattern is a focal neuropathy which more commonly complicates or reveal type 2 diabetes. Poor diabetic control increases the risk of neuropathy with subsequent neuropathic pains and trophic changes in the feet, which can be prevented by patient's education. Key Concepts: Length‐dependent diabetic polyneuropathy is the most common neuropathy in the world. Neuropathic pains are the most common symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Charcot joints and plantar ulcers are favored by loss of pain sensation. Autonomic dysfunction is commonly associated with small fibre diabetic neuropathy. The prevalence of diabetic polyneuropathy increases with duration and poor diabetic control. Focal neuropathies are more common in type 2 diabetic patient.",

The polyneuropathic syndrome consists of typical symptoms like paraesthesias, pain, cramps and fasciculations as well as characteristic signs like loss of tendon reflexes, weakness and wasting of muscles, sensory loss, cranial nerve palsy and alterations of the autonomic nervous system. The analysis of manifestation-types is very important for the differential diagnosis. The symmetrical sensory type of manifestation can be found in the beginning of almost all toxic neuropathies as well as in uremic and diabetic neuropathy. The symmetrical-motor type of manifestation can be a further development of the symmetrical sensory type of manifestation or exists from the beginning in the case for example of Guillain-Barré-Syndrome. The asymmetric type of manifestation can be observed in the vascular neuropathies and in some types of inflammatory neuropathies like the neuroborrelioses or the neuralgic amyotrophy. The investigation of the CSF, electromyography and electroneurography as well as a great number of chemical lab tests are important for the etiological classification. According to the etiology, the polyneuropathies can be subdivided into four groups such as inflammatory, vascular, exotoxic and endotoxic-metabolic-hereditary diseases. The most frequent etiologies are diabetes mellitus and chronic alcoholism.",

Non-convulsive seizures represent states of various levels of altered awareness, associated with electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure activity, but without outwardly observable convulsive activity2. An important feature of convulsive seizures is their potential for evolution into non-convulsive seizures, where the patient can appear “post ictal” but is having electrical seizures, without obvious convulsive activity3. Other types of status epilepticus include simple partial status (with preserved awareness), complex partial status (with impaired consciousness) and myoclonic status (often associated with coma)4.\r\n\r\nRecords from antiquity describe SE, but it has only been in the last century that there have been major advances in its understanding and treatment5. Many significant questions remain about the pathophysiology and management of this medical emergency which carries a substantial morbidity and mortality.

      "abstract": "Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy (DPHL) is a demyelinating syndrome characterized by acute onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms days to weeks following apparent recovery from coma after a period of prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation. It is diagnosed, after excluding other potential causes of delirium, with a clinical history of carbon monoxide poisoning, narcotic overdose, myocardial infarction, or another global cerebral hypoxic event. The diagnosis can be supported by neuroimaging evidence of diffuse hemispheric demyelination sparing cerebellar and brainstem tracts, or by an elevated cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein. Standard or hyperbaric oxygen following CO poisoning may reduce the likelihood of DPHL or other neurologic sequelae. Bed rest and avoidance of stressful procedures for the first 10 days following any prolonged hypoxic event may also lower the risk. Gradual recovery over a 3 to 12 month period is common, but impaired attention or executive function, parkinsonism, or corticospinal tract signs can persist. Stimulants, amantadine or levodopa may be considered for lasting cognitive or parkinsonian symptoms. Anticipation and recognition of DPHL should lead to earlier and more appropriate utilization of health care services.",

      "abstract": "Mental dysfunction including cognitive, behavioural changes, mood disorders, and psychosis are increasingly recognized in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders. Their morphological correlates are complex due to multiple system degeneration. CNS changes contributing to cognitive changes in PD include 1. Dysfunction of subcortico-cortical networks with neuron losses in a) the dopaminergic nigrostriatal loop causing striato-(pre)frontal deafferentation and mesocortico-limbic system (medial substantia nigra, ventral tegmentum); b) noradrenergic (locus coer-uleus), and serotonergic systems (dorsal raphe nuclei), c) cholinergic fore-brain system (nucleus basalis of Meynert, etc), and d) specific nuclei of amygdala and limbic system (thalamic nuclei, hippocampus); 2. Limbic and/or cortical Lewy body and Alzheimer type pathologies with loss of neurons and synapses, 3. Combination of subcortical, cortical, and other pathologies. In general, degeneration of subcortical and striato-frontal networks causes cognitive, executive, behavioural, and mood disorders but less severe dementia than cortical changes which, when present in sufficient numbers, are important factors for overt dementia. In PD, cortical tau pathology with similar or differential patterns than in Alzheimer disease (AD) shows significant linear correlation with cognitive decline. In dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the second most frequent cause of dementia in the elderly, cortical Lewy bodies (LB) may or may not be associated with amyloid plaques and neuritic AD lesions. They predominantly affect the limbic system with less frequent isocortical Braak stages, whereas the cholinergic forebrain system is more severely affected than in AD. Both neuritic degeneration in limbic system in PD and DLB and the density of cortical synapse markers correlate with neuritic AD pathology and less with cortical LB counts. Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele frequency may represent a common genetic background for both AD and LB pathologies but there are different proportions of plaques between DLB (less Aβ1–40) and AD (more frequent Aβ1–40). Familial parkinsonism with dementia, linked to chromosome 17 (frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism (FTDP-17), and other tauo-pathies pathologically resembling PD plus AD, are often related to mutations of the tau gene, whereas familial PD with α-synuclein and Parkin mutations usually show no cognitive impairment. Mood disorders, in particular depression, and psychotic complications in both PD and DLB are related to complex involvement of noradregergic and serotonergic systems, not comfirmed in AD with depression, and both the prefrontal and limbic dopaminergic systems. The specific contributions of cortical and subcortical pathologies to mental dysfunction in PD and related disorders, their relationship to AD, and their genetic and aetiological backgrounds await further elucidation.",

      "abstract": "We discuss comorbidity, continuity, and discontinuity of anxiety-related disorders from the perspective of a two-dimensional neuropsychology of fear (threat avoidance) and anxiety (threat approach). Pharmacological dissection of the \"neurotic\" disorders justifies both a categorical division between fear and anxiety and a subdivision of each mapped to a hierarchy of neural modules that process different immediacies of threat. It is critical that each module can generate normal responses, symptoms of another syndrome, or syndromal responses. We discuss the resultant possibilities for comorbid dysfunction of these modules both with each other and with some disorders not usually classified as anxiety related. The simplest case is symptomatic fear/anxiety comorbidity, where dysfunction in one module results in excess activity in a second, otherwise normal, module to generate symptoms and apparent comorbidity. More complex is syndromal fear/anxiety comorbidity, where more than one module is concurrently dysfunctional. Yet more complex are syndromal comorbidities of anxiety that go beyond the two dimensional fear/anxiety systems: depression, substance use disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Our account of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-anxiety comorbidity entails discussion of the neuropsychology of externalizing disorders to account for the lack of anxiety comorbidity in some of these. Finally, we link the neuropsychology of disorder to personality variation, and to the development of a biomarker of variation in the anxiety system among individuals that, if extreme, may provide a means of unambiguously identifying the first of a range of anxiety syndromes.",

This failure to show visual behavior is seen in the first few weeks and months of life. The etiology of DVM remains obscure. In a most recent careful follow-up study, so-called isolated DVM was associated with minor neurologic abnormalities. This association implies that there may be some underlying neurologic defect that causes DVM, but whether DVM is due to a delay in sensory development or a delay in motor fixation is unknown. Optic nerve hypoplasia, atrophy, and coloboma have all been reported in children exposed to cocaine in utero. Optic nerve hypoplasia is a condition in which the optic nerves fail to develop a normal number of axons. The most common abnormality after in utero cocaine exposure is the development of periorbital edema.",

Mean sleep latency was significantly correlated (P < .05) to alertness functions. Eight patients displayed behavioral problems: emotional symptoms and conduct problems prevailed. Childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy represents a risk factor for subtle and heterogeneous cognitive impairments potentially resulting in academic failure, despite the normal IQ.

Studies of sleep parameters revealed early hypofunction of brainstem aminergic neurons and late occurrence of hypofunction of dopaminergic neurons, followed by receptor supersensitivity. The syndrome's pathophysiology suggests that early hypofunction of aminergic neurons interferes with the development of higher neuronal systems.

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnia in which the normal muscle atonia of REM sleep is absent. The lack of muscle atonia may lead to motor activation and the appearance of dream-related behaviors. Dream content during RBD is vivid and often has aggressive themes, such as being threatened, chased, or attacked. During an episode, both the patient with RBD and their bed partner are at risk for serious injuries (e.g., bruises, lacerations, and bone fractures). Diagnosis of RBD currently requires the presence of established clinical criteria, but polysomnography is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate it from other sleep disorders, including sleep apnea. Controlled trials are lacking; yet, clonazepam has been effective in treating symptoms in up to 90% of patients with RBD. Other treatment approaches are dopaminergic agonists, antiepileptic agents, α-adrenergic agonists, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and melatonin. RBD is frequently associated with synucleinopathies, such as multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson's disease. In these patients, RBD symptoms may precede motor symptoms by months to years. Abnormalities in central dopaminergic mechanisms have been postulated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Legius syndrome, initially reported as neurofibromatosis type 1‐like syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by heterozygous inactivating SPRED1 mutations. The disease is characterised by multiple café‐au‐lait spots (CALs), sometimes associated with axillary or inguinal freckling and macrocephaly as seen in neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ). Other typical NF1 associated features (Lisch nodules, bone abnormalities, neurofibromas, optic pathway gliomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours) are lacking. Some degree of learning disability and/or speech problems in infancy are frequently observed and are usually milder than in NF1 . The SPRED1 protein is a negative regulator of the RAS (rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog)‐MAPK ( mitogen‐activated protein kinase ) pathway. CALs in Legius syndrome result from bi‐allelic SPRED1 inactivation in melanocytes. SPRED1 loss‐of‐function results in overactivation of the RAS‐MAPK signalling pathway. This is similar to what is seen in a group of disorders caused by mutations in other genes coding for key proteins of the RAS‐MAPK pathway (referred as RASopathies). Key Concepts: Legius syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. It is caused by heterozygous mutations in the SPRED1 gene. The phenotype consists of café‐au‐lait spots, sometimes with axillary or inguinal freckling and a variable degree of macrocephaly. Learning disabilities and speech problems in infants are frequently reported. SPRED1 is a negative regulator of the RAS‐MAPK pathway at the level of activation of RAF by RAS‐GTP. Legius syndrome is a RASopathy (RAS‐MAPK syndrome).",

      "abstract": "An epileptic syndrome of benign nocturnal childhood occipital epilepsy with excellent prognosis is described. The syndrome is characterized by a clinical ictal triad of nocturnal seizures, tonic deviation of the eyes, and vomiting. There may be marching to involve the head and limbs, ending with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Consciousness is usually, but not invariably, disturbed. Infrequent daytime fits may develop one to two years after remission of the nocturnal seizures. Age of onset is usually from 3 to 5 years. Both sexes are involved. There is no family history of epilepsy or migraine. No definite causative factor was detected. The frequency of the seizures is very low with two children having only solitary ones. The interictal electroencephalographic features consist of repetitive occipital spike and slow wave complexes that are induced by closed eyes and darkness and are inhibited by open eyes and fixation with visual cues. It is proposed that this is a new idiopathic age-related-onset syndrome of the localization-related epilepsies. (J Child Neurol 1989;4:43-48).",

      "title": "Analytical study of 100 cases of traumatic optic neuropathy",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Traumatic optic neuropathy is a devastating potential\r\ncomplication of closed head injury. The hallmark of an optic\r\nneuropathy, traumatic loss of visual function, which can manifest by\r\nsubnormal visual acuity, visual field loss, or colour vision dysfunction.\r\nThe presence of an afferent pupillary defect strongly suggests a\r\nprechiasmal location for the injury and is necessary to validate the\r\ndiagnosis of traumatic optic neuropathy. Vision loss associated with\r\ntraumatic optic neuropathy can be partial or complete and temporary or\r\npermanent.\r\nApproximately 1.5% to 5% of patients with closed head injuries\r\nhave damage to visual pathways (4-6 / 100,000 general population / yr).\r\nThese injuries can be divided into anterior and posterior lesions.\r\nAnterior lesions shows ophthalmoscopic abnormalities (eg. Central\r\nretinal artery occlusion) and usually associated with a variety of easily\r\nrecognized injuries to the globe. Anterior lesions may include optic\r\nnerve avulsion, traumatic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, anterior\r\noptic nerve sheath hematoma. Posterior lesions are free of\r\nophthalmoscopic findings, but disc edema and disc pallor do occur.\r\nPosterior traumatic optic neuropathy is characterised by visual loss that\r\noccur in the presence of an afferent pupillary defect but without\r\nevidence of injury to the eye or optic nerve.\r\nAIM AND OBJECTIVES:\r\nTo analyse the clinical profile, response to mega dose steroid\r\ntherapy and visual function outcome in patients with traumatic optic\r\nneuropathy presenting to the neuroophthalmology clinic at Regional\r\nInstitute of Ophthalmology and Government Ophthalmic Hospital, Chennai.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational case study on the pattern of traumatic\r\noptic neuropathy and analysis of clinical profile, response to treatment\r\nand visual function outcome was conducted in the department of\r\nneuroophthalmology at RIO-GOH, Chennai.\r\nThe study was conducted from June 2008 to November 2010. All\r\neligible traumatic optic neuropathy patients according to inclusion\r\ncriteria, presented to the neuroophthalmology clinic at RIO-GOH during\r\nJune 2008 to may 2010 were included in the study.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nHippocrates might have been the first to identify the phenomenon\r\nof acute and delayed vision loss after injuries placed to and slightly\r\nabove the brow. While there is little controversy on the macroscopic\r\nmechanism of trauma theory, multiple hypothesis have been proposed at\r\nmicroscopic level of damage to the optic nerve including contusion\r\nnecrosis, nerve fibre tears and nerve infarction secondary to closed\r\nspace edema, haemorrhage, thrombosis, vasospasm, impingement by\r\nbone spicules and shearing of dural vessels in the optic canal.\r\nIn our study it is evident that traumatic optic neuropathy is\r\ndevastating cause of permanent visual loss. Concussive force to head\r\nespecially forehead transmits shock wave to optic canal. Visual loss is\r\nusually instantaneous.\r\nSUMMARY: Traumatic optic neuropathy is a rare but significant cause of post\r\ntraumatic visual loss. The responsible blunt trauma to the frontal region\r\nmay be minor or severe and accompanied by multiple adjacent fractures.\r\nCareful documentation of visual acuity, pupillary function, and red\r\ndesaturation is essential to guide management. CT imaging should be\r\nperformed to document such structural abnormalities as optic nerve\r\navulsion, optic nerve sheath hematoma, orbital hematoma, or optic canal\r\nfracture with fragments.\r\nBased on the data from the International Optic Nerve Trauma\r\nStudy, observation without intervention is a viable option. Patients and\r\ntheir families should be made aware of the information regarding mega\r\ndose corticosteroid therapy and participate in an informed decision. In\r\nparticular, if visual acuity begins to deteriorate, then corticosteroid\r\ntherapy should be considered. If a structural abnormality is present that\r\nmay be contributing to optic nerve dysfunction (hematoma or fragment)\r\nor if the patient’s visual acuity deteriorates on corticosteroids, optic\r\ncanal decompression should be offered. Management of this disorder\r\nremains very controversial; involvement of other appropriate\r\nsubspecialists and careful discussions with the patient and family are\r\nessential to maximize visual outcome.\r\nFUTURE AND CONTROVERSIES: \r\nA better understanding of the cellular and biochemical\r\nmechanisms involving normal and traumatized axons, glia, and myelin\r\nsheaths may eventually leads to better intervention for traumatic optic\r\nneuropathy. Although corticosteroids are a type of neuroprotective\r\nagents, the recent expansion in basic scientific research regarding other\r\nneuroprotective agents may lead to a redirection in future therapy for\r\nthis condition. CONCLUSION:\r\nIn our study the clinical profile of 100 eligible patients who\r\npresented with loss of vision following trauma during June 2008 – May\r\n2010 were analyzed.\t\r\nRESULTS:\r\nBased on exclusion and inclusion criteria 100 cases were taken up for the study.",

      "abstract": "Anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 limbic encephalitis (Anti-LGI 1 LE) is a subtype of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) and the most common cause of limbic encephalitis (LE). Clinically, it can have an acute to sub-acute onset of confusion and cognitive impairment, facial-brachial dystonic seizures (FDBS), and psychiatric disturbances. The clinical manifestations are varied, and its diagnosis requires high clinical suspicion to avoid delay in the treatment. When patients manifest mostly psychiatric symptoms, the disease may not be immediately recognized. We aim to report a case of Anti-LGI 1 LE in which the patient presented acute psychotic symptoms and was initially diagnosed with unspecified psychosis. We present a case of a patient with sub-acute behavioral changes, short-term memory loss, and insomnia who was brought to the emergency department after a sudden episode of disorganized behavior and speech. On medical examination, the patient presented persecutory delusions and indirect signs of auditory hallucinations. An initial diagnosis of unspecified psychosis was performed. Investigations revealed right temporal epileptiform activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG), abnormal bilateral hyperintensities in the temporal lobes in the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a positive titer of anti-LGI 1 antibodies (Abs) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to a diagnosis of anti-LGI 1 LE. The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) steroids and immunoglobulin and later with IV rituximab. In patients that predominantly present with psychotic and cognitive disorders the diagnosis of anti-LGI 1 LE can be delayed predisposing them to a poorer prognosis (permanent cognitive impairment - especially short-term memory loss - and persistent seizures). It is necessary to be aware of this diagnosis when evaluating acute to sub-acute psychiatric illness developing with cognitive impairment (specially with memory loss) to avoid diagnosis delays and long-term sequelae.",

Despite the fact that dementia is a constant finding in this disease only a few papers have studied the timing of riental deterioration. We have performed wide neuropsychological testing in two cases early diagnosed as Lafora disease. The initial neuropsychological testing was carried out by the time there were no complaints of mental deterioration in both cases. In the first case consecutive neuropsychological testing demonstrated the rapidly progressive dementia. All neuropsychological testings in these cases showed severe impairment of right parietal lobe functions. Higher cortical functions related to language and intelectual processes were beet preserved in both cases. The functions related to constructional praxis, memory and abstract concepts and processes were severily impaired. Our data suggest that mental deterioration is an early manifestation in Lafora disease, even by the time normal social life is not yet disturbed. Dominant hemisphere cognitivo functions have been less impaired than the non-dominant ones. How a diffuse illness such as Lafora disease can cause such an asymmetrical higher cortical function deficit is not yet clear.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews recent literature which suggests that sleep disturbance in members of the general population, whether or not they have ever had a formal psychiatric disorder, is a risk factor for the onset of a formal psychiatric diagnosis at a later time. Based upon the current literature, the strongest link is between subjective insomnia, lasting at least 2 weeks, and the later onset of depression. Less well-established data suggest that lifetime reports of at least 2 weeks of insomnia, hypersomnia, or both hypersomnia and insomnia, are risk factors for the later development of depression, anxiety disorders or substance abuse. More tentatively, preliminary data suggest that increasing subjective sleep disturbance may signal a relapse in remitted depressed patients. Sleep disturbances are common manifestations of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Therefore, sleep complaints may be among the most robust prodromal symptoms reflecting partial depressive or anxiety disorders, which eventually declare themselves as full-blown clinical episodes.",

      "abstract": "Falls are a major health problem among the elderly and an estimated 6% of falls by elderly result in fractures. Early identification of fall risk is likely to result in earlier implementation of intervention and to minimise development of secondary problems such as reduced confidence and activity levels. A comprehensive falls risk factor assessment should be performed for older people who present for medical attention after a fall, those who had more than one fall in the preceding year or those who have abnormalities of gait or balance. Falls are as a result of extrinsic risk factors, intrinsic risk factor or a combination of both. Syncope is defined as a transient, self limited loss of consciousness usually leading to a fall. Syncope and falls are often considered two separate entities with different aetiologies. Disorders affecting balance in the elderly are cerebral, cerebellar, spinal cord disorders; dementia; arrhythmias; postural hypotension; cerebrovascular disease; musculoskeletal/orthopaedic disorders; intervertebral disc disorders; psychological factors; visual impairment. Effective interventions include: (1) Health promotion and falls prevention. (2) Single interventions. (3) Medication review. (4) Exercise. (5) Home modifications. (6) To improve safety in the home. (7) To improve safety outside the home. Effective preventive strategies require better understanding of the causes of and risk factors for falling among elderly.",

The clinical course and outcome of a persistent vegetative state depend on its cause. Post-traumatic unawareness persisting for more than a month should not be considered an irreversible condition, because an outcome that might be regarded by some as being acceptable is possible even in patients with very severe brain damage. Recovery of consciousness from a posttraumatic persistent vegetative state is unlikely after 12 months in adults and children. For most such patients, life expectancy ranges from 2 to 5 years; survival beyond 10 years is unusual. Corpus callosum and dorsolateral brainstem lesions are highly significant in predicting nonrecovery. Long-term prognosis of post-traumatic vegetative state (VS) remains poorly defined. Essential prognostic factors of VS include threat blink reflex presence, ventricular dilatation, brainstem and corpus callosal injury; motor score (Glasgow Coma Score) and presence of spontaneous eye movements.",

Diagnosis of normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), defined as glaucoma without a clearly abnormal IOP, depends on recognizing symptoms and signs associated with optic nerve vulnerability, in addition to absence of other explanations for disc abnormality and visual field loss. Among the findings are a halo or crescent of absence of retinal pigment epithelium around the disc, bilateral pre-chiasmal visual field defects, splinter hemorrhages at the disc margin, vascular dysregulation (low blood pressure, cold hands and feet, migraine headache with aura, and the like), or a family history of glaucoma. Possibly relevant, is a history of hemodynamic crisis, arterial obstructive disease, or sleep apnea. Neurological evaluation with imaging is needed only for atypical cases or ones that progress unexpectedly. Management follows the same principle of other chronic glaucomas, to lower the IOP by a substantial amount, enough to prevent disabling visual loss. However, many NTG cases are non-progressive. Therefore, it may often be wise in mild cases to determine whether the case is progressive and the rate of progression before deciding on how aggressivene to be with therapy.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To outline unique clinical features seen in fulminant neuropathy associated with thiamine deficiency. BACKGROUND: Thiamine deficiency can rarely mimic acquired neuropathies such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome(GBS). Thiamine deficiency may have variable presentation due to multisystem dysfunction including dry beriberi affecting peripheral nerves, Shoshin/wet beriberi affecting cardiovascular system or Wernicke/Korsakoff with CNS involvement. DESIGN/METHODS: Chart review of two cases of thiamine deficiency with features of dry beriberi, wet beriberi and Wernicke9s encephalopathy. RESULTS: Case 1: 72 year-old male with a history of diabetes and remote Whipple procedure who presented with four weeks of weakness and sensory loss. Exam showed distal sensory loss, mild proximal and distal lower limb weakness, and reduced reflexes. Axonal neuropathy was noted on EMG. CSF showed cytoalbuminologic dissociation. IVIG was initiated for a presumptive diagnosis of GBS. He subsequently developed hypotension requiring pressors, lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, ocular muscle weakness and respiratory failure. Case 2: 38 year-old male with a history of alcoholism and Crohn9s was transferred to our facility with 3-4 weeks of progressive sensory and motor deficits, hypotension, tachycardia, and lactic acidosis attributed to GBS and superimposed sepsis. He subsequently developed severe generalized weakness, respiratory failure, encephalopathy and extraocular muscle paresis. Workup revealed axonal neuropathy, no infection and normal CSF findings. Diagnosis/Treatment: In both cases, features of Wernicke9s and wet beriberi prompted the clinical suspicion supported by brain MRI studies and reduced thiamine levels (19&23 nmol/liter; normal 80-150nmol/liter). Hypotension and cardiac failure rapidly resolved with thiamine repletion. Ocular muscle weakness and encephalopathy resolved within days, but limb weakness only partially improved. CONCLUSIONS: A high index of suspicion for thiamine deficiency in patients presenting with progressive neuropathy is important as there is significant overlap with GBS. Development of hypotension, tachycardia, lactic acidosis, mental status changes, or extraocular muscle paresis in cases of possible GBS should prompt consideration of thiamine deficiency.

      "abstract": "Introduction. Both cognitive psychology and neuropsychology require an approach to the multidimensional 'attention'. Development. Attention permits behaviour to be suitable to the task in hand. According to the situation or activity required, the components or mechanisms of attention necessary vary (selectivity, alertness, vigilance, focus, inhibitory control mechanisms, etc.) as do the different neural networks involved. In the different neuropsychological syndromes different components and attention mechanisms are affected. For instance, in attention deficit disorder there is inability to take notice of control of carrying out inappropriate responses, whilst in visual heminegligence there may be a defect of a mechanism such as disconnection of attention selective to a given space. To obtain coherent results in the study of attention disorders in various syndromes, the different components and attention mechanisms should be systematically evaluated using specific tests. In neuropsychology frequently the tests use donly measured the aspects most closely connected to speed of perception and visual selective attention, without evaluating other components. Sometimes study data measuring different aspects of attention have been compared, and therefore the conclusions drawn regarding possible attention disorders were controversial. The lack of standardised data and the difficulty of establishing 'pure' tests of attention mechanisms make the task more arduous. Conclusion. Only the integration of experimental studies of cognitive psychology and the techniques and procedures of neuropsychology permit clarification of the construction and the advance of explanatory models. © 2001, REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) occurs most commonly in infancy and childhood. Children with prior neurological abnormalities are most susceptible. More than 90% of cases are convulsive and the majority are generalized. SE may occur in the setting of an acute illness, in patients with established epilepsy or as a first unprovoked seizure. The etiology can be classified as idiopathic, remote symptomatic, febrile, acute symptomatic, or associated with a progressive encephalopathy. The morbidity and mortality of status have dramatically declined in recent years. Overall mortality in recent pediatric series was 3-10%, with almost all fatalities associated with acute central nervous system insults or progressive neurologic disorders. Neurological sequelae in children with idiopathic or febrile status are rare. Neurologically normal children with SE as their first unprovoked seizure have the same risk of experiencing subsequent seizures of any type as children who present with a brief first seizure. The risk of recurrent episodes of convulsive SE approaches 50% in neurologically abnormal children but is very low in neurologically normal children. The favorable outcome of SE in children may be related to advances in therapy and to the resistance of the immature brain to damage from seizures.",

      "title": "Long-term sequelae of epilepsy.",
      "abstract": "The long-term prognosis for epileptics vary from an entirely normal life to early death or complete incapacity. Studies to date have not provided clear answers on the long-term sequelae of epilepsy. This is because there are many epileptic syndromes with different outcomes. Most studies include a heterogeneous group of patients who may not be representative of all the epileptics in the community. The prognosis for permanent remission of seizure varies with the seizure type. In childhood epilepsies, overall there is at least 50% chance of permanent remission. The more seizures the patient has had before anticonvulsants were started, the more difficult it is to control the seizures, the poorer the prospects for remission. Other unfavourable signs include partial seizures, multiple seizure types, mental retardation, neurological deficits and underlying brain lesion. The effect of seizures on intellectual development is controversial. Actual regression in children with epilepsy is rare except where the seizures are caused by a progressive pathology. However, in a significant proportion of children, intellectual development slows down after the onset of seizures. This is more likely to occur in children with severe seizures, and those on multiple anticonvulsants and with frequent toxic levels. Children with epilepsy have an increased likelihood of developing behavioural, emotional and psychiatric problems. The underlying neurological dysfunction, anxiety about losing control of oneself at any time, reaction of parents, friends and teachers to the condition and side effects of anticonvulsants all contribute to the psychopathology. In conclusion, the long-term sequelae of epilepsy are multiple and serious. Some of the causal factors are known and preventable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "The unusual aspect of dream consciousness which has been called \"dream bizarreness\" may be defined as impossibility or improbability in the domains of dream plot, cognition and affect. The bizarre features of dreams may be divided into three broad categories: discontinuities, incongruities and uncertainties. Discontinuities are interruptions in orientational stability; incongruities are inappropriate syntheses of mismatching plot elements; uncertainties are confusions of distinct conceptions. Dream bizarreness appears to be the manifestation of some state-dependent cognitive process which is probably rooted in REM sleep neurophysiology. In the waking state, our brain/minds are capable of remaining focused on the normal flow of ongoing information, and such features of life as plot and time unfold in a linear sequence. In REM sleep/dreaming, this function appears to be interfered with, and disparate elements of consciousness are suddenly interjected as the brain/mind cannot maintain its orientational focus in the usual way.",

Systemic lupus erythematosus is the prototype of connective tissue diseases that can present with a full spectrum of neurological and mental disorders. It is quite difficult to establish an accurate etiological diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with predominant neuropsychiatric symptoms. The exact timing of neurological manifestations remains controversial: either the central nervous system is the initial target of autoimmune disorders, or neurological symptoms are part of a multisystem lesion. Antiphospholipid syndrome is a prothrombotic systemic autoimmune disease with heterogeneous clinical and pathological manifestations and is a well-established cause of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, especially in young patients. There is growing recognition of a broader spectrum of cerebrovascular lesions associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, including white matter hyperintensities, cortical atrophy, and lacunar infarcts, which may have clinically important neurocognitive consequences. The article provides a review of the literature examining the spectrum of neurological disorders in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and the inflammatory and cytokine mechanisms that play an important role in the pathogenesis of nervous system damage in systemic lupus erythematosus.",

      "abstract": "The knowledge of the brain processes underlying mental disorders has significantly increased during the last decades, but in spite of this very important research effort a biological marker is not available for such disorders. For example, neurophysiological techniques (EEG and MEG),have been broadly utilized in the investigation of the most important psychiatric syndromes such as schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder or obsessive/compulsive disorder. The outcomes of some of those neurophysiological studies allowed the building of statistical models with very high sensitivity and specificity, although those models did not reach day-to-day clinical practice. A potential explanation for this situation is an inadequate analysis procedure which might be missing some important quantums of information contained in brain signals. In this vein, new methods of non-linear analysis have been proposed for the investigation of neurophysiological data. Particularly, the analysis of brain signals' complexity has been broadly utilized in the investigation of psychiatric disorders. Parameters of EEG-MEG complexity usually estimate the predictability of brain oscillations and/or the number of independent oscillators underlying the observed signals. More importantly, complexity parameters seem to be sensitive to the temporal components of brain activity, and therefore might reflect the dynamical nature of psychiatric disorders. This paper reviews some of the most relevant studies within this field, especially those focusing on the diagnosis, follow-up and prediction of response to treatment.",

      "title": "Mucopolysaccharidosis type II",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II; also known as Hunter syndrome) is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation. The vast majority of affected individuals are male; on rare occasion heterozygous females manifest findings. Age of onset, disease severity, and rate of progression vary significantly among affected males. In those with early progressive disease, CNS involvement (manifest primarily by progressive cognitive deterioration), progressive airway disease, and cardiac disease usually result in death in the first or second decade of life. In those with slowly progressive disease, the CNS is not (or is minimally) affected, although the effect of GAG accumulation on other organ systems may be early progressive to the same degree as in those who have progressive cognitive decline. Survival into the early adult years with normal intelligence is common in the slowly progressing form of the disease. Additional findings in both forms of MPS II include: short stature; macrocephaly with or without communicating hydrocephalus; macroglossia; hoarse voice; conductive and sensorineural hearing loss; hepatosplenomegaly; dysostosis multiplex; spinal stenosis; and carpal tunnel syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MPS II is established in a male proband by identification of deficient iduronate 2-sulfatase (I2S) enzyme activity in white cells, fibroblasts, or plasma in the presence of normal activity of at least one other sulfatase. Detection of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in IDS confirms the diagnosis in a male proband with an unusual phenotype or a phenotype that does not match the results of GAG testing. The diagnosis of MPS II is usually established in a female proband with suggestive clinical features by identification of a heterozygous IDS pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Interventions commonly include: developmental, occupational, and physical therapy; shunting for hydrocephalus; tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy; positive pressure ventilation (CPAP or tracheostomy); carpal tunnel release; cardiac valve replacement; inguinal hernia repair; hip replacement. Prevention of primary manifestations: Weekly enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with infusions of idursulfase (Elaprase®), a recombinant form of human iduronate 2-sulfatase, is approved to treat somatic manifestations and prolong survival. Pretreatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or antihistamines may be needed for mild or moderate infusion reactions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (using umbilical cord blood or bone marrow) could provide sufficient enzyme activity to slow or stop the progression of the disease; however, no controlled clinical studies have been conducted in MPS II. Prevention of secondary complications: Anesthesia is best administered in centers familiar with the potential complications in persons with MPS II. Surveillance: Depends on organ system and disease severity and usually includes annual: cardiology evaluation and echocardiogram; pulmonary evaluation including pulmonary function testing; audiogram; ophthalmology examination; developmental assessment; neurologic examination. Additional studies may include: sleep study for obstructive apnea; nerve conduction velocity to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome; head/neck MRI to document ventricular size and cervicomedullary narrowing; opening pressure on lumbar puncture; and orthopedic evaluation to monitor hip disease. Evaluation of relatives at risk: While clinical experience suggests that early diagnosis of at-risk males allows initiation of ERT before the onset of irreversible changes and often before significant disease progression, it is unclear at present whether the potential benefits of early initiation of ERT justify early diagnosis by either newborn screening or testing of at-risk male relatives. Genetic counseling MPS II is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs depends on the genetic status of the mother. If the mother of the proband has the pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers. Germline mosaicism has been observed. Affected males pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.",

      "abstract": "Neurologists are often called to evaluate central nervous system [CNS] manifestations in patients with suspected or definite systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]. The manifestations are highly diverse and often have major prognostic consequences. The major difficulties are to determine if the given manifestation is primarily due to SLE activity in the brain, or a consequence of metabolic disturbances, infection, or corticosteroid use. The true incidence of CNS manifestations attributable to SLE is not entirely clear, but several studies show prevalence rate between 15-75%, depending on criteria adopted. For cognitive impairment, the prevalence ranges from 17-59%. Cognitive impairment may be attributed to emotional distress, corticosteroid use, active systemic disease or primary CNS dysfunction. These manifestations may occur even in the absence of other neuropsychiatric [NP] manifestations clearly attributable to SLE. The etiology of cognitive impairment may be related to autoimmune mechanisms, such as brain-specific autoantibodies. Despite several studies using computer tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], brain structural abnormalities could not be associated with cognitive findings in SLE patients. Functional neuroimaging methods may be more sensitive for detecting subclinical brain involvement related to cognitive dysfunction in SLE. Despite the fact that cognitive impairment may be residual in patients with previous CNS involvement, it also may be an early marker of CNS involvement in previous asymptomatic patients. This article will review clinical assessment, pathogenic mechanism, and the role of neuroimaging methods in the evaluating of SLE patients with cognitive impairment.

Disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) facilitating entrance of neurotoxic antibodies into the central nervous system (CNS), neuroinflammation and cerebral ischemia are the key mechanisms. Although neuropsychiatric events are common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), less than one-third of these events can be directly attributed to SLE. Increased generalised SLE disease activity or damage, previous or concurrent major neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) events, and persistently positive moderate-to-high antiphospholipid antibody titers are established risk factors, and their presence could facilitate proper attribution to the disease itself. Diagnostic evaluation is guided by the presenting manifestation; MRI is used to visualize brain or spinal pathologies. For neuropsychiatric events believed to reflect an immune or inflammatory process, or when these events occur in the context of active generalised disease, evidence (primarily from uncontrolled studies) supports the use of glucocorticoids alone or in combination with immunosuppressive therapy. Antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy is recommended for NPSLE manifestations related to antiphospholipid antibodies, especially for thrombotic cerebrovascular disease. <h3>Learning Objectives</h3> Describe the most common neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE and their underlying pathophysiology and be able to attribute them to SLE or to other unrelated causes Distinguish between inflammatory vs thrombotic/embolic events Explain the use of the most appropriate immunosuppressive, anticoagulant/antiplatelet or adjunct therapies Describe the long-term prognosis and emerging therapies for patients with NPSLE",

      "title": "Cognitive Visual Dysfunction in a Child with Cerebral Damage",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Visual impairment as a sequel to cortical damage can be associated with complex disorders in cognitive visual function. Such dysfunction can be difficult to diagnose with certainty, particularly in children, owing to the child's problems of awareness and communication. The authors describe the case of a 13‐year‐old girl whose cerebral damage is apparently accompanied by complex cognitive visual disorders.

      "abstract": "This chapter deals mainly with common acute and chronic neurological problems, particularly as they affect employees and job applicants. The complications of occupational exposure to neurotoxins and putative neurotoxins are also covered in so far as they relate to the fitness of an exposed employee to continue working. In addition to a few well-known and common conditions, many uncommon but distinct neurological disorders may present at work or affect work capacity. Fitness for work in these disorders will be determined by the person’s functional abilities, any co-morbid illness, the efficacy or side effects of the treatment, and psychological and social factors, rather than by the precise diagnosis. This will also need to be put into the context of the job in question, as the basic requirements for a manual labouring job may be completely different from something more intellectually demanding. Indeed, even an apparently precise diagnostic label such as multiple sclerosis can encompass a complete spectrum of disability, from someone who is entirely asymptomatic to another who is totally incapacitated. Furthermore, reports by general practitioners, neurologists, or neurosurgeons may describe the symptoms, signs, and investigations in detail, but without analysing functional abilities. These colleagues may also fail to appreciate the workplace hazards, the responsibilities of the employer, or what scope exists for adaptations to the job or workplace.",

      "title": "MO1023BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME OR SENIOR-LOKEN SYNDROME? GOING BEYOND THE OBVIOUS",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Nephronophthisis (NPHP), a ciliopathy which almost always causes end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), may have extrarenal symptoms such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Senior-Loken syndrome (SLS), and these are called NPHP-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC). Bardet-Bield syndrome and SLS share similar clinical features, so that definitive diagnosis might depend on genetic analysis. Bardet-Bield syndrome diagnosis is typically based on clinical manifestations, which comprise, for example, renal defects, polydactyly, obesity, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), learning difficulties, in addition to secondary manifestations such as development delay, speech defects, hypertension, among others. Senior-Loken syndrome classical encompasses familial NPHP and RP; additional variable features can include skeletal, liver, neurologic and other visual defects, as well as obesity. NPHP genes are the most commonly affected in NPHP. Although disruption of the NPHP5 and NPHP6 genes are the most frequent cause of SLS, at least variants in ten genes have been reported. We present a case of a young girl clinically diagnosed with BBS, later known to be a SLS based on genetic analysis, revealing an unusual affected gene. Method We reviewed this case based on medical records. Results The patient presented with polydactyly at birth and pre-obesity in the first six months of age. At the age of 4 years she was first evaluated by ophthalmology due to reduced visual acuity which evolved unfavorably with severe generalized retinal dysfunction and moderate maculopathy at the age of 9 years. Delayed development and poor social skills were increasingly evident, as wells as short stature, small hands and dysmorphic facial features. At the age of 12 years bilateral transmission hearing loss was diagnosed and two years later she was referred to Endocrinology due to hirsutism, stretch marks and cushingoid facies. In this context, blood work was performed and surprisingly revealed plasma creatinine of 2.19 mg/dL and urea of 65 mg/dL. Kidney ultrasound revealed reduced dimensions and increased parenchymal echogenicity; an obstructive component was excluded. She rapidly progressed to ESKD and dialysis dependence. Bardet-Biedl syndrome was considered. She was referred for transplant assessment and underwent genetic testing. A homozygous likely pathogenic variant was identified in TRAF3IP1 gene, compatible with SLS 9 (autosomal recessive inheritance). Conclusion Although phenotype-based diagnosis was common in ciliopathies, genetic testing is now regularly used for definitive diagnosis. Mutations in the geneTRAF3IP1 were only recently described, particularly in patients presenting with NPHP, RP, skeletal defects, hepatic fibrosis and hexadactyly; ESKD is frequent between 3 and 16 years and SLS is formally associated. Our patient had several clinical manifestations suggestive of BBS, and presumptive diagnosis was assumed (although noticeable phenotypic overlap with SLS exists). Genetic analysis was crucial; the identified mutation in TRAF3IP1 justifies some of the extra-SLS/BBS-like manifestations. Patients must be monitored carefully, namely related to ESKD and extrarenal manifestations; there is also the need for segregation analysis (divorced parents and half-brothers). Ultimately this case represents a consequence of genetics evolution, with a wide genetic and clinical variability now described within these syndromes.",

      "title": "REM Sleep Behavior Disorder",
      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a brain disorder, characterized by the dream enactment during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep due to a lack of physiologic muscle atonia and increased muscle twitching. Schenk was the first to describe this disorder in 1986; however, few authors reported in the 1970-1980s loss of physiological muscle atonia combined with dream enactment in the course of brainstem disorders and as a consequence of alcoholism and antidepressant treatment. RBD affects less than 1% of the adult population, but can be found in up to 25-50% of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease, multisystem atrophy, and dementia with Lewy body. In the last decade, many studies provided evidence that RBD precedes parkinsonian motor signs by several years, suggesting that RBD should no longer be considered a complication but a part of the prodromal phase of these diseases. Etiologically, primary (idiopathic RBD) and several secondary forms in addition to neurodegeneration (related to focal brainstem damage, narcolepsy, autoimmune disorders, and drugs) are known. Pathophysiologically, brainstem and supratentorial mechanisms involving glutamatergic, glycinergic, and GABA-ergic neurotransmission have been implicated. Recently, an animal model of RBD has been described. Clinical features consist of characteristic nocturnal behaviors, but also daytime symptoms including excessive sleepiness and cognitive alterations. The diagnosis of RBD is made according to international diagnostic criteria, based on medical history, and video-polysomnographic features. Current treatment strategies include actions which ensure a safe sleep environment, the avoidance of triggering/exacerbating factors and if necessary pharmacological (mainly clonazepam and melatonin) and non-pharmacological (e.g., behavioral measures) interventions. Future research should clarify the exact sleep-wake characteristics of RBD (also beyond REM sleep) and their evolution over time, the contribution of brainstem but also supratentorial mechanisms to its pathophysiology, and the (early?) diagnostic and (causative?) treatment consequences of RBD in the context of neurodegeneration.",

Anti-ganglioside antibodies (GM, GD and GQ) in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are sometimes informative for the diagnosis of BBE because of the rarity of positive findings in other diagnositic methods: brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), routine CSF examination, motor nerve conduction study, and needle electromyography. We report a rare case of childhood BBE with elevated anti-GM1 antibodies in the serum, who had specific clinical symptoms such as a cranial polyneuropathy presenting as ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and facial weakness; progressive motor weakness; altered mental status; and ataxia. However, the brain MRI, routine CSF examination, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, somatosensory evoked potentials, and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were normal. BBE was suspected and the patient was successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulins. (Korean J Pediatr 2010;53:607-611)",

Patients who described it as unpleasant were noted to also demonstrate elevated anxiety. Patients who identified the presence as a known person, described it as touching them, or interacted with the presence emotionally or physically demonstrated reduced insight. Patients with presence phenomena demonstrated more frequent impairments in visual processing, executive function and speed of processing.Presence phenomena occur in the company of advancing cognitive impairment and involvement of the posterior cortical functions. Initially encountered as a neutral spatial skeleton, the experience is then shaped by the patient's affective state and level of insight.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy refers to disorders of the peripheral nervous system. They have numerous causes and diverse presentations; hence, a systematic and logical approach is needed for cost-effective diagnosis, especially of treatable neuropathies. A detailed history of symptoms, family and occupational history should be obtained. General and systemic examinations provide valuable clues. Neurological examinations investigating sensory, motor and autonomic signs help to define the topography and nature of neuropathy. Large fiber neuropathy manifests with the loss of joint position and vibration sense and sensory ataxia, whereas small fiber neuropathy manifests with the impairment of pain, temperature and autonomic functions. Electrodiagnostic (EDx) tests include sensory, motor nerve conduction, F response, H reflex and needle electromyography (EMG). EDx helps in documenting the extent of sensory motor deficits, categorizing demyelinating (prolonged terminal latency, slowing of nerve conduction velocity, dispersion and conduction block) and axonal (marginal slowing of nerve conduction and small compound muscle or sensory action potential and dennervation on EMG). Uniform demyelinating features are suggestive of hereditary demyelination, whereas difference between nerves and segments of the same nerve favor acquired demyelination. Finally, neuropathy is classified into mononeuropathy commonly due to entrapment or trauma; mononeuropathy multiplex commonly due to leprosy and vasculitis; and polyneuropathy due to systemic, metabolic or toxic etiology. Laboratory investigations are carried out as indicated and specialized tests such as biochemical, immunological, genetic studies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination and nerve biopsy are carried out in selected patients. Approximately 20% patients with neuropathy remain undiagnosed but the prognosis is not bad in them.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations of diurnal variation of mood and early morning awakening in depression have been incorporated into established diagnostic systems, as has the seasonal modifier defining winter depression (seasonal affective disorder, SAD). Many circadian rhythms measured in depressive patients are abnormal: earlier in timing, diminished in amplitude, or of greater variability. Whether these disturbances are of etiological significance for the role of circadian rhythms in mood disorders, or a consequence of altered behavior can only be dissected out with stringent protocols (eg, constant routine or forced desynchrony). These protocols quantify contributions of the circadian pacemaker and a homeostatic sleep process impacting on mood, energy, appetite, and sleep. Future studies will elucidate any allelic mutations in \"circadian clock\" -related or \"sleep\"-related genes in depression. With respect to treatment, antidepressants and mood stabilizers have no consistent effect on circadian rhythmicity. The most rapid antidepressant modality known so far is nonpharmacological: total or partial sleep deprivation in the second half of the night. The disadvantage of sleep deprivation, that most patients relapse after recovery sleep, can be prevented by coadministration of lithium, pindolol, serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors, bright light, or a subsequent phase-advance procedure. Phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle alone also has rapid effects on depressed mood, which lasts longer than sleep deprivation. Light is the treatment of choice for SAD and may prove to be useful for nonseasonal depression, alone or as an adjunct to medication. Chronobiological concepts emphasize the important role of zeitgebers to stabilize phase, light being the most important, but dark (and rest) periods, regularity of social schedules and meal times, and use of melatonin or its analogues should also be considered. Advances in chronobiology continue to contribute novel treatments for affective disorders.",

Hacer una revision de las alteraciones motoras del habla, de la valoracion funcional y de la intervencion logopedica en la disartria flacida. Desarrollo. Se plantea la caracterizacion clinica de las alteraciones en la produccion verbal de origen periferico, concretamente de la disartria flacida y sus manifestaciones respiratorias, fonatorias, de resonancia, de articulacion y de prosodia. Seguidamente, se esboza la valoracion funcional y se plantean las lineas de intervencion para su tratamiento. Conclusiones. Las manifestaciones clinicas de la disartria flacida son muy heterogeneas y van desde leves dificultades articulatorias a graves trastornos que limitan gravemente la capacidad para la expresion verbal. En la mayoria de los casos, la exploracion funcional proporciona hallazgos valiosos para su identificacion y tipificacion, para determinar la necesidad de valoraciones complementarias y para establecer el programa idoneo de intervencion logopedica.

The condition has been reported in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics treated with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents who typically have a history of poor glycaemic control. Pathogenesis of the condition and its associated pain is poorly understood, with proposed mechanisms including endoneurial ischaemia, hypoglycaemic microvascular neuronal damage and regenerating nerve firing. Pain can affect other areas including the trunk and abdomen, or be more generalised. “Diabetic neuropathic cachexia” is a rare disorder associated with poor diabetic control that presents with large amounts of unintentional weight loss associated with an acute symmetrical painful peripheral neuropathy without weakness. Pain is characteristically burning in nature with predominant lower limb involvement and allodynia. The disorder can also affect type 1 and type 2 diabetics and occur irrespective of the duration of their diabetes. Depression and in males, impotence, appear to be common, although other autonomic features can be present. Typically it has a monophasic course but has been reported to be recurrent. As with insulin neuritis, this condition is reversible over weeks to months after adequate diabetic control. For both disorders, the pain can be treatment resistant despite the use of multiple analgesics. Keywords: Cachexia, diabetes, insulin, neuropathy, neuritis, treatment",

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the family prototype and is a diffuse neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both upper and lower motor neuron cell death, causing progressive paralysis of limb, bulbar (speech and swallowing) and respiratory muscles, and resulting in death from respiratory failure. The cardinal clinical feature of combined upper and lower motor neuron signs in various body regions (bulbar, arms, trunk, legs) forms the basis for diagnostic criteria.

In this review we will discuss in particular form of ASD and altered sensory sensitivity. The role of NGF in causing pronociceptive activity and its role in peripheral sensitisation is discussed under the light of its involvement in forms of MR where loss of pain perception is a main feature due to mutations to NGF receptors or NGF genes during development. Other forms of MR with altered sensory impairment will be considered as well as additional potential mechanisms involved.",

The residual embryologic vascular plexus forms leptomeningela, facial and ocular hemangiomas as etiological defects in SWS; there are reports about somatic mutation, somatic mosaic, 4q inversion and trisomy 10 being responsible for the structural and functional regulation of the vascular plexus. Fibronectin, which is known to intervene in angiogenesis, is reduced, and the decreased level of endorphin I leads to vasoconstriction of the cortical vascular plexus. Case report The authors present a SWS case whose neurological symptoms, contralateral partial seizures with secondary generalization, appear in febrile context in a 2 year old child with normal neurological development. The acute febrile illness evolves like a viral meningitis. Conclusion In Sturge-Weber syndrome, the neurological monitoring and control therapy of the critical symptoms are major objectives.",

      "title": "Electroencephalography in the differential diagnosis of dementia",
      "abstract": "In this short clinically oriented review, the value of electroencephalography (EEG) in the diagnostic evaluation of cognitive decline is discussed, based on the recommendations of the European and Dutch guidelines. In general, an EEG with diffuse slowing with or without focal abnormalities argues for the presence of an underlying neurodegenerative illness and against subjective memory complaints or a psychiatric illness such as a depression. The value of an EEG in the differential diagnosis between the most common causes of dementia is dependent on the specific clinical problem. One of the clinical problems in which EEG has the highest yield is the distinction between the two most common dementia types, i.e. Lewy Body Dementia (DLB) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD): severe slowing of the background rhythm with a peak frequency in the theta frequency band (4 - 8 Hz) accompanied by frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) gives strong EEG support for DLB, whereas a diagnosis of AD is more likely when the EEG is normal or when only mild diffuse slowing is found. Furthermore, a normal EEG in an early onset dementia gives support for the diagnosis frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In addition, EEG is very useful when a metabolic, toxic or infectious encephalopathy is suspected. An EEG should be performed in subacute disease courses, with auto-immune encephalitis or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease as possible causes, or when (temporal lobe) epilepsy is suspected. In conclusion, EEG is most valuable in a specific differential diagnosis together with the clinical context and other diagnostic tests. Distinct EEG patterns can then help to make one of the diagnoses a more or less likely cause of the patient’s symptoms.",

It is also unclear whether sleep complaints show specificity with certain disorders or if they are nonspecific symptoms. We examined the structure of sleep complaints and the relations of these complaints to depression and anxiety in three samples: college students, older adults, and psychiatric patients. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that sleep complaints consistently defined two distinct dimensions: Insomnia and Lassitude. The Insomnia factor included indicators of early, middle, and late insomnia, as well as poor sleep quality. The Lassitude factor included measures of hypersomnia, fatigue, and sleepiness. Both factors were significantly related to symptoms and diagnoses of depression and anxiety. However, Lassitude was more strongly related to symptoms of depression and anxiety than was Insomnia. In addition, Lassitude showed specificity to measures and diagnoses of depression compared to anxiety disorders. This specificity can be explained by Lassitude’s relation with negative and positive emotionality, both of which are components of depression.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "title": "[Apathy: a useful but limited concept].",
      "abstract": "In the nineties, Marin proposed to define apathy as a clinical syndrome due to a lack of motivation. The syndrome is characterized by a diminished goal-directed overt behaviors, a lack of interest or concern for social and personal activities and a lack of responsiveness to positive and negative events. Apathy is clearly distinct from depression and can be observed in many conditions, in healthy people as well as in psychiatric disorders such as depression or schizophrenia. It is very common in patients with brain lesions involving the frontal lobes, the right hemisphere, but also in degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Motivation, considered as the source of apathy by Marin, is not a simple construct. It refers to a complex set of multiple affective and cognitive processes. However, it is considered, either in an energetic acception, as a single quantitative variable, a force which impulses action but not direct behavior or, in a more specific acception, as the factor which direct behavior towards specific actions. The description of apathy by Marin and the scales designed to its assessment, are based on the first acception. The term apathy is only descriptive, such as those of dysphasia or anosognosia. They do not allow to study the mechanisms underlying the motivation disorders, essential process for the management of apathetic patients. A tentative qualitative approach to assess motivation disorders is proposed, using a semi-structured interview. However, it should be stressed that motivation can not be directly assessed: motivation is a concept to explain some behavior disorders and an inference from the study of behavior.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Catatonic disorder due to general medical condition must be excluded in psychiatric patients presenting with this movement disorder. This report emphasizes the association of catatonia with multiple sclerosis. Method: A patient with catatonia, psychotic depression, and the subsequent diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is described and the literature reviewed. Results: Mutism, immobility, cataplexy, waxy flexibility, and other aspects of catatonia occur in multiple sclerosis, usually as a consequence of a severe mood disorder and extensive cerebral demyelination. These symptoms may be the presenting manifestations of multiple sclerosis. Conclusions: A high index of suspicion for neurological disease is indicated in patients with new-onset catatonia. Neuroimaging and other studies may reveal underlying demyelination requiring specific therapy.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews studies that have examined associations between unusual sleep experiences (including nightmares, vivid dreaming, narcolepsy symptoms, and complex nighttime behaviors) and dissociation and schizotypy. Using correlational studies and structural analyses, evidence is provided that unusual sleep experiences, dissociation, and schizotypy belong to a common domain. It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue). The paper also outlines the methodological limitations of the existing evidence and makes suggestions for future research. Finally, three models for the overlap of daytime and nighttime symptoms are reviewed, including biological abnormalities, trauma, and personality traits. Although further research is needed, it is suggested that daytime and nighttime symptoms result from problems with sleep-wake state boundaries, which may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition, association between daytime and nighttime symptoms can be attributed to the higher order personality trait of Oddity.",

      "title": "Deficits in cholinergic neurotransmission and their clinical correlates in Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract In view of its ability to explain the most frequent motor symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease (PD), degeneration of dopaminergic neurons has been considered one of the disease’s main pathophysiological features. Several studies have shown that neurodegeneration also affects noradrenergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic and other monoaminergic neuronal populations. In this work, the characteristics of cholinergic deficits in PD and their clinical correlates are reviewed. Important neurophysiological processes at the root of several motor and cognitive functions remit to cholinergic neurotransmission at the synaptic, pathway, and circuital levels. The bulk of evidence highlights the link between cholinergic alterations and PD motor symptoms, gait dysfunction, levodopa-induced dyskinesias, cognitive deterioration, psychosis, sleep abnormalities, autonomic dysfunction, and altered olfactory function. The pathophysiology of these symptoms is related to alteration of the cholinergic tone in the striatum and/or to degeneration of cholinergic nuclei, most importantly the nucleus basalis magnocellularis and the pedunculopontine nucleus. Several results suggest the clinical usefulness of antimuscarinic drugs for treating PD motor symptoms and of inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase for the treatment of dementia. Data also suggest that these inhibitors and pedunculopontine nucleus deep-brain stimulation might also be effective in preventing falls. Finally, several drugs acting on nicotinic receptors have proved efficacious for treating levodopa-induced dyskinesias and cognitive impairment and as neuroprotective agents in PD animal models. Results in human patients are still lacking.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a serious and potentially fatal adverse effect of antipsychotic drugs. The diagnosis of NMS commonly requires core symptoms of hyperthermia and muscle rigidity. Although diagnostic criteria for NMS have been established and are widely accepted and used, it should be recognized that atypical presentations pose a diagnostic dilemma, as hyperthermia and/or muscle rigidity may be absent or develop slowly over several days, leading to impairment or a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment. Evidence from case reports and retrospective evaluations supports a concept of atypical NMS, particularly with regard to treatment with atypical antipsychotics. However, it remains unclear whether these atypical presentations represent early or impending NMS. Furthermore, it is unclear whether dysfunction in other neurotransmitter systems, in addition to dopamine, may be involved in the pathogenesis of NMS induced by atypical antipsychotics. In patients receiving any antipsychotic, clinicians should carefully evaluate any features of NMS and should not prematurely exclude a diagnosis of NMS in cases where severe rigidity or hyperthermia is not initially apparent.",

The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "abstract": "Disadvantageous decision-making and impaired volitional control over actions, thoughts, and emotions are characteristics of a wide range of mental disorders such as addiction, eating disorders, depression, and anxiety disorders and may reflect transdiagnostic core mechanisms and possibly vulnerability factors. Elucidating the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms is a precondition for moving from symptom-based to mechanism-based disorder classifications and ultimately mechanism-targeted interventions. However, despite substantial advances in basic research on decision-making and cognitive control, there are still profound gaps in our current understanding of dysfunctions of these processes in mental disorders. Central unresolved questions are: (i) to which degree such dysfunctions reflect transdiagnostic mechanisms or disorder-specific patterns of impairment; (ii) how phenotypical features of mental disorders relate to dysfunctional control parameter settings and aberrant interactions between large-scale brain systems involved in habit and reward-based learning, performance monitoring, emotion regulation, and cognitive control; (iii) whether cognitive control impairments are consequences or antecedent vulnerability factors of mental disorders; (iv) whether they reflect generalized competence impairments or context-specific performance failures; (v) whether not only impaired but also chronic over-control contributes to mental disorders. In the light of these gaps, needs for future research are: (i) an increased focus on basic cognitive-affective mechanisms underlying decision and control dysfunctions across disorders; (ii) longitudinal-prospective studies systematically incorporating theory-driven behavioural tasks and neuroimaging protocols to assess decision-making and control dysfunctions and aberrant interactions between underlying large-scale brain systems; (iii) use of latent-variable models of cognitive control rather than single tasks; (iv) increased focus on the interplay of implicit and explicit cognitive-affective processes; (v) stronger focus on computational models specifying neurocognitive mechanisms underlying phenotypical expressions of mental disorders.",

Pain, cramping, and gastrointestinal complaints frequently accompany weakness. The collagen-vascular diseases and inflammatory myopathies are likely to produce myalgia and muscle tenderness. The degree of weakness is assessed for each muscle group; serial examinations can provide evidence of improvement or worsening in the condition. This chapter provides differential diagnosis for specific conditions such as cerebral hemispheric lesions, spinal cord disorders, anterior horn cell disorders, nerve root disorders, neuromuscular junction disorders, and myopathies. In the emergency department, the most serious presentation of severe muscle weakness is acute respiratory failure. The three most common primary neurological causes of acute respiratory failure are previously unrecognized amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myasthenia gravis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Respiratory failure due to a neuromuscular cause is a form of restrictive pulmonary disease.",

      "abstract": "The 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is one of the most common genomic disorders in humans. There is an increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in individuals with 22q11DS. The characteristic motor features of PD begin when more than 50% of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have degenerated. Before this, there is a prodromal period, of up to 20 years, in which nonmotor features such as hyposmia, autonomic dysfunction, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and subtle motor dysfunction can occur. We used validated clinical tools to investigate the presence of prodromal markers of PD in 50 adults with 22q11DS and 14 matched deletion-negative controls. The median score on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test was significantly lower in the 22q11 deletion group, and 44% scored in the hyposmic range (P=0.024). Individuals with 22q11DS were significantly more likely to report autonomic symptoms (urinary dysfunction or constipation, P=0.016). Twenty-eight percent of 22q11DS participants scored above the threshold for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder on a screening questionnaire (P=0.022). Four 22q11DS participants had parkinsonian motor signs on examination, which did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for PD. We report prodromal markers of PD in 22q11DS. These may help identify individuals with 22q11 deletion at risk of neurological disease. However, the significance of these signs needs to be confirmed by longitudinal studies of development of PD.",

As a disease which directly affects brain cells, it may cause severe psychological and physiological dysfunctions in some of its victims. The principal psychological effects consist of cognitive and affective disturbances. Among cognitive deficites are memory loss and severe difficulty in conceptual reasoning. These deficits are likely to deprive the person affected by the disease of the ability to understand, reason, and elicit deliberate choice. Severe emotional disturbance indicative of a substantial change in personality. Such a change in personality may incapacitate multiple sclerosis victims in several aspects of their intrapsychic and interpersonal life. In marital relationship, a person may be rendered incapable of fulfilling the essential obligations of marriage. The physiological effects which have important juridic consequences are in the area of sexual dysfunctions. If these effects are present at the time of exchanging consent, a marriage court may have to look for possible functional impotence. If the dysfunction becomes evident after the marriage, the only approach seems to be to investigate the possibility of incapacity to assume the perpetuity of the right to sexual intercourse. If this approach is adopted, the basis for this incapacity is to be found in c. 1095, 3°, which requires that the cause of incapacity to assume the essential obligations of marriage be „psychic” in nature. The fact that someone has been diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis does not constitute definitive basis for the juridic conclusion that such a person is inept for or incapable of contracting marriage. The disease affects each person differently and, hence, interpatient variability with regard to physiological effects is inevitable. Therefore, all patients cannot be regarded as lacking in discretion of judgement and/or in their capacity to assume the essential obligations of marriage. Each case is unique and, therefore, each case must be investigated under an appropriate caput or capita nullitatis according to its particular circumstances.",

The similarity of her symptoms to neurologic disease was so striking that battering continued undetected until she finally showed external bruises. Neurologic findings, which included exaggerated startle, hyperreflexia, and increased muscle tone, were not due to organic neurologic disease, and all disappeared within 1 week after hospital admission. The battered child syndrome must be included in the differential diagnosis of developmental failure with diffuse or nonfocal neurologic signs; and, all infants who show these symptoms should be hospitalized.",

      "abstract": "A task force to develop guidelines for diagnostic evaluation and treatment of sleep disorders in degenerative neurological disorders and stroke was initiated by the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS). The aims were to provide evidence-based recommendations in the management of sleep disorders associated with degenerative neurologic disorders and stroke. Neurological patients often have significant sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders (SBD), insomnia, sleep-related motor and rapid eye movement behavioural disorders affecting nocturnal sleep and daytime function. A polysomnography (PSG) is usually a diagnostic minimum for the diagnosis of the most commonly reported sleep disorders in patients with neurological diseases. A full video-PSG/video-EEG-PSG should be considered in patients with nocturnal motor and/behavioural manifestations. Respiratory polygraphy has a moderate sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of SBD without neurologic diseases, but its value in patients with neurological diseases has not been evaluated. Oximetry has a poor sensitivity-specificity for the identification of SDB. Continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure devices are the most effective treatment of SDB in patients with neurologic diseases. There is a need for further studies focusing on the diagnostic procedures and treatment modalities in patients with sleep disorders and degenerative neurologic diseases and stroke.",

O termo transitorio e usado como demarcador de tempo, para inicio e fim da crise. A crise neonatal constitui-se a mais frequente manifestacao de disfuncao neurologica no recem-nascido, com maior incidencia no primeiro ano de vida, e apresenta risco de morte, lesao neuronal, morte neuronal, alteracoes de redes neuronais ou prejuizos neurologicos e cognitivos de longo prazo dependendo do tipo de duracao da crise. Entretanto, cerca de 40%-50% das criancas afetadas se desenvolvem normalmente. Estudos em modelos animais demonstram que as convulsoes neonatais em roedores produzem efeitos adversos neurologicos de longo prazo, tais como: deficits na aprendizagem, memoria visuo-espacial, prejuizo na flexibilidade cognitiva, comportamento autista, caracterizado pela baixa preferencia pela novidade social, deficit de discriminacao social e comportamento tipo ansioso. Com base no conjunto de alteracoes desencadeadas pelas crises neonatais em roedores, o modelo pode ser util para a investigacao da relacao entre as convulsoes no inicio do desenvolvimento e as funcoes executivas. Assim, este projeto pretende avaliar comportamentos relacionados as funcoes executivas de animais que foram expostos ao SE neonatal. Ratos Wistar machos ao nono dia de vida (P9) foram submetidos ao SE pela administracao da policarpina (350 mg/kg, ip) e os controles receberam salina 0,9% (0,1 mL/10 g). Em P60 os animais foram avaliados pelos seguintes paradigmas: a caixa de condicionamento operante e o labirinto em T. A amostra foi composta por 25 animais, 11 controles e 14 experimentais. Estes testes avaliam: aprendizagem associativa visuo-espacial, consolidacao da memoria, memoria de trabalho, comportamento perseverante, controle inibitorio e flexibilidade comportamental. Os dados sugerem que o grupo experimental, na caixa de condicionamento operante, nao exibiu prejuizo na aprendizagem associativa visuo-espacial, que houve a consolidacao da memoria, nao apresentou comportamento perseverante, prejuizo na memoria de trabalho e nem comportamento perseverante. No labirinto em T o grupo experimental mantiveram preservadas a memoria de trabalho, a memoria de referencia e motivacao, e nao exibiram prejuizo na flexibilidade comportamental.

      "title": "Beta-Propeller Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is typically characterized by early-onset seizures, infantile-onset developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent to limited expressive language, motor dysfunction (ataxia), and abnormal behaviors often similar to autism spectrum disorder. Seizure types including generalized (absence, tonic, atonic, tonic-clonic and myoclonic), focal with impaired consciousness, and epileptic spasms, as well as epileptic syndromes (West syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) can be seen. With age seizures tend to resolve or become less prominent, whereas cognitive decline and movement disorders (progressive parkinsonism and dystonia) emerge as characteristic findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of BPAN is established by identifying on molecular genetic testing: In females. A heterozygous WDR45 germline pathogenic variant; In males. Either a hemizygous WDR45 pathogenic variant or partial deletion of WDR45. Somatic mosaicism has been reported in rare females (and possibly in 1 male). Management Treatment of manifestations: Seizure management, tailored to the individual, may include antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), ketogenic diet, and/or vagus nerve stimulation. Developmental delays and intellectual disability are managed in infancy and early childhood with early intervention programs and in school-age children with individual education programs. Consultation with a developmental pediatrician to ensure appropriate services is recommended. Discussion about transition plans including financial, vocation/employment, and medical arrangements should begin at age 12 years. Consider alternative means of communication, such as an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) program, for individuals who have expressive language difficulties. Motor dysfunction in childhood is managed with physical therapy to maximize mobility and to reduce the risk for later-onset orthopedic complications (e.g., contractures, scoliosis, hip dislocation). Occupational therapy may aid in writing, feeding, grooming, and dressing. For those with feeding difficulties, feeding therapy may be considered. For individuals with social/behavioral difficulties, consider applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy, medical management strategies in conjunction with a developmental specialist, and pediatric psychiatry consultation to address aggressive or destructive behaviors. In adolescents/adults with parkinsonism, dystonia, and spasticity, the usual pharmacologic agents can be considered with the caveat that these therapies could exacerbate the cognitive deficits that also occur in this age group. Children with abnormal behaviors may qualify for and benefit from interventions used in treatment of autism spectrum disorder. Surveillance: Routine follow up by a neurologist for medication management and interval assessment of ambulation, seizure activity, speech, and evidence of swallowing dysfunction. For those receiving dopaminergic drugs (for parkinsonism), monitor for adverse neuropsychiatric effects and disabling motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Pregnancy management: Use of AEDs during pregnancy for women with a seizure disorder is generally recommended, despite an increased risk for adverse fetal outcome associated with some AEDs. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given antiepileptic medication during pregnancy ideally should take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication may be possible. Genetic counseling BPAN is inherited in an X-linked manner; to date, most affected individuals have been female, and the vast majority are simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) resulting from a de novo WDR45 pathogenic variant. The exceptions include two familial cases, one with presumed maternal germline mosaicism and one with transmission of a WDR45 pathogenic variant by a phenotypically normal mother who demonstrated significantly skewed X-chromosome inactivation. Females with the typical BPAN phenotype do not reproduce. In rare instances, a female who is mildly affected may reproduce. Affected males do not reproduce. Once the WDR45 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for BPAN are possible.",

Each boy presented in early infancy with visual unresponsiveness, which spontaneously resolved. This delayed visual maturation was accompanied or followed by severe autistic impairment, general developmental delay, hypotonia and clumsiness. Subsequent progress has been unexpectedly favourable, with striking improvements in language, play, social interest and social competence. Widespread, patchy delay in brain maturation could possibly account for this combination of delayed visual maturation and autism, with a good prognosis. RÉSUMÉ Maturation visuelle retardée et autisme L'article décrit trois garcons présentant un désordre développemental complexe, avec jusqu'à ce jourun relativement bon pronostic. Chaque garcon avait présenté durant la première enfance une absence de réponse visuelle, ayant disparue spontanément par la suite. Ce retard de maturation visuelle s'accompagnait de troubles autistiques sévères, d'un retard global de maturation, d'une hypotonie et d'une maladresse. Les progrès ultérieurs ont étè favorables de facon inattendue, avec une amélioration frappante du langage, du jeu, de I'intérèt et de la compétence sociale. Un retard de maturation cérébrate, avec des localisations précises et en grand nombre, pourrait expliquer cette association de retard de maturation visuelle et d'autisme, avec bon pronostic. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Verzögerte visuelle Reifung und Autismus Es werden drei Jungen mit einer mehrschichtigen Entwicklungsstörung beschrieben, die, soweit man das bisher beurteilen kann, eine relativ gute Prognose zu haben scheint. Im fruhen Kindesalter zeigten die Jungen keine Reaktion auf visuelle Reize, was sich spontan änderte. Diese verzögerte visuelle Reifung war begleitet Oder gefolgt von schweren autistischen Symptomen, allgemeinen Entwicklungsverzögerungen, Hypotonie und Ungeschicklichkeit. Der weitere Entwicklungsfortschritt war unerwartet gut, mit bemerkenswerten Besserungen in Sprache, Spiel, sozialen Interessen und sozialem Verhalten. Eine ausgedehnte fleckige Hirnreifungsverzögerung könnte die Ursache fur diese Kombination von verzögerter visueller Reifung und Autismus mit guter Prognose sein.

Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, facial apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational [IA] and ideomotor apraxias [IMA]), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia [LKA]), or alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "title": "Anti-CNTN-1 autoimmune nodopathies with dysarthria at onset - a case report and literature review",
      "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND: Anti-CNTN-1 autoimmune nodopathies (AN) is a new and rare diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy proposed by the European Society of Neurology in recent years. Clinical manifestations usually include chronic, subacute or rapidly progressive sensory or motor disorders, sensory ataxia, tremor, and cranial nerve involvement (facial paralysis, eye movement limitation, diplopia, etc. However, anti-CNTN-1 autoimmune nodopathies with dysarthria have rarely been reported. We report a rare young case with dysarthria. Case introduction: This is a case of a 25-year-old male patient with an initial onset of dysarthria and limb tremor. He was initially misdiagnosed withspinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), and the symptoms gradually worsened, including limb weakness, sensory disorders of the limbs, muscle atrophy of the distal lower limbs, and positional dizziness. Neuroelectrophysiological examination showed multiple peripheral nerve damage (motor and sensory damage), and the myelin sheath and axons were involved (mainly the myelin sheath). The blood and cerebrospinal fluid of peripheral neuropathy autoimmune antibody tests indicated that anti-CNTN-1 antibody, the serum GD1b antibody was positive, and a corrected diagnosis of CNTN-1 autoimmune nodopathies. The patient was treated with rituximab, and limb weakness and dysarthria were improved after 3 months of follow-up. Conclusion: Compared with the previously reported cases of anti-CNTN-1 AN, the cases we describe are young patients with dysarthria and limb tremor, highlighting the possibility of this disease presenting as unconventional peripheral nerve onset. We hope this article will improve clinicians' awareness of this kind of disease and reduce the misdiagnosis rate of this disease to help patients diagnose and treat it in time.",

      "title": "The Evolution of Negative Symptom Constructs",
      "abstract": "Introduction Negative symptoms represent a separate dimension of schizophrenia psychopathology, distinct from positive symptoms, disorganization and cognitive impairment. It is increasingly acknowledged that negative symptoms are associated with poor functional outcome and represent an unmet need in schizophrenia treatment. Improvement in definition of their phenomenology, assessment instruments and experimental models are needed in order to improve schizophrenia prognosis. Aims The presentation will review key aspects of the evolution of negative symptom constructs. In particular, findings concerning phenomenology, clinical assessment, association with functional outcome and brain imaging correlates will be presented. Methods We searched PubMed for English full-text publications with the keywords Schizophrenia AND “negative symptoms”/“primary negative symptoms”/“deficit schizophrenia”/“persistent negative symptoms”/“affective flattening”/alogia/“expressive deficit”/apathy/asociality/“social withdrawal”/anhedonia/“anticipatory anhedonia”/avolition/neuroimaging. Results The distinction between secondary negative symptoms (i.e., those due to identifiable factors, such as drug effects, psychotic symptoms or depression), and primary or persistent negative symptoms (i.e., those etiologically related to the core pathophysiology of schizophrenia) is grounded on solid research evidence and might have major implications for both treatment development and clinical care. The evidence that negative symptoms cluster in motivation- and expressive-related domains is founded on large consensus and empirical evidence and will foster pathophysiological modeling. The motivation-related domain is a stronger predictor of functional outcome than the expressive one. Conclusions An improved definition and assessment of negative symptoms needs to translate in large-scale studies to advance knowledge. In the short-term, the improved identification of treatable causes of secondary negative symptoms can translate into better care for people with schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "Neuroacanthocytosis is an inclusive term for a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the association of neurological abnormalities with red cell acanthocytosis. In the late 1960s, Levine et al. reported a family with a syndrome of neurological deficits such as choreiform involuntary movements, epileptic seizures, intellectual impairment, and paranoid ideation along with acanthocytosis without any disturbance in either alpha- or beta-lipoproteins nor retinitis pigmentosa. Critchley et al. also reported familial cases with acanthocytosis and neurological disorders without beta-lipoproteinemia. These cases have been classified as the Levine-Critchley syndrome of neuroacanthocytosis. Cases of neuroacanthocytosis have been classified into 2 groups depending on the presence or absence of movement disorders such as chorea. One group comprises the core neuroacanthocytosis syndromes in which neurodegeneration occurs primarily in the basal ganglia, specifically the striatum, causing movement disorders. The core neuroacanthocytosis syndromes mainly comprise of the two diseases, chorea-acanthocytosis and the McLeod syndrome. Huntington's disease-like 2, and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) are very rare but these diseases can also be included in this group of syndromes. Advances in molecular genetics have enabled us to distinguish between these diseases. Recently, the hypoprebetalipoproteinemia, acanthocytosis, retinitis pigmentosa and pallidal degeneration syndrome (HARP syndrome) has been genetically shown to be an allelic form of PKAN. The second group of neuroacanthocytosis syndromes includes abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig disease) and hypobetalipoproteinemia that are characterized by the abnormal decay of lipoprotein with the intestinal malabsorption of fat leading to neurological abnormalities and acanthocytosis. In this type of neuroacanthocytosis shows a progressive spinocerebellar ataxia with peripheral neuropathy and retinitis pigmentosa are observed, but movement disorders are not seen.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

Many cognitive functions may be concerned and can be explained by fronto-striatal brain circuits and hippocampus dysfunctions partly through abnormalities related to cerebrovascular diseases. It seems important to distinguish between early and late onset depression whose cognitive characterisation and etiopathogenia differ in some aspects. Cognitive impairment may represent markers of depression but it is still unclear whether one should consider potential biomarkers of disease state or trait or risk factor. These disorders may precede depression and persist despite symptomatic remission. Moreover, the interest of specifying these disorders is multiple because they can have pejorative consequences such as the modification of emotional content, promote suicidal act, limit the effectiveness of psychotherapy, be a risk factor for poor response to antidepressants. or be a potential risk factor for progression to a minor or major neurocognitive disorder, especially Alzheimer's disease.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathies, excluding those caused by mechanical damage, are most commonly associated with infection, autoimmune disorders, and exposure to neurotoxins or metabolic disease. The sensory nervous system may be selectively damaged, as occurs in platinum toxicity, or there may be a more generalized sensorimotor neuropathy. Symptoms of sensory dysfunction range from sensory loss to inappropriate or exaggerated pain perception and a variety of sensory disorders may occur together or in chronological sequence. For example, while sensory loss is the predominant symptom of diabetic polyneuropathy, 5-10% of patients exhibit a painful neuropathy that may either precede or co-exist with sensory loss. Pain, paresthesias or dysesthesias are a common feature of many peripheral neuropathies but are difficult to quantify in animal models. It is particularly unfortunate that both leprosy and HIV have proven extremely difficult to model in animals that lend themselves to experimental studies of nociceptive processing. As a result, little is yet known of the mechanisms that produce these most prevalent of neuropathies. In recent years, sensory dysfunction has been described in animal models of chemical neurotoxicity and diabetes mellitus. Such models are of value as they allow investigation of the etiology of neuropathic pain and because they provide test systems in which to study potential therapeutic agents that may prevent or ameliorate neuropathic pain. In this chapter we will briefly consider the animal models of toxic neuropathies, which largely produce sensory loss, and then focus upon data obtained from the widely studied animal models of diabetic neuropathy.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nOptic neuritis is an inflammation of optic nerve. Based on\r\nclinical examination it is classified into retrobulbar neuritis, papillitis or neuroretinitis. Etiology is multifactorial. The usual triad of symptoms consist of ipsilateral eye pain, vision loss and dyschromatopsia. Clinical signs include reduced visual acuity, dyschromatopsia, altered contrast sensitivity, afferent pupillary defect, visual field defects, optic disc and retinal changes. 25% - 30% is usually found associated with Multiple sclerosis. MRI remains the imaging modality of choice in diagnosing and in assessing the visual outcome in optic neuritis. More data is provided by Diffusion-weighted and diffusion-tensor imaging on treatment and/or on prognosis. The loss of anisotropy manifested by an increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient or associated with demyelination and/or axonal damage may be more sensitive and/or yield more prognostic information than anatomic imaging findings. The shortcoming of diffusion -weighted and diffusion-tensor imaging of the optic nerves are that it is too time consuming. The main stay of treatment in optic neuritis based on ONTT (Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial) is corticosteroids both intravenous and oral at present, although newer treatment modalities are underway.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nTo determine that Diffusion weighted imaging can be used as a predictor of visual outcome in patients with Acute optic neuritis at a tertiary eye care Centre in Southern India.\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\n1. To detect acute optic neuritis by MRI. \r\n2. To determine that DWI can be used as a predictor of visual outcome in acute optic neuritis. \r\n3. To determine the specificity of Diffusion restriction, contrast enhancement and ADC in detecting acute optic neuritis. \r\nMETHODOLOGY:\r\nIt is a hospital based prospective, observational study. 31 eyes of 28 patients with acute optic neuritis who attended the hospital between December 2015 and\r\nDecember November 16 was statistically analysed, with a follow up period of 3\r\nmonths.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nMean age was 34 ±10.27 (SD) years. The mean duration of onset of symptoms was 9.11 days ± 6.95 (SD). 64.3% of the patients were females. Left eye was involved in 15 cases (60%). Defective vision was the main complaint in 31 eyes (100%). RAPD was found in 28 eyes. At baseline presentation optic disc showed\r\ndisc edema in 70.9% of eyes. Colour vision, brightness sensitivity, red desaturation which were abnormal in a majority of patients showed good improvement in significant number of patients post treatment. Median LogMAR at baseline was 1.32 ± 0.86 which improved to 0.14 ± 0.24. After 3 months after treatment with intravenous and oral steroids as recommended by optic neuritis treatment trial. In Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) diffusion was restricted in 83.9% eyes, contrast was enhanced in 83.9% eyes, optic nerve diameter was increased in 87%and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was reduced in 83.9% eyes at baseline. These eyes showed good prognosis at 3 months follow up compared to eyes which had no diffusion restriction, no contrast enhancement and increased ADC.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nDiffusion weighted imaging (DWI) adds value in predicting the visual outcome in acute optic neuritis.",

Visual attention deficit is sometimes described as blurry vision. Migraine auras often cause visual impairment. The chapter suggests modes of treatment for these situations. Paroxysmal changes in vision after concussion should be treated as presumptive migraine, or migraine equivalent even if there is no severe headache.

The disorders that are often observed during the night in PD include sleep fragmentation that may be due to recurrent PD symptoms, sleep apnea, Restless Leg Syndrome/periodic limb movements and REM sleep behavior disorder. Excessive daytime sleepiness is also a common occurrence in PD. EDS can arise from several etiologies, and patients may have more than one etiology responsible. The causes of EDS include nocturnal sleep disorder with sleep deprivation and resulting daytime somnolence, the effect of drugs used to treat PD, and possibly neurodegeneration of central sleep/wake areas. Appropriate diagnosis of the sleep disturbance affecting a PD patient can lead to specific treatments that can consolidate nocturnal sleep and enhance daytime alertness.",

      "abstract": "Lewy bodies (LBs) are intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusions sometimes found in the brain stem, diencephalon, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex. Cases designated as diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) demonstrate widespread cortical and subcortical Lewy body formation. The fact that DLBD is possibly the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease is not generally recognized. We hope to emphasize the importance of this common neurodegenerative disorder by reviewing the literature and our own experience with DLBD. The English-language literature dealing with the clinical and pathological features of DLBD was reviewed. Pathological material from the Canadian Brain Tissue Bank, Toronto, Ontario, was reviewed over a 2-year period from 1991 through 1993. Prominent LB pathology may occur in isolation or mixed with pathological changes seen in Alzheimer's disease. Lewy body diseases include Parkinson's disease that presents with a classic movement disorder and sometimes dementia, and DLBD where LBs occur in a widespread distribution in the cortex in addition to the usual subcortical sites. Diffuse LB disease usually presents with a neurobehavioral syndrome that may include hallucinations, delusions, and psychosis; all patients eventually become demented. A day-to-day fluctuating mental state may be an important distinguishing clinical feature. Parkinsonism may follow the psychiatric disturbance although occasionally it is a presenting feature. Serious life- threatening side effects may occur with the use of standard neuroleptics. The variable clinical features and additional presence of Alzheimer-type pathological changes in many cases of DLBD has led to a confusing and inconsistent classification of LB disease and, together with little awareness of its existence, its misdiagnosis. Although DLBD may be the second most common cause of dementia, the terminology and classification of LB disorders and their relationship to Alzheimer's disease remain sources of intense debate. Further research is needed to resolve these issues and to provide insight into the pathogenesis of LB formation and accompanying neuronal degeneration.",

      "abstract": "Dementia represents decline in cognitive functioning which interferes with working ability and social skills. Dementia can be divided in two categories, reversible and irreversible dementia, depending on what was the cause of illness. Since symptoms of dementia are overlapping with symptoms of depression and delirium (both treatable conditions), one should be careful when diagnosing dementia. Most common and most important type of irreversible dementia is Alzheimer’s dementia. Aggregation of senile plaques and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins are still in focus when talking about the pathophysiology of the disease. The increase of oxidative stress and therefore changes in functioning of neurons both lead to neurological decline. Progressive decline in cognitive functioning, inability to perform everyday activities, behavioral changes and dependence on help of family members or medical personnel are some of the symptoms of dementia. Significant cognitive deprivation in the majority of diseased can lead to behavioral impairment. People with dementia are prone to delusions and hallucinations, which makes their treatment quite challenging. Since there is no cure for dementia, only symptomatolitic remedies are being used. These drugs reduce symptoms of dementia, but also delay admission to nursing homes. Currently used drugs are NMDA receptor antagonist memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors- rivastigmin, galantamin and donepezil. Memantine decreases impact of glutamate on oxidative stress of neurons and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors restore loss of cholinergic pathways by inhibiting breakdown of acetylcholine in synaptic cleft. Behavioral and psychotic symptoms are treated with antipsychotics and benzodiazepines.",

There are, however, some peculiarities that are typical of cardiac and skeletal muscle disorders. Skeletal muscle weakness presenting at any age may indicate a primary neuromuscular disorder (associated with creatine kinase elevation as in dystrophinopathies), a mitochondrial disease (particularly if encephalopathy, ocular myopathy, retinitis, neurosensorineural deafness, lactic acidosis are present), a storage disorder (progressive exercise intolerance, cognitive impairment and retinitis pigmentosa, as in Danon disease), or metabolic disorders (hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperammonaemia or other specific biochemical abnormalities). In such patients, skeletal muscle weakness usually precedes the cardiomyopathy and dominates the clinical picture. Nevertheless, skeletal involvement may be subtle, and the first clinical manifestation of a neuromuscular disorder may be the occurrence of heart failure, conduction disorders or ventricular arrhythmias due to cardiomyopathy. ECG and echocardiogram, and eventually, a more detailed cardiovascular evaluation may be required to identify early cardiac involvement. Paediatric and adult cardiologists should be proactive in screening for neuromuscular and related disorders to enable diagnosis in probands and evaluation of families with a focus on the identification of those at risk of cardiac arrhythmia and emboli who may require specific prophylactic treatments, for example, pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and anticoagulation.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is essential for various cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes, including attention, memory, executive function, emotional regulation, and interpersonal interactions. Sleep disruptions undermine these functions, resulting in measurable impairments in daily activities, occupational performance, and public safety. Adequate sleep supports sustained vigilance and concentration, whereas sleep deprivation is associated with attentional lapses, diminished cognitive control, and impaired sensory processing. Memory consolidation, which depends on both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, is particularly susceptible to disruption by sleep loss. Executive functions, such as working memory, impulse control, and decision-making, are notably impaired due to the prefrontal cortex's heightened sensitivity to insufficient sleep. Sleep deprivation increases amygdala reactivity, weakens prefrontal-amygdala connectivity, and contributes to emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors. Chronic sleep deprivation exacerbates cognitive deficits, emotional instability, and motor performance decline, leading to higher error rates and reduced workplace productivity. Given its widespread consequences, chronic sleep deprivation constitutes a significant public health concern. This narrative review synthesizes contemporary research on the effects of sleep and sleep loss on waking behavior, with a focus on attention, memory, executive function, emotional regulation, and daytime performance.",

      "title": "Binocular rivalry and visuospatial ability in individuals with schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Visual abnormalities, both at the sensory input and the higher interpretive levels, have been associated with many of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia typically experience distortions of sensory perception, resulting in perceptual hallucinations and delusions that are related to the observed visual deficits. Disorganised speech, thinking and behaviour are commonly experienced by sufferers of the disorder, and have also been attributed to perceptual disturbances associated with anomalies in visual processing. Compounding these issues are marked deficits in cognitive functioning that are observed in approximately 80% of those with schizophrenia. Cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia include: difficulty with concentration and memory (i.e. working, visual and verbal), an impaired ability to process complex information, response inhibition and deficits in speed of processing, visual and verbal learning. Deficits in sustained attention or vigilance, poor executive functioning such as poor reasoning, problem solving, and social cognition, are all influenced by impaired visual processing. These symptoms impact on the internal perceptual world of those with schizophrenia, and hamper their ability to navigate their external environment. Visual processing abnormalities in schizophrenia are likely to worsen personal, social and occupational functioning.\r\n\r\nBinocular rivalry provides a unique opportunity to investigate the processes involved in visual awareness and visual perception. Binocular rivalry is the alternation of perceptual images that occurs when conflicting visual stimuli are presented to each eye in the same retinal location. The observer perceives the opposing images in an alternating fashion, despite the sensory input to each eye remaining constant. Binocular rivalry tasks have been developed to investigate specific parts of the visual system. The research presented in this Thesis provides an explorative investigation into binocular rivalry in schizophrenia, using the method of Pettigrew and Miller (1998) and comparing individuals with schizophrenia to healthy controls. This method allows manipulations to the spatial and temporal frequency, luminance contrast and chromaticity of the visual stimuli. Manipulations to the rival stimuli affect the rate of binocular rivalry alternations and the time spent perceiving each image (dominance duration). Binocular rivalry rate and dominance durations provide useful measures to investigate aspects of visual neural processing that lead to the perceptual disturbances and cognitive dysfunction attributed to schizophrenia. However, despite this promise the binocular rivalry phenomenon has not been extensively explored in schizophrenia to date.\r\n\r\nFollowing a review of the literature, the research in this Thesis examined individual variation in binocular rivalry. The initial study (Chapter 2) explored the effect of systematically altering the properties of the stimuli (i.e. spatial and temporal frequency, luminance contrast and chromaticity) on binocular rivalry rate and dominance durations in healthy individuals (n=20). The findings showed that altering the stimuli with respect to temporal frequency and luminance contrast significantly affected rate. This is significant as processing of temporal frequency and luminance contrast have consistently been demonstrated to be abnormal in schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nThe current research then explored binocular rivalry in schizophrenia. The primary research question was, Are binocular rivalry rates and dominance durations recorded in participants with schizophrenia different to those of the controls? In this second study binocular rivalry data that were collected using low- and highstrength binocular rivalry were compared to alternations recorded during a monocular rivalry task, the Necker Cube task to replicate and advance the work of Miller et al., (2003). Participants with schizophrenia (n=20) recorded fewer alternations (i.e. slower alternation rates) than control participants (n=20) on both binocular rivalry tasks, however no difference was observed between the groups on the Necker cube task.\r\n\r\nMagnocellular and parvocellular visual pathways, thought to be abnormal in schizophrenia, were also investigated in binocular rivalry. The binocular rivalry stimuli used in this third study (Chapter 4) were altered to bias the task for one of these two pathways. Participants with schizophrenia recorded slower binocular rivalry rates than controls in both binocular rivalry tasks. Using a ‘within subject design’, binocular rivalry data were compared to data collected from a backwardmasking task widely accepted to bias both these pathways. Based on these data, a model of binocular rivalry, based on the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways that contribute to the dorsal and ventral visual streams, was developed.\r\n\r\nBinocular rivalry rates were compared with performance on the Benton’s Judgment of Line Orientation task, in individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls (Chapter 5). The Benton’s Judgment of Line Orientation task is widely accepted to be processed within the right cerebral hemisphere, making it an appropriate task to investigate the role of the cerebral hemispheres in binocular rivalry, and to investigate the inter-hemispheric switching hypothesis of binocular rivalry proposed by Pettigrew and Miller (1998, 2003). The data were suggestive of intra-hemispheric rather than an inter-hemispheric visual processing in binocular rivalry.\r\n\r\nNeurotransmitter involvement in binocular rivalry, backward masking and Judgment of Line Orientation in schizophrenia were investigated using a genetic indicator of dopamine receptor distribution and functioning; the presence of the Taq1 allele of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) receptor gene. This final study (Chapter 6) explored whether the presence of the Taq1 allele of the DRD2 receptor gene, and thus, by inference the distribution of dopamine receptors and dopamine function, accounted for the large individual variation in binocular rivalry. The presence of the Taq1 allele was associated with slower binocular rivalry rates or poorer performance in the backward masking and Judgment of Line Orientation tasks seen in the group with schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nThis Thesis has contributed to what is known about binocular rivalry in schizophrenia. Consistently slower binocular rivalry rates were observed in participants with schizophrenia, indicating abnormally-slow visual processing in this group. These data support previous studies reporting visual processing abnormalities in schizophrenia and suggest that a slow binocular rivalry rate is not a feature specific to bipolar disorder, but may be a feature of disorders with psychotic features generally.\r\n\r\nThe contributions of the magnocellular or dorsal pathways and parvocellular or ventral pathways to binocular rivalry, and therefore to perceptual awareness, were investigated. The data presented supported the view that the magnocellular system initiates perceptual awareness of an image and the parvocellular system maintains the perception of the image, making it available to higher level processing occurring within the cortical hemispheres. Abnormal magnocellular and parvocellular processing may both contribute to perceptual disturbances that ultimately contribute to the cognitive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia. An alternative model of binocular rivalry based on these observations was proposed.",

Use of one cognitive reasoning style over the other has broad implications for beliefs, but differences in cognitive style have not previously been reported in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Here, the cognitive reflection test is used to measure cognitive style in healthy older adults and those with MCI. Those with MCI performed worse than cognitively healthy older adults, indicating they are more likely to engage in intuitive thinking than age-matched adults. This association is reliable after controlling for additional cognitive, self-report, and demographic factors. Across all measures, subjective cognitive decline was the best predictor of cognitive status. A difference in cognitive style represents a novel behavioral marker of MCI, and future work should explore whether this explains a broader pattern of reasoning errors in those with MCI, such as susceptibility to scams or impaired financial reasoning.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To critically review contemporary theoretical models, diagnostic approaches, clinical features, and assessment findings in Functional Cognitive Disorder (FCD), and make recommendations for neuropsychological evaluation of this condition. Method: Narrative review. Results: FCD is common in neuropsychological practice. It is characterized by cognitive symptoms that are not better explained by another medical or psychiatric disorder. The cognitive symptoms are associated with distress and/or limitations in daily functioning, but are potentially reversible with appropriate identification and treatment. Historically, a variety of diagnostic frameworks have attempted to capture this condition. A contemporary conceptualization of FCD positions it as a subtype of Functional Neurological Disorder, with shared and unique etiological factors. Patients with FCD tend to perform normally on neuropsychological testing or demonstrate relatively weak memory acquisition (e.g. list learning trials) in comparison to strong attention and delayed recall performance. Careful history-taking and behavioral observations are essential to support the diagnosis of FCD. Areas of ongoing controversy include operationalizing \"internal inconsistencies\" and the role of performance validity testing. Evidence for targeted interventions remains scarce. Conclusions: Neuropsychologists familiar with FCD can uniquely contribute to the care of patients with this condition by improving diagnostic clarity, richening case formulation, communicating effectively with referrers, and leading clinical management. Further research is needed to refine diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegeneration associated with pantothenate kinase deficiency is a rare disease. To confirm its diagnosis, studies are needed that are often not available in all countries and times (as in this case). Clinical case: In the Child Psychiatry ward of the \"Juan Manuel Márquez\" Pediatric Hospital, an adolescent was treated with psychiatric disorders of psychotic functioning level with little response to treatment, extrapyramidal manifestations and other progressive neurological dysfunction. The classic image of \"tiger eyes\" was evidenced by magnetic resonance imaging of the skull, at the beginning unilateral, and at 10 months it was performed again, verifying the bilateral image, in addition to significant cognitive, language, communication and loss of skills deterioration. With regression, affective symptoms and sleep disorder. Conclusions: Although neurodegeneration associated with pantothenate kinase deficiency is a rare disease and in the present case it could only be considered probable, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of children and adolescents with the progression of clinical manifestations, including extrapyramidal dysfunction. dementia, even in the absence of a tiger-eye image at the onset of manifestations or its unilateral presence. Psychiatric manifestations were the cause of admission from the start, and their persistence and poor response to treatment may be a manifestation that alerts to the presence of this disease.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common types of neurological disorder pre-vailing worldwide and is rapidly increasing in the elderly population across the globe. The cause of PD is still unknown, but a number of genetic as well as environmental factors contributing to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease have been identified. The hallmark of PD includes dopamine deficiency (neurotransmitter imbalance) due to the gradual loss of dopaminergic nerves in the sub-stantia nigra in the midbrain. Studying the mutation of associated genes is particularly informative in understanding the fundamental molecular and pathogenic changes in PD. Intracellular accumulation of misfolded or degraded protein due to mutated genes leading to the manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress followed by multifaceted patho-physiologic symptoms. Other studies include the appearance of both motor and non-motor responses like resting tremor, muscle stiffness, slow movement and anxiety, anaemia, constipation, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Many bioactive natural compounds have shown positive pharmacological results in treating a number of extensive disease models of PD. Despite the availability of end number of potent medicinal plants around the world, limited research has been done associated with various neurological disorders, in-cluding PD. The currently available dopamine-based drug treatments have several side-effects, fur-ther, not effective enough to combat PD completely. Therefore, various plant-based compounds with medicinal benefits have grabbed lots of attention of researchers to deal with various life-threatening neurodegenerative disorders like PD. On the basis of literature available till date, here, we have dis-cussed and addressed the molecular basis, current scenario, and the best possible treatment of PD for the future with minimal or no side-effects using various key bioactive compounds from natural origin/medicinal plants.",

      "abstract": "The data concerning neurophysiological and neurotransmitter mechanisms of two principal kinds of inhibition of behavior is carried out: the inborn genetically determined inhibition and that developed in the course of training. On the basis of the experiments performed by the author and the literature on general neurophysiology the conclusion is made that development of inhibition of behavior during training (i.e. internal inhibition, including \"latent inhibition\") is determined by the relative strengthening of inhibitory hyperpolarization processes either locally (in a conditioned stimulus analyzer) or globally in the brain cortex and other brain structures during intensification of the inhibitory state (profound inhibition of a reflex and sleep). The main neurotransmitter in development of internal inhibition is gamma-aminobutyric acid. Inhibition of behavior without preliminary training arises either during the action of superstrong stimuli, (exceeding the maximum value inhibition) or during interaction of two and more active systems. A stronger one of these two systems suppresses another one (external inhibition, dominant inhibition, \"freezing\", \"prepulse inhibition\", etc.). These kinds of inhibition develop on the background of EEG activation, which suggests participation in their realization of reticular structures and corresponding neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, noradrenalin, dopamine and serotonin). Behavior pathology causes a break of the balanced interaction between the excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system. This affects both genetically determined forms of behavior inhibition and the learned internal inhibition.",

The symptoms caused by MS are highly variable, and rehabilitation strategies, which often focus on movements and exercises to improve symptoms or function, are variable in success.The aim of this article is to summarise how motor and non-motor symptoms have an impact on walking ability in people with MS, and how this impact may vary across disability levels.A variety of motor and non-motor symptoms are common in people with MS early after diagnosis, but they vary in their impact on walking, and this differs by disability level. A comprehensive assessment of all symptoms is required to understand contributors to walking disability and thus direct targeted non-pharmacological management options.",

Further investigation revealed that the symptoms were caused by metachromatic leucodystrophy, Graves' disease, Huntington's disease, and a psychological background, respectively. The first patient became dependent in 1.5 years, the second recovered after treatment, the third was independent with slowly progressive symptoms after 1 year, and the fourth was advised to consult a psychologist. Disorders of attention and memory in relatively young people deserve a detailed evaluation at the very first visit, involving the elaboration of an initially extensive differential diagnosis. Too early a separation between a psychic and an organic pathogenesis should be avoided. Indications for the presence of a neurological condition include: consultation at the initiative of others, a relatively brief duration of symptoms without a clear provoking factor, the absence of a psychiatric history or life event, cognitive dysfunction in several areas, abnormal behaviour and an incriminating family history.",

The illness can affect more than a person's social difficulty; the disorder can cause individual several hardships. On another note, processing visual information is key in allowing organisms to navigate their environment, as it creates conscious awareness for social interaction and personal activities. In patients with schizophrenia, it has been established that impairments in visual processing exist and contribute to symptoms of the disorder. These visual impairments are misperceptions of real, external stimuli in their environment. Individuals with schizophrenia experience visual processing issues (i.e., issues with transduction), such as blurred vision and hypersensitivity. They can additionally experience hallucinations, which can be caused by irregular neurotransmitter flow. This can distort an existing stimulus or cause the perception of an entity that is not even there. The significance of these findings is to highlight possible dysfunction in neural networking regarding the visual processing of schizophrenic patients and to encourage future correlational studies on the topic.",

The most common definition is that of the Multiple Sclerosis council for clinical practice guidelines which defines fatigue as a “subjective lack of physical and/or mental energy that is perceived by the individual or caregiver to interfere with usual and desired activities”. Fatigue may be the first presenting symptom of MS and may be the only indicator of an acute relapse. Moreover, many patients report fatigue as their most burdensome symptom, and fatigue is a major contributor to unemployment and exerts a negative impact on quality of life. Specific and successful treatment options are virtually absent to date. The occurrence and severity of fatigue have been associated with depression, cognitive deficits, side effects of medications, immunological changes related to the autoimmune nature of MS, and radiological features on magnetic resonance imaging.

      "abstract": "A task force of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) recently published a tremor classification scheme that is based on the nosologic principle of two primary axes for classifying an illness: clinical manifestations (Axis 1) and etiology (Axis 2). An Axis 1 clinical syndrome is a recurring group of clinical symptoms, signs (physical findings) and possibly laboratory results that suggest the presence of at least one underlying Axis 2 etiology. Syndromes must be defined and used consistently to be of value in finding specific etiologies and effective treatments. The MDS task force concluded that essential tremor is a common neurological syndrome that has never been defined consistently by clinicians and researchers. The MDS task force defined essential tremor as a syndrome of bilateral upper limb action tremor of at least 3 years duration, with or without tremor in other locations (e.g., head, voice, or lower limbs), in the absence of other neurological signs (e.g., dystonia, parkinsonism, myoclonus, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and cognitive impairment). Deviations from this definition should not be labeled as essential tremor. Patients with additional questionably-abnormal signs or with signs of uncertain relevance to tremor are classified as essential tremor plus. The MDS classification scheme encourages a thorough unbiased phenotyping of patients with tremor, with no assumptions of etiology, pathology, pathophysiology or relationship to other neurological disorders. The etiologies, pathology and clinical course of essential tremor are too heterogeneous for this syndrome to be viewed as a disease or a family of diseases.",

      "abstract": "Dementia and depression are common disorders in old age. Dementia typically manifests itself as a neurodegenerative disease that affects cognitive functions such as memory, orientation and speech. Dementia is common in old age and its frequency increases from 1% in 65 year olds up to 50% beyond 90 years. Depression usually appears as an episodic disease which extends in length from a few weeks up to many years. The core symptoms of depression include depressed mood, loss of interests and pleasure and loss of will to live. Cognitive disorders may accompany depression and are considered separate from dementia, and were thus named pseudo-dementia, presuming that these cognitive disorders will disappear as the depressed mood will remit. Lately it has been documented that depression may precede dementia, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. Although correlation never proves causation we discuss three possibilities, not mutually exclusive: 1) Certain brain changes may manifest first as depression and later as dementia. 2) Depression and dementia have partially overlapping biological causes. 3) Certain biological changes associated with depression may lead to dementia. Dementia and depression show many common biologic features such as white matter changes in the brain, reduction of hippocampus volume, changes in the serotonergic and noradrenalinergic systems and abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) associates uncomfortable and painful sensations deep in the legs, with an urge to move the legs, that occur at rest, mainly in the evening and the night, and are at least partly alleviated by movements. RLS is a major cause of insomnia, daytime fatigue, and altered quality of life. It chronically affects 2% of the French population, is more frequent in women, peaks at middle age and has a remittent/ progressive evolution. Secondary causes include use of antidepressants, neuroleptics, low levels (< 50 ng/ml) of serum ferritin, polyneuritis and rhumatoid polyarthritis. The mechanisms of idiopathic RLS – probably genetic – may involve a deficit in brain iron storage, that leads to dopaminergic central dysfonction. RLS are exquisitely sensitive to low evening dose of dopamine agonists. Painful or resistant forms may benefit from association with anticonvulsivants, iron or opiates.",

      "abstract": "To try to understand the causative role of epilepsy per se in the developmental deterioration of brain injured infants, twenty-eight infants affected with early acquired, pre- and perinatal brain injuries were enrolled and divided into three groups, a) those with West syndrome, b) those with other non-West epilepsies, and c) those without epilepsy. Developmental monitoring consisted of a full clinical assessment, including examination of visual function, Griffiths developmental scales, standard EEG, long-term monitoring when necessary, and MRI, from the seizure onset or the first observation to the end of follow-up. Patients with epilepsy showed at study onset abnormal clinical features (neurological and developmental) distinct from those of non-epileptic patients, partially due to the varying severity of their brain injuries. A definite differentiation between groups was observed in the clinical evolution that showed among the epileptic patients, mostly in West syndrome, a significant deterioration. Moreover, impaired visual function at seizure onset was possibly associated with a bad developmental evolution. A developmental deterioration, mostly in West syndrome, accounts for a causative role of the epileptic disorder per se, but in few cases it was also observed in infants with only a brain injury, suggesting other aetiopathogenic mechanisms. The predictive value of early visual function seems to be confirmed.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Thirteen preterm children, aged 4 to 14 years, with visual impairment due to periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) were evaluated for visual function, intellectual level, cognitive profile and motor function. Their visual impairment was characterized by low acuity, crowding, visual field defects and ocular motility disturbances. Their cognitive profile was uneven, often with considerably higher scores on verbal than on visual‐spatial tasks. Nine children had normal intelligence, three had mild mental retardation and one had severe mental retardation. In all the children, visual impairment was complicated by visual perceptual difficulties, accounting for their greater visual handicap than would be expected from their visual acuities and strabismus alone. Though CT or MRI revealed bilateral PVL in all the children, six had no motor impairment consistent with cerebral palsy, which is an unexpected finding. RÉSUMÉ Troubles visuels chez le prématuré avec leacomalacie péri‐ventriculaire‐caractéristiques visuelles, cognitives el neuropédiatriques reliees àľimagerie cérébrale Une évaluation de la fonction visuelle, du niveau intellectuel, du profit cognitif et de la fonction motrice, a été effectuée chez treize prématurés âgés de 4 à 14 ans et présentant un trouble visuel liéà une leucomalacie périventriculaire (PVL). Le trouble visuel était caractérisé par une baisse de ľacuité, un décrochage du suivi, des défauts du champ visuel et des troubles de la motilité oculaire. Leur profil cognitif était dysharmonieux avec souvent des scores considérablement plus cleves aux taches verbales qu'aux taches visuo‐spatiales. Neuf enfants avaient une intelligence normale, trois un retard mental leger et un, un retard mental sévère. Chez tous les enfants, le trouble visuel était compliqué par des difficultés visuo‐perceptives, rendant compte ďun plus fort handicap visuel qu'on aurait pu attendre de leur acuité visuelle et du strabisme seuls. Bien que le scanner ct ľIRM. montraient une PVL bilatérale chez tous les enfants, six ne présentaient pas de déficit moteur de type IMC, ce qui est une découverte inattcndue.

Relation zu CT und MRT Befunden Bei 13 Frühgeborenen mit visuellen Störungen aufgrund einer periventrikulären Leukomalazie (PVL) wurden im Alter von 4 bis 14 Jahren Sehfunktion, Intelligenzgrad, Wahrnehmungsprofil und Motorfunktion untersucht. Ihre visuelle Stöning war charakterisiert durch gcringe Sehschärfe, Crowding, Gesichtsfeldeinschränkungen und Augenmotilitätsstörungen. Ihr Wahnehmungsprofil war unterschiedlich, häufig mit erhcblich höheren Scores bei den verbalen als bei den visucllräumlichen Aufgaben. Neun hatten eine normale Intelligenz, drei warcn leicht retardiert und eins hatte eine schwere geistige Behinderung. Bei allen Kindern war die visuelle Befund durch eine visuelle Perzeptionsstörung kompliziert. die für ihre größere visuelle Behinderung verantwortlich war, als dies von ihrer Sehschärfe und ihrem Strabismus zu erwarten wäre. Obwohl im CT oder MRT bei alien Kindern eine bilaterale PVL nachgewiesen worden war, hatten sechs Kinder keine motorischen Störungen im Sinne einer Cerebralparese, was überraschend ist. RESUMEN Alteración visual en niños pretérmino con leucomalacia periventricular. Características visuales, cognitivas y neuropediátricas en relación con la imagen cerebral Trecc niños pretérmino, de 4 a 14 años, con alteración visual debida a una leucomalacia periventricular (LPV), fueron evaluados en sus niveles dc función visual, nivel intelectual, perfil cognitivo y función motora. Su alteración visual se caracterizaba por una baja agudeza, una acumulación, defectos en el campo visual y alteraciones en la motilidad ocular. Su perfil cognitivo era desigual, a menudo con puntajes considerablemente altos en la tareas verbales, más que en las visuo‐espaciales. Nueve niños tenian una inteligencia normal, tres un retraso mental ligero y uno un retraso mental grave. En todos los niños la alteración visual estaba complicada con dificultades perceptivas visuales, lo que redundaba en una mayor dificultad visual de lo que cabria esperar de su sola agudeza visual y estrabismo. Aunque la TAC o la IRM revelaba una LPV en todos los niños, seis no tenian ninguna alteración motora del tipo de la paralisis cerebral, lo cual es un hallazgo inesperado.",

      "abstract": "Basic and Clinical Endocrinology Up-to-Date 136 Single benign sporadic insulinomas 2.1 Diagnosis of hypoglycaemia related to endogenous hyperinsulinism 2.1.1 Clinical symptoms of insulinomasThe clinical symptoms of insulinomas are heterogeneous and may differ among the patients.There is no specific clinical symptom.Hypoglycaemia results in autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms.Autonomic symptoms comprise adrenergic symptoms, such as palpitations and tremor, and cholinergic symptoms, with sweating, hunger, sometimes paresthesias.Neuroglycopenic symptoms comprise severe weakness, and many psychiatric and neurological manifestations, the most commonly reported being behavioural changes, confusion, agitation or slow reaction patterns, blurred vision, and finally seizures, transient loss of consciousness or hypoglycaemic coma.Hypoglycaemic coma is typically sudden, with agitation, sometimes pyramidal signs, and hypothermia; it may be profound and prolonged and therefore may be a cause of neurologic and cognitive sequelae and may occasionally lead to brain death.The combination of autonomic and moderate neuroglycopenic symptoms strongly suggests the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia.However, in insulinoma patients, autonomic symptoms may often be lacking.Neuroglycopenic symptoms are more specific of hypoglycemia related to insulinoma, but may be mild, or more often misleading.Therefore measurement of plasma glucose concentrations should be recommended in all patients with such symptoms, either in a patient without any known neurological or psychiatric disorder, or in a patient in whom such disorder had been previously controlled.Hypoglycaemic spells typically occur suddenly after a period of fast, several hours after the last meal, or after physical exercise.Some of them have been reported to occur within the hours following a meal or without any relationship with meal time, so that symptoms occurring in non fasting patients cannot rule out the diagnosis of insulinoma.In a series of 214 insulinoma patients with a reliable clinical history, symptoms of hypoglycaemia were reported exclusively in the fasting state in 73%, postprandial state in 6%, and both fasting and postprandial state in 21% (Placzkowski et al. 2009).Weight gain is found only in 25% of patients.Rapid (or rarely delayed) resolution of symptoms after glucose administration is part of Whipple's triad, which makes the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia when it has been assessed reliably; the triad comprises clinical symptoms of hypoglycaemia, the finding of a low plasma glucose concentration at the time of clinical symptoms, and subsiding of clinical symptoms after glucose administration.In rare pregnant patients with insulinoma, symptoms may resemble those of emesis in early pregnancy and may subside in late pregnancy as a consequence of insulin resistance, then are unmasked after delivery (Diaz et al. 2008), as reported in a patient who presented with coma and clonic seizures 14 hours after delivery (Christiansen & Vestergaard 2008). Biological diagnosis of insulinomas Plasma glucose concentrationsSince the clinical symptoms lack diagnostic specificity, measurement of plasma concentration of glucose is mandatory (ideally at the time of occurrence of clinical symptoms) and must be performed in venous blood samples with a reliable laboratory method.In order to avoid pseudohypoglycaemia, i.e. a consequence of glucose metabolism by blood cells in the tube containing the blood sample, the blood sample should be collected in a tube with a glycolysis inhibitor (NaF).Glucose concentrations are measured using reference method with hexokinase.",

      "title": "Neural correlates of executive functions in neurodegenerative diseases",
      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are a\n heterogeneous group of neurological conditions that share the common hallmark\n of progressive neuronal loss in circumscribed areas of the central nervous\n system. Both in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n (ALS), neurodegeneration mainly affects motor systems (i.e., the\n extra-pyramidal system in PD and the pyramidal system in ALS). In addition,\n both diseases are associated with a range of non-motor symptoms. Cognitive impairments,\n particularly in the domain of executive functions, are common in PD and in\n ALS. Executive functions are a set of higher-level mental control processes\n that control lower-level processes, which ensures that an individual can\n successfully pursue goals of action in daily life.\n Executive dysfunctions have implications\n for the disease prognosis and for the quality of life in patients and their\n caregivers. In order to optimally support patients and caregivers, the\n patient’s executive functions need to be adequately assessed and\n characterized. However, the disease-inherent motor symptoms can hamper\n neuropsychological testing and the interpretation of the results. The\n event-related potential (ERP) technique has been proposed as a tool to\n overcome these difficulties because ERPs can be non-invasively recorded from\n the scalp surface with minimal motor requirements for the examinee. In the\n present work, the ERP technique was used to assess neural correlates of\n executive functions in patients with PD and in patients with ALS. A\n particular focus was given to neural correlates of conflict processing,\n conflict adaptation, and performance monitoring—three aspects of executive\n functioning that facilitate successful behavior under demanding conditions.\n A comprehensive review (Study 1)\n summarized the existing literature of ERP correlates of cognitive functions\n and identified the circumstances under which ERP correlates of conflict\n processing, conflict adaptation, and performance monitoring are altered in\n PD. Amplitudes of the error(‑related) negativity (Ne/ERN),\n an ERP correlate of performance monitoring, were found to be consistently\n attenuated in PD. Ne/ERN amplitudes have been proposed to depend\n on dopamine levels. This presumed dopamine-dependence of the Ne/ERN\n has often been used to explain why Ne/ERN amplitudes are\n diminished in PD, although direct evidence for this hypothesis was lacking.\n In Study 2, the hypothesized dependence of Ne/ERN amplitudes\n on dopamine levels in PD was tested. To this end, the well-established\n flanker task was used to assess ERP correlates of performance monitoring in\n PD patients on and off dopaminergic medication. The results suggested that\n dopaminergic medication contributes to the attenuation of Ne/ERN\n amplitudes in PD, potentially by causing excessive dopamine levels in areas\n that are not primarily affected by PD, but are involved in the generation of\n the Ne/ERN.\n ERP correlates of conflict processing,\n conflict adaptation, and performance monitoring were also examined in ALS\n patients (Studies 3 and 4). ERP correlates of conflict processing and\n conflict adaptation did not differ between ALS patients and a sample of\n healthy control participants. However, ALS patients showed enhanced posterior\n ERP deflections, potentially indicative of a compensatory increase in the\n allocation of attentional resources to visual stimulus processing. Similar to\n PD, attenuated Ne/ERN amplitudes were found in ALS, but only in\n those ALS patients with comparably poor performance on standardized tests of\n executive functioning.\n Taken together, these data revealed\n different ERP signatures of executive functions in PD and ALS. These findings\n may enhance the understanding of executive dysfunctions and their neural\n underpinnings in these diseases. The here described work illustrates the\n potential usefulness of the ERP technique in the assessment of executive\n dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases affecting motor systems.",

      "abstract": "Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with visual hallucinations, REM-sleep behavior disorder, parkinsonism or fluctuations may have prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), but they often have overlapping Alzheimer's disease-related pathology as well. Identifying the imaging findings associated with prodromal DLB is necessary for understanding the disease progression and predicting who will progress to probable DLB in the near future. We investigated the distribution and magnitude of regional brain atrophy rates in prodromal DLB. Using AV-1451 PET, we assessed the association of tau-related pathology and atrophy rates. Patients with MCI (mean age=70) with one or more clinical features of DLB (n=56), who either progressed to probable DLB (n=28) or remained stable (n=28), and age- and sex-matched cognitively unimpaired adults (CU; n=112) who underwent at least two serial MRIs (average follow-up=18 months) were included. Regional gray matter atrophy rates were measured using Tensor-based morphometry with Symmetric Diffeomorphic Normalization. Regional and voxel-wise atrophy rates were compared among DLB-progressors, MCI-stable, and CU. In a subset of MCI patients (n=24), we estimated regional correlations between atrophy rates and AV-1451 uptake on PET at the time of MRIs. DLB-progressors showed greater atrophy rates in multiple subcortical and cortical regions compared to CU: caudate, thalamus, lateral temporal, parahippocampal/entorhinal, posterior cingulate, precuneus and orbital-frontal (p<0.001), and also lateral occipital, fusiform and middle frontal cortices (p<0.05), but the atrophy rates in the amygdala (p=0.072) and hippocampus (p=0.18) were low. DLB-progressors, compared to MCI-stables, showed also greater atrophy rates in caudate, thalamus, lateral temporal, posterior cingulate and orbito-frontal cortices (p<0.05). MCI-stables, compared to CU, showed slightly greater atrophy rates in lateral temporal, parahippocampus/entorhinal, fusiform and middle frontal cortices (p<0.05). Higher AV-1451 uptake correlated with a greater atrophy rate in the amygdala (r=0.62; p=0.001) but not elsewhere.",

      "abstract": "peech dysfunction is a major focal neurologic disability. The type of speech abnormality that a patient manifests allows the clinician to localize the lesion. We present a case of a patient who developed acute dysarthria without dysphasia. The CT brain revealed a hematoma in the pre-frontal cortex rather than the motor cortex or sub-cortical tracts. Considering the discrepancy between the clinical findings and the CT brain, an MRI of the brain was performed which, in fact, revealed an acute sub-cortical lesion, which explains the patients symptomatology. This study confirms again the importance of the physical examination in diagnosing neurological diseases rather than blindly depending on ancillary studies. An 80-year-old man, not known hypertensive or diabetic, non-smoker, with no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease, presented to the emergency unit with acute onset isolated dysarthria. No headache, fever, diplopia, motor weakness or altered level of consciousness. The patient understood and followed orders accurately. He answered questions correctly, but with a difficult to comprehend dysarthric speech. He had no apraxia of speech. He could read and write adequately. He had no weaknesses, normal gait, no disequilibrium, normal deep tendon reflexes and no Babinski signs, normal cranial nerves and fundi, no cerebellar signs, and was afebrile with no neck stiffness. A CT scan of the brain revealed an acute hemorrhage in the left superior frontal cortex. This lesion could not explain the isolated dysarthria. An MRI of the brain carried out on the same day revealed 2 acute lesions; a hemorrhagic lesion in the left superior frontal cortex and an ischemic lesion with restricted diffusion in the left pre-central primary motor cortex (",

      "abstract": "Dementia is usually attributable to one or a combination of neuropathologic abnormalities, including Alzheimer amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Most demented individuals have at least two types of dementia-related abnormality. Older decedents without abnormalities may be viewed as showing resistance to the relevant pathogenic processes. Others with brain or cognitive reserves may maintain normal cognitive performance even when 1 or 2 types of histopathologic abnormality have developed. We hypothesize essential resilience as a third defense against established neuropathology. Analyses involved 572 autopsied HAAS participants (Japanese-American men) dying at age 80 or older whose baseline Cognitive Assessment and Screening Instrument (CASI) score had been normal (>=74). End-of-life severe impairment was based on a final CASI score <60. Four overlapping reserve elements were each dichotomized as 0 or 1: (i) negligible brain atrophy, (ii) higher education, (iii) higher occupational complexity, (iv) higher adult life cognitive test scores. A neuropathologic burden index (Neurology, March 2016) was the sum of four histopathologic abnormalities, each scored 0.4 (moderate) or 1.0 (severe) for Alzheimer lesions, microinfarcts, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis. Among 159 participants with a neuropathologic burden index of zero, 145 (91%) maintained normal cognition. Among 387 with burden indices 0.4 - 1.8 (most with two moderate or severe lesion types), the proportions developing severe impairment fell from 49%, to 35%, to 29%, to 25%, to 13% respectively in decedents with zero, 1, 2, 3, or all 4 reserve elements. Of 26 decedents with neuropathologic burden indices >=2, 22 (85%) developed severe cognitive impairment. We continue to search for factors determining essential resilience. In this autopsied cohort, brain and/or cognitive reserves provided a powerful attenuation of cognitive impairment attributable to a panel of neuropathological abnormalities. A hypothesized additional contribution by essential resilience remains to be demonstrated.",

      "abstract": "• Acquired stuttering in the adult is rare and is usually associated with trauma or vascular disease. A recent patient had adult-onset dysfluency, and, subsequently, signs of progressive supranuclear palsy developed. A review of cases of extrapyramidal disease identified five parkinsonian patients with stutteringlike behavior. Dysfluencies were of slow onset and were an early symptom. Speech was characterized by repetitions/prolongations on initial syllables, which occurred on both small grammatical and substantive words. Dysfluency was found mostly in self-formulated speech. There was a positive adaptation effect. No secondary motor symptoms occurred and behavioral response to dysfluency was minimal. Speech characteristics of dysfluency associated with extrapyramidal disease differ from both developmental dysfluency and acquired dysfluency secondary to vascular or traumatic insults. In patients with adult-onset stutteringlike dysfluencies it is important to consider extrapyramidal disease.",

The criteria for setting a diagnosis refer to the presence of the following: performance of coordinated motor skills below that expected for chronological age, a deficit of motor skills that significantly and persistently interferes with activities of daily living, the onset of symptoms in an early developmental period, and a lack of motor skills that cannot be explained by intellectual disability or other neurological conditions that affect movement. This clinical picture is often comorbid with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and some other neurodevelopmental disorders. Prevailing DCD management includes task-oriented interventions as well as interventions focused on reducing impairment and improving physical function. The aim of the paper is to summarize typical DCD features related to diagnostic criteria, epidemiology, etiology, and comorbidities, as well as to present current management options.",

      "title": "Visual symptoms in Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "'Why do people see things that do not exist' The various visual disorders seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) are impaired visual acuity, impaired contrast sensitivity, colour discrimination, pupil reactivity, eye movement, motion perception, and visual processing speeds. In addition, disturbance of visuo-spatial orientation, facial recognition problems, and chronic visual hallucinations may be present. The common symptoms revealed by PD patients are difficulty in reading and double vision, illusions, feelings of presence and passage, and complex visual hallucinations (CVH). We, however, tend to group presence, passage, and illusions as 'hallucinations' in PD patients. Their pathophysiology appears to be different, as similar experiences are reported in the general populations as well, particularly in the 'sleep-wake' transition phase or in brainstem disorders and narcolepsy. Visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity (CS), color perception, and motion perception are all impaired in PD, with VA and CS identified as risk factors for CVH. The prodromal features of PD may include autonomic system involvement affecting pupil reactivity, abnormal colour vision, abnormal stereopsis with postural instability, defects in smooth pursuit eye movements, and insufficiencies in visuo-motor adaptation. PD dementia is associated with worsening of many ocular and visual problems involving eye movements, visuo-spatial function, and visual hallucinations. Visual misperception and hallucinations are seen in more than 50% of PD patients in advanced stages of the disease. The common symptoms reported by PD patients are vivid dreams, visual misperceptions and hallucinations, which may or may not lead to frank psychosis and dementia. Visual misperceptions are the images misinterpreted in presence of the stimulus, e.g., any specks on the wall are seen as ants or insects. Visual hallucinations are the visual images or perceptions in the absence of the stimuli. The occurrence of visual misperceptions and visual hallucinations is probably due to inability of the neural circuits to integrate information. Alteration in the attention and sleep-wake cycle may be the cause of these visual phenomenon. There have been postulations that these may be rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dream intrusions in the awake state. However, the polysomnography recordings failed to demonstrate such intrusions in PD patients. PD patients with a poor vision report more visual misperceptions than with normal vision. The possibility of loss of dopamine in the retinal cells with combination of dopaminergic overstimulation of these sensitized cells may contribute to the poor visual discrimination and subsequent visual misperception and visual hallucinations. Patients with eye disease report recurrent CVH, with an incidence from less than 1% to above 10%, depending on the selection and exclusion criteria.[1] Patients with diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) with particularly high rates of CVH have visual hallucinations as one of the possible diagnostic criteria. The acquired eye disease, occipital stroke, and sensory deprivation, with reduced visual input, however, have low rates of CVH ranging from 3– 18%. Patients with disturbed consciousness, as seen in narcolepsy and delirium, and patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, PD with dementia, and vascular dementia, and schizophrenia have high rates of CVH, ranging from 30–59%. In contrast, simple hallucinations are relatively frequent in sensory deprivation and eye disease, but rare in dementia, delirium, and PD. This double dissociation between simple and complex hallucinations suggests two things to us. First, that each type of hallucination has a single primary cause, and second, that these causes are separable within this complex system of perception of vision. Although CVHs are linked to cognitive decline in PD, the association between cognition and other visual phenomena, such as illusions, presence, and passage, has not been specifically addressed. In the study by Archibald et al., on PD patients, diplopia was seen in 38% of the total patients with PD and PD dementia. The PD duration, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, abnormal ocular alignment, and hypometric saccades were independent factors predictive of diplopia. The CVH group consisted of 38% of the total PD/PD dementia group. Three independent factors that were predictive of CVH were the diagnosis of dementia, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-2) score, and 'best at presentation' visual acuity (BAPVA). The diagnosis of dementia was the strongest individual predictor. Illusions were seen in 37%, presence in 40%, and passage in 54% patients. Independent factors for illusion were the ESS and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III scores. The present state had the REM (rapid eye movement) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and ESS scores as independent predictors. None of these variables contributed to a model predictive of sensations of passage. Results from neuropathological, structural, and functional imaging studies indicate that the occipitotemporal, occipitoparietal, limbic, and frontoparietal dysfunctions are likely to be vital in the pathophysiology of CVH. In contrast, measures of daytime somnolence and the presence of RBD contributed to models predictive of illusions and presence, suggesting that these visual experiences may be influenced by brainstem regions involved in sleep regulation and arousal.[2] In the current study,[3] PD patients as compared to controls, had a higher total visual misperception [VM] score and misperceptions of bistable percepts (VMB) compared to healthy controls. However, misperceptions for monostable percepts (VMS) and missed images were similar in cases and controls. PD patients who were taking a longer time to complete the trail making test parts A and B (TMT A and B) had increased frequency of VMs. An inverse correlation was also observed between the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and VMs, and between the frontal assessment battery (FAB) scores and visual misperceptions. One unit decrease in the FAB and MMSE score increased VM score by 1.226 and 1.304, respectively. In the control group, TMT-A was a significant predictor for VMs. There was also a correlation of VMs with disease duration, treatment duration, UPDRS-III, and Hoehn and Yahr stage in PD patients. Levodopa equivalent dose (LEDD) and visual misperceptions did not show any significant correlation. The subgroup with \"impaired visual perception\" had a longer disease and treatment duration, higher mean UPDRS-III scores, and advanced modified Hoehn and Yahr stages compared to the patient subgroup with normal visual perception. No significant difference for LEDD was observed between the two subgroups. There was no significant difference in the MMSE scores of the two subsets of patients (P = 0.199). However, the two subsets differed significantly with respect to TMT-A, TMT-B, TMT-B − A, and FAB scores. There was a significant difference in the identification of bistable percepts (VMB) between the two subsets. The mean VMB scores were 7.73 (±1.16) and 5.25 (±1.04) for those with impaired visual perception (VMES >6.75) and normal visual perception (visual misperception error score [VMES] ≤6.75), respectively (P value <0.0005). VMS and missed images were not different for the two subsets of patients. The risk of rise in VMs increased significantly with an increased disease duration, treatment duration, and scores on UPDRS, H and Y scale, TMTAs, TMTBs, TMT-B − A, and FAB.[3] The questions that arise include the following: Are these visual symptoms characteristic of the prodromal phase of PD?; and, is PD dementia associated with specific visual changes? Oculomotor and visual dysfunction in PD can involve the visual acuity, dynamic contrast sensitivity, colour discrimination, pupil reactivity, eye movement, motion perception, and visual processing speeds. In addition, disturbance of visuo-spatial orientation, facial recognition problems, and chronic visual hallucinations may be present. Prodromal features of PD may include autonomic system dysfunction potentially affecting pupil reactivity, abnormal colour vision, abnormal stereopsis associated with postural instability, defects in smooth pursuit eye movements, and deficits in visuo-motor adaptation, especially when accompanied by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder. PD dementia is associated with the exacerbation of impaired eye movements, visuo-spatial function, and visual hallucinations.[4] PD patients can exhibit significant non-motor symptoms including apathy, depression, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, dementia, and autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sensory dysfunction. Sensory symptoms may include visual dysfunction, eye movement abnormalities, loss of smell, auditory problems, pain and 'restless legs' syndrome.[5] They have the inability to judge distances or the shape of an object. Visual deficits in PD may affect motor disability. They are also risk factors for developing hallucinations and can have a significant influence on the general quality of life. Colour vision dysfunction in PD may be disease specific. PD patients frequently exhibit higher error scores than controls after age adjustment using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test. Frequency of errors increase with the severity of motor symptoms. Defective colour vision may also be an early sign of dopamine dysfunction in PD. However, the pathophysiology of colour discrimination deficits in PD is likely to be complex. Colour discrimination deficits in PD worsen with cognitive decline. In addition, the green light improved gait and reduced freezing of gait better than red or no light. Abnormal saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements are seen in about 75% of PD patients. Saccadic eye movements may be hypometric 'under reaching of task', while smooth pursuit movements interrupted by small additional saccades reveal saccadic pursuits that are necessary before reaching the final eye position and the patients also exhibited an increase in errors while remembering the target sequence. Impairment of depth perception in PD is associated with impaired VA and colour perception (stereopsis) and is due to the involvement of extrastriate cortical areas, neural pathways involving the thalamus and the posterior parietal lobes, which are also areas affected in PD dementia. Perceptual abnormalities in PD may result from dopamine dysfunction in the retina or can be attributable to deficiencies in attention due to dysfunction of the striato-frontal system. Hence, mild PD is associated with little perceptual abnormality, moderate PD with attention deficits, and more severe PD with both types of abnormality. This suggests that retinal influence on perception occur later in the disease. In addition, the presence of visuo-perceptual impairment could be an indication of developing PD dementia. Visual hallucinations are seen in PD patients especially when treated with L-dopa, dopamine agonists and with PD dementia. In this study, hallucinations were seen in 40% patients, being visual in 22% and auditory in 10% of patients. Minor hallucinations were associated with higher depression scores. Hallucinations were associated with severe cognitive defects, daytime somnolence, a longer duration of disease, poor vision, and reduced activity in the primary visual cortex. Many of the oculo-visual features present in early and middle stage PD will become more severe if the patient develops PD dementia. Deficits in colour vision and changes in pupillary function are often seen in PD dementia. Prominent visual hallucinations are significantly more frequent in PD dementia than in PD alone. Severe eye movement problems are more likely to be present in PD dementia and become more extensive with declining cognitive function. Defects in visuospatial orientation are likely to be greater in PD dementia, especially when associated with greater cortical atrophy. Separating PD from dementia with Lewy bodies DLB was thought to be important because patients with visual hallucinations may be treated with antipsychotic drugs, which may exacerbate symptoms in DLB. In addition, DLB patients were thought to exhibit fewer tremors, more asymmetry of motor symptoms, more falls, and respond less well to dopamine treatment than those with PD.[6] DLB and PD patients, however, exhibit similarities on a variety of saccadic eye movement tasks. Deficits in orientation, 'trail-making', and reading the names of colours ('Stroop test') suggest DLB rather than PD. Visual perception tasks (visual discrimination, space-motion and object-form recognition), however, are usually equally impaired in DLB and PD, especially in patients with visual hallucinations. In conclusion, PD affects vision and eye movements in the form of impaired visual acuity, colour discrimination, pupillary reactivity, eye movements, movement perception, and visual processing speeds. Visuo-spatial orientation, facial recognition difficulties, and CVH may also be present. The possible prodromal features of PD include autonomic system dysfunction (which could affect pupil reactivity), abnormal colour vision and stereopsis associated with postural instability; and abnormal smooth pursuit eye movement function. PD dementia is associated with the escalation of many of the visual difficulties present in PD but those involving eye movements, visuo-spatial function and CVH appear most specific.",

      "abstract": "Detailed history taking is of paramount importance to establish a reliable diagnosis in patients with transient loss of consciousness. In this article the clinical symptoms and signs of the successive phases of a syncopal episode are reviewed. A failure of the systemic circulation to perfuse the brain sufficiently results in a stereotyped progression of neurological symptoms and signs culminating in loss of consciousness; when transient, this is syncope. Prior to loss of consciousness the affected individual tends to exhibit unclear thinking, followed by fixation of the eyes in the midline and a 'frozen' appearance. Narrowing of the field of vision with loss of colour vision ('greying' out) and finally a complete loss of vision (hence 'blacking' out) occurs. Hearing loss may occur following loss of vision. This process may take as little as approximately 7 s in cases of sudden complete circulatory arrest (e.g. abrupt asystole), but in other circumstances it may take longer depending on the rate and depth of cerebral hypoperfusion. Complete loss of consciousness occurs with the 'turning up' of the eyeballs. Profound cerebral hypoperfusion may be accompanied by myoclonic jerks.",

      "abstract": "Motor weakness in a patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) may be related to (1) pre-existing neuromuscular disorder that leads to ICU admission, (2) new-onset or previously undiagnosed neurological disorder, or (3) complications of non-neuromuscular critical illness. Neuromuscular syndromes related to ICU treatment consist of critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, and prolonged neuromuscular blockade, and are now recognized as a frequent cause of newly acquired weakness in ICU patients. Clinical features include quadriparesis, muscle wasting, and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. Evaluation of these patients is based on knowledge of clinical setting and predisposing factors, focused neurological examination, detailed electrophysiological investigation, serum creatine kinase level, other laboratory studies as needed, and histological examination of muscle biopsy. If a central nervous system (brain or spinal cord) lesion is suspected, neuroimaging studies are required. In addition to conventional nerve conduction and needle electromyography, phrenic nerve conduction, diaphragm electromyography, blink reflex, and (recently) the technique of direct muscle stimulation have been employed. Critical illness polyneuropathy is an axonal motor and sensory neuropathy that often follows sepsis and multiorgan failure. Risk factors for critical illness myopathy are corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking drugs, acute respiratory illness, and organ transplant. Three subtypes (acute necrotizing myopathy, thick myosin filament loss myopathy, and type II fiber atrophy) are recognized. Major differential diagnoses of critical illness related paralysis are incidental Guillain-Barré syndrome and unmasked myasthenia gravis. Rarely, atypical presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polymyositis or other myopathies, and precipitation of porphyria or rhabdomyolysis due to drugs used in the ICU have been described. Recently a poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis due to West Nile virus infection was reported. A subgroup of patients with myasthenia gravis with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibody is noted to present as respiratory crisis. Muscle biopsy in ICU paralysis syndromes may be helpful in arriving at a specific diagnosis or to classify the type of critical illness myopathy. Nerve biopsy is only rarely indicated.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose : Absence status epilepticus (AS) is a prolonged, generalized, and nonconvulsive seizure that may occur in various circumstances. We report a series of patients in whom recurrent, unprovoked, typical AS was the main clinical feature. Method : We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients referred to our epileptic centers, on the following criteria: (1) recurrent, unprovoked episodes of typical AS representing the unique or the predominant seizure type, (2) at least one episode of AS recorded by video‐EEG or by EEG only, and (3) clinical and EEG features fulfilling the criteria of idiopathic epilepsy. We excluded patients with situation‐related AS. Results : We found 11 such cases (5F, 6M). The onset of AS was after puberty or in early adulthood in most; no clear triggering factor could account for the recurrence of AS episodes; infrequent generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and, rarely, absences, could also occur. These patients had no family history of epilepsy, normal neurological evaluation, normal neuroimaging, interictal EEG showing generalized spike‐ and polyspike‐wave discharges on a normal background, no photoparoxysmal response, variable response of AS to intravenous benzodiazepines, and usually good seizure control with valproate. This peculiar condition was misdiagnosed in most because of the unusual clinical presentation and of some atypical interictal EEG findings, often leading to the use of inappropriate drugs. Conclusion : Although there is some overlap with previously described epilepsy syndromes, specific and shared features point to the existence of a distinct epilepsy entity that we propose to name “absence status epilepsy.” This syndrome expands the spectrum of idiopathic generalized epilepsies.",

Perhaps the most common etiology is cognitive impairment, generally attributable to Alzheimer's disease or multi-infarct dementia. Organic or toxic etiologies need to be ruled out, especially in persons with visual hallucinations. Drug toxicity, a structural brain lesion, or a subtle seizure disorder should be considered.

      "abstract": "Early-onset dementia (EOD, &lt;65 years at onset) is a relatively common and frequently misdiagnosed condition. One reason for misdiagnosis is that EOD has a more varied differential diagnosis than late-onset dementia (LOD). For example, Alzheimer's disease (AD), the preponderant LOD, makes up only about one-third of EODs; the rest are due to vascular dementias, frontotemporal lobar degenerations, traumatic head injury, alcohol-related dementia, and a great many other conditions. Another reason for misdiagnosis is that early-onset AD may have predominant cognitive deficits other than memory loss and a potential familial inheritance with spastic paraparesis, seizures, or myoclonus. A third reason is that EOD often presents with neuropsychiatric features out-of-proportion to any cognitive deficits. Despite these obstacles, it is important to accurately diagnose EODs, particularly because they differ in management and course. Clinicians can successfully diagnose most EODs with careful cognitive and family histories, mental status and neurological examinations, and neuroimaging.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological inflammatory disorder known to attack the heavily myelinated regions of the nervous system including the optic nerves, cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord. This review will discuss the clinical manifestations and investigations for MS and other similar neurological inflammatory disorders affecting vision, as well as the effects of MS treatments on vision. Assessment of visual pathways is critical, considering MS can involve multiple components of the visual pathway, including optic nerves, uvea, retina and occipital cortex. Optical coherence tomography is increasingly being recognised as a highly sensitive tool in detecting subclinical optic nerve changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical in MS diagnosis and in predicting long-term disability. Optic neuritis in MS involves unilateral vision loss, with characteristic pain on eye movement. The visual loss in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder tends to be more severe with preferential altitudinal field loss, chiasmal and tract lesions are also more common. Other differential diagnoses include chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy and giant cell arteritis. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy affects young males and visual loss tends to be painless and subacute, typically involving both optic nerves. MS lesions in the vestibulocerebellum, brainstem, thalamus and basal ganglia may lead to abnormalities of gaze, saccades, pursuit and nystagmus which can be identified on eye examination. Medial longitudinal fasciculus lesions can cause another frequent presentation of MS, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, with failure of ipsilateral eye adduction and contralateral eye abduction nystagmus. Treatments for MS include high-dose corticosteroids for acute relapses and disease-modifying medications for relapse prevention. These therapies may also have adverse effects on vision, including central serous retinopathy with corticosteroid therapy and macular oedema with fingolimod.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Neurological symptoms, such as facial asymmetry, speech abnormalities and weakness, are common presentation to the Emergency Department, with acute stroke being the most important differential that must be diagnosed in timely manner for appropriate management. Such symptoms are typical presentations of anterior circulation strokes. Posterior circulations strokes can be more complicated to diagnose, clinically and radiographically, as more vague symptoms such dizziness, vomiting or visual disturbance usually prevail. Less common atypical symptoms can be missed and failed to be identified as stroke. Anterior circulation strokes are more common, with MCA being the culprit in most cases. ACA occlusions with resultant ischemic stroke is less prevalent. When present, the main symptom is weakness in the lower limb with mildly deranged upper limb weakness. Case description: 42 years old Indian man, known case of uncontrolled type 2 DM and Hypertension, presented to the ER, with 14 hours of worsening right lower limb numbness with decrease sensation. Patient been having gradually symptoms for 2 days prior to the sudden decline in sensation. Patient denied any other neurological symptoms. He had history of acute ischemic stroke (Acute left lateral medullary infarct) 8 months prior to his presentation. Examination revealed decreased sensation in right lower limbs, with positive SLR. Patient has full motor power in all 4 limbs, no cranial nerves deficit and no cerebellar signs. CT angiography showed left ACA – A2 complete occlusion with a mismatch present in CT perfusion study. Patient underwent mechanical thrombectomy immediately. Patient had complete resolution of symptoms and was discharged 2 days later from hospital. Discussion: Code strokes are common in tertiary hospital and aim to expediate imaging and fasten the response of the multidisciplinary team managing strokes. BE-FAST is a quick tool used in pre-hospital setting and hospital settings for early stroke recognition. Such tools omit less common symptoms of stroke, that are usually caught when patients are high risk of stroke, despite the symptoms or clinical examination. Recurrent strokes should be suspected in any patient presenting with any new or worsening focal neurological deficit.",

      "abstract": "Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by persistent aberrant measles virus infection. It is characterized by behavioral changes, cognitive decline with deterioration in academic performance, visual dysfunction, focal or generalized seizures ,myoclonus, spasticity, mutism and akinesia ultimately leading to a vegetative state. Balint's syndrome, characterized by the triad of simultagnosia, optic ataxia, and oculomotor apraxia, as an initial presenting feature of SSPE is rare. Autonomic dysfunction in SSPE is attributed to central autonomic involvement, with decreased heart rate variability a predictor for arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. We report an unusual case of a 22-year-old male presenting with features suggestive of Balint's syndrome. Myoclonus and cognitive decline appeared 6 months after the first onset of symptoms, along with autonomic dysfunction. Thereafter, rapid progression of symptoms was noted. Cerebrospinal fluid and electroencephalography after the first symptom onset were consistent with a diagnosis of SSPE. The patient ultimately succumbed to his illness. Thus we highlight atypical presentation of SSPE with autonomic dysfunction. A high index of suspicion is needed for prompt and timely intervention.

The main clinical characteristics are the dysfunctions of sensory, motor and autonomic nerves in the area of the affected nerves. The sensory nerve abnormality includes paresthesia, burning sensation, and tactile sensitivity reduction. The motor nerve abnormality includes limited mobility, and weakened or disappeared deep tendinous reflect. The autonomic nervous′ symptoms include constipation, abdominal pain, frequent micturition, and sexual dysfunction. The mechanism of DIPN includes the drug′s direct injury on the peripheral nerves, the immune-mediated nerve injury and the inflammatory damage of the neurotrophic vessels. The pathological nerve fibers show that the changes of segmental demyelination, axonal degeneration, dense granule and vacuole. The results of neuroelectrophysiological examinations show that the decrease of the amplitude and conduction velocity of sensory nerve action potential, and the normal or light change of the amplitude and conduction velocity of motor nerve action potential. The diagnosis of DIPN are mainly on the basis of the history of drug exposure, clinical characteristics and the results of neuroelectrophysiological examination. The causality between the drugs and the peripheral neuropathy is evaluated by Naranjo. The treatment of DIPN includes drug withdrawal or decreasing of the dosages of suspected drugs, taking anticonvulsants, antidepressants or opioid drugs, local anesthetics, and lipophilic antioxidants-zinc sulfate at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey words: \r\nPeripheral nervous system diseases; Drug therapy; Diagnosis",

      "title": "Retrograde Amnesia – A Question of Disturbed Calcium Levels?",
      "abstract": "Retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events or information. The successful acquisition and memory of information is required before retrograde amnesia may occur. Often, the trigger for retrograde amnesia is a traumatic event. Loss of memories may be caused in two ways: either by loss/erasure of the memory itself or by the inability to access the memory, which is still present. In general, memories and learning are associated with a positive connotation although the extinction of unpleasant experiences and memories of traumatic events may be highly welcome. In contrast to the many experimental models addressing learning deficits caused by anterograde amnesia, the incapability to acquire new information, retrograde amnesia could so far only be investigated sporadically in human patients and in a limited number of model systems. Apart from models and diseases in which neurodegeneration or dementia like Alzheimer’s disease result in loss of memory, retrograde amnesia can be elicited by various drugs of which alcohol is the most prominent one and exemplifies the non-specific effects and the variable duration. External or internal impacts like traumatic brain injury, stroke, or electroconvulsive treatments may similarly result in variable degrees of retrograde amnesia. In this review, I will discuss a new genetic approach to induce retrograde amnesia in a mouse model and raise the hypothesis that retrograde amnesia is caused by altered intracellular calcium homeostasis. Recently, we observed that neuronal loss of neuroplastin resulted in retrograde amnesia specifically for associative memories. Neuroplastin is tightly linked to the expression of the main Ca 2+ extruding pumps, the plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs). Therefore, neuronal loss of neuroplastin may block the retrieval and storage of associative memories by interference with Ca 2+ signaling cascades. The possibility to elicit retrograde amnesia in a controlled manner allows to investigate the underlying mechanisms and may provide a deeper understanding of the molecular and circuit processes of memory.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents, which tends to be a particularly malignant and intractable condition, somatic condition, increases the likelihood of recurrence and is a major cause of suicide attempt and death, and chronicity in adulthood. Increases in alpha- or theta- band activity, or asymmetries in the alpha band may predict successful responses to treatment with selective serotonin uptake inhibitors. Reward-related brain function, such as greater reactivity in the lower medial prefrontal cortex, and greater right-side frontal brain activity predict MDD symptoms. Greater activation of both the amygdale, related to functional connections, has been reported as the neurobiological bases of adolescent MDD. An increased imbalance of resting-state brain activity between the frontal cognitive control system and the limbic-striatal emotional processing system was recognized. Inherited risks, such as developmental factors and psychosocial adversity, interact to increase the risk of depression through hormonal factors and the associated perturbation of the relevant neural pathway. These multiple complex pathophysiological factors might contribute to the development of a particularly malignant and intractable adolescent depression, and cause increased likelihood of recurrence and chronicity in adulthood. Daily doses of escitalopram and fluoxethine (10-20 mg) have been demonstrated as effective in treating adolescents with MDD. However, a recent review article has proposed that escitalopram should be considered as a second-line treatment option for adolescents with MDD. It should be noted that escitalopram treatment has been recommended on the basis of a single study of positive behavioral cognitive therapy because of lack of evidence.",

Identical symptoms can occur, however, with discrete infarctions or hemorrhages involving the central vestibulocerebellum. Whereas acute labyrinthine disorders are usually benign and self-limited, vascular injuries of the cerebellum may produce swelling, compression of the brain stem and acute hydrocephalus one to four days after the onset of symptoms. Therefore it is important to accurately distinguish between labyrinthine and vestibulocerebellar disorders with the neurologic examination. Acute labyrinthine disease causes unidirectional nystagmus with past-pointing and falling in the opposite direction of the nystagmus, environmental vertigo in the same direction and suppression of the nystagmus with visual fixation. Disorders of the vestibulocerebellum do not produce this consistent pattern of findings.",

      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited. Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.",

The goal of this study is to learn whether participants with PD have defective visuospatial disembedding and whether this defect responds to dopaminergic treatment. We also wanted to examine the relationship of disembedding with other cognitive processes and the different parkinsonian clinical symptoms. Participants were PD patients and matched controls. PD participants were tested \"on\" and \"off\" medications on the Hidden Patterns Test (HPT) and tests of frontal-executive functions. PD patients had difficulties in visual-spatial disembedding that were not related to medication status, illness duration or severity, or symptom presentation, but were related to other tasks requiring visual scanning in response to alterations in spatial allocation of attention. Lack of improvement with dopaminergic treatment suggests deficits in other neurotransmitter-neuromodulatory systems or degenerative processes in the frontal-striatal networks, cortex, or basal ganglia.",

Notably, cognitive subdomains such as learning and memory, executive functioning, processing speed, and attention and concentration are significantly impaired during, and between, episodes in individuals with MDD. Most antidepressants have not been developed and/or evaluated for their ability to directly and independently ameliorate cognitive deficits. Multiple interacting neurobiological mechanisms (eg, neuroinflammation) are implicated as subserving cognitive deficits in MDD. A testable hypothesis, with preliminary support, posits that improving performance across cognitive domains in individuals with MDD may improve psychosocial function, workplace function, quality of life, and other patient-reported outcomes, independent of effects on core mood symptoms. Herein we aim to (1) provide a rationale for prioritizing cognitive deficits as a therapeutic target, (2) briefly discuss the neurobiological substrates subserving cognitive dysfunction, and (3) provide an update on current and future treatment avenues.",

      "abstract": "Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe, chronic, epileptic encephalopathy, primarily with childhood onset, which is characterised by a triad of features: multiple seizure types, including tonic seizures that may appear late in the course of the disorder; abnormal EEG features with slow spike-wave discharges; and cognitive impairment. Recognition of LGS is problematic, since the seizure types and EEG features that characterise it are not pathognomonic and often change over time. Furthermore, although seizures associated with LGS may occur de novo, the appearance of core LGS seizures may be preceded by prolonged periods of other seizure types, including myoclonic seizures, partial seizures, or infantile spasms. This has led some authors to postulate that a continuum between LGS and other types of childhood epilepsy may exist. Accurate diagnosis requires careful assessment of both clinical and EEG features, in order to distinguish LGS from other childhood epilepsy syndromes, such as atypical benign partial epilepsy of childhood, Dravet syndrome or epilepsies with predominantly myoclonic-astatic seizures. Since there is no biological marker that can be used to confirm diagnosis of LGS and because of the multiple aetiologies that could lead to its development, early referral to a specialist team may prove to be crucial for facilitating both diagnosis and management. Such an approach ensures that patients receive the appropriate treatment at the correct time, providing the best opportunity for the clinical course and overall prognosis to be improved. Effective management of LGS requires regular reappraisal of the evolving symptoms and features, and adjustment of the treatment accordingly.",

      "abstract": "An understanding of the neurocognitive and neurobiological underpinnings of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is important in differentiating BDD from related disorders, namely obsessive–compulsive disorder and psychotic disorders. Similar cognitive anomalies in executive function, spatial visual processing and memory (bias to process detailed visual information) have been found in BDD and obsessive–compulsive disorder samples, while schizophrenia patients display more pervasive cognitive deficits. Emotional hyperactivity and misinterpretation of emotion in others have been found in BDD, with similar results to obsessive–compulsive disorder samples. Neuroimaging has shown abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex, visual cortex, caudate nucleus and right amygdala in BDD patients. These findings are consistent with the neurocognitive profile. This field of research is in its infancy. However, the bias towards detailed visual analysis may be an important clue when investigating the neurobiological basis of BDD, and could explain why individuals exhibit focused attention on one aspect of their own appearance. Emotional hyperarousal caused by amygdala pathology may reinforce a perception of negative physical appearance.",

OAB symptoms are reviewed with special relevance to its etiopathlogy.Numerous validated assessment tools are available for OAB symptoms. They are variable in question items and response scale, but most of them are highly responsive to quality of life impairment and treatment outcomes. It should be kept in mind whether the tool addresses symptoms including OAB symptoms, OAB symptoms alone, or symptom bother. The cardinal symptom of OAB is urgency, a strong desire to void of sudden onset. Suddenness of urgency is associated with symptom severity and its all-or-none nature is indicative of a disorder in bladder afferent signal processing.Etiopathology of OAB or urgency is highly heterogeneous and may be found in detrusor muscle, bladder nervous system, and the brain. OAB is reflective of a condition of sensory dysfunction of the bladder, wherein the patients feel a strong desire to void at a smaller bladder volume (sensory hyperactivity) and notice desire to void too late (impaired perception). This ambivalent condition could be named as 'sensory hyperactivity with impaired perception'.",

      "abstract": "Increasing recognition that Parkinson's disease (PD) may start outside of the substantia nigra has led to a rapidly expanding effort to define prodromal stages of PD, before motor signs permit classical diagnosis. Many of these efforts center around the identification of clinical non-motor symptoms and signs of disease. There is now direct evidence that olfaction, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), constipation, and depression can be present in prodromal PD. In addition, there is suggestive evidence that visual changes, other autonomic symptoms, and subtle cognitive changes may also be present at prodromal stages. A critical issue in utility of these prodromal markers will be assessment of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Although these have yet to be fully defined, olfactory deficits, some visual changes, and autonomic symptoms occur in the majority of PD patients at diagnosis, suggesting good potential sensitivity. However, with the exception of RBD and perhaps some specific autonomic measures, specificity, and positive predictive value of these markers may be insufficient to be used alone as identifiers of prodromal disease. The evidence for the utility of olfaction, RBD, autonomic markers, visual changes, mood disorders, and cognitive loss as markers of prodromal PD and the potential sensitivity and specificity of these markers are summarized.",

We conducted a literature review using PUBMED and GOOGLE SCHOLAR to evaluate the occurrence of different neurological disorders in people with SCI. Individuals with SCI seem at an increased risk of stroke, cognitive impairment, dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome, and seizures. The co-occurrence of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and myasthenia gravis, were also reported. Neurological comorbidities in individuals with SCI may lead to poor long-term outcomes, which could be minimized by early diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.",

Presentamos el caso de un varón de 90 años con antecedentes de degeneración macular asociada a la edad avanzada y ceguera legal, que consultó por la aparición de alucinaciones visuales nítidas, complejas y estructuradas, reconocidas por él como irreales. Las alucinaciones incluían figuras humanas, animales y escenas en movimiento, sin componente auditivo ni afectación emocional asociada. El examen psiquiátrico reveló un estado cognitivo conservado (MMSE 28/30) y sin signos de psicosis o demencia. La evaluación geriátrica integral mostró una buena funcionalidad general, y la neuroimagen descartó lesiones estructurales cerebrales. Ante la ausencia de patología neurológica o psiquiátrica concomitante, se estableció la impresión diagnóstica de SCB. El manejo incluyó psicoeducación al paciente y a su familia, optimización del entorno visual y una pauta baja de quetiapina (12,5 mg/noche) con buena tolerancia y respuesta favorable. El caso subraya la importancia del reconocimiento del SCB en el contexto de la pérdida visual severa en personas mayores. El desconocimiento del síndrome puede llevar a diagnósticos erróneos de demencia o psicosis, con consecuencias innecesarias. Un abordaje multidisciplinar centrado en la educación, el soporte visual y, en casos seleccionados, el tratamiento farmacológico sintomático, puede mejorar significativamente la calidad de vida del paciente.",

Firstly, it may be distinguished from other causes of peripheral motor involvement such as muscle diseases and disorders of the neuromuscular junction. Secondly, it may be discussed in two different forms: acute and chronic. Acute chronic neuropathies are mainly observed in Guillain‐Barré syndrome, in which electrophysiological studies allow us to recognize the classical demyelinating form and the axonal form. The other causes of acute motor neuropathy are mainly poliomyelitis and porphyrias. Chronic motor neuropathies are mainly observed in motor neuron diseases, mainly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but also Kennedy’s disease and other lower motor neuron diseases which may be inherited or acquired. The other causes are multifocal motor neuropathy and the predominantly motor forms of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The characterization of these different types of chronic neuropathy is of major importance because of the therapeutic consequences which may lead to the proposal of specific treatments.",

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

      "title": "New symptoms in a patient with diagnosed porphyria – untypical clinical course or another disease? Extended differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Acute liver porphyrias are caused by mutations of genes encoding the heme biosynthesis enzymes. A lack of any of these enzymes leads to a decrease in the heme level, which in each case is manifested by identical clinical symptoms. Nervous tissue is particularly susceptible to a depletion of heme levels. Three classical symptoms of a porphyria attack include: abdominal pain (as a manifestation of autonomic neuropathy), peripheral neuropathy, and psychic disturbances. Apart from the main symptoms, porphyria attacks may be manifested as various neurological disturbances, such as: bulbar palsy, epileptic seizures, psychic disturbances and focal symptoms of CNS damage. The intensity of individual symptoms can vary. Although neurological symptoms usually disappear after the attack, they may cause permanent deficits. Through involving CNS, porphyria can mimic other neurological disorders. Damage to the nervous system can be confirmed by additional examinations. Thus far, disseminated focal changes during the attack, which disappear after the regression of clinical symptoms, have been described in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Spinal cord abnormalities in MRI scans have not been described yet, despite the fact that damage to the anterior horn associated with porphyria has been confirmed in literature. While examining cerebrospinal fluid during the attack, an elevated protein level has been noticed, so far without the presence of oligoclonal bands. This paper aimed to demonstrate that porphyria should be considered in differential diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). This paper is based on the case of a symptomatic patient who carried a mutation in one of the genes for porphyria, and who developed a clinical manifestation of focal damage to CNS. A differential diagnosis of porphyria and CIS, with a subsequent conversion to a clinically defined MS, was carried out. The results of additional examinations performed routinely in both disorders, the clinical picture and data from medical literature have been used in the analysis of this case. The authors present the case of a patient with confirmed genetic porphyria, who was hospitalized for purposes of establishing a diagnosis due to weakened lower extremities. The patient manifested spastic lower extremity paresis, sensation disorders and urinary incontinence, which indicated spinal cord damages. An MRI scan of the thoracic spine revealed disseminated foci with contrast enhancement. A high level of proteins and oligoclonal bands were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. On the basis of a new clinical picture (differing from the previous attack symptoms), prolonged symptoms, spinal cord lesions in MRI, and the presence of oligoclonal bands, CIS was diagnosed. Quick and complete recovery was obtained due to the administering of a steroid therapy. After several months, the patient reported a similar, passing episode, which, according to the authors, confirmed the diagnosis and an expected conversion to a clinically defined MS. Taking into consideration the clinical manifestation of spinal cord involvement untypical of porphyria, the detection of spinal lesions in an MRI scan, the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid and the positive effect of steroid therapy, the authors believe that this described patient, who was a symptomatic carrier of a mutation in a gene for porphyria, developed CIS. This reported case, supported by data from medical literature, shows that porphyria should be taken into consideration in any differential diagnosis of CIS and MS.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Conversion disorder (a term that describes what was previously called hysteria) refers to motor or sensory symptoms, or both, that resemble a neurological disease, but that do not originate from or cannot be explained by a known physical disease. Objectives To find reliable tools that can guide the difficult diagnosis of conversion disorder. Methods Bibliographic review Results The exact prevalence of the disorder is unknown. It is estimated that approximately 5% of referrals to neurology are for this disorder. Approximately one third of patients referred to the neurologist have symptoms that cannot be explained by an organic disease. Involuntary movements are the most common motor manifestations of the conversive syndrome, being tremor one of the most frequent manifestations. The first differential diagnosis of conversion disorder is neurological disease. It is currently not necessary for the diagnosis to assess whether or not the symptoms are produced intentionally, as the assessment of conscious intentionality is unreliable. The neurological examination is the fundamental tool for the diagnostic approach, being even more enlightening than the complementary tests. Hoover’s sign, Babinski’s combined leg flexion, plantar flexion of the ankle, tremor and its distraction and synchronisation manoeuvres, as well as the clinical differences between epileptic seizures and non-epileptic seizures of psychogenic origin, are some of the reliable tools for a correct diagnosis. Conclusions The diagnosis of the disease should be one of exclusion. There must be clinical data showing clear evidence of incompatibility with a neurological disease and conversion symptoms do not correspond to known physiological mechanisms and anatomical pathways.

      "abstract": "Addiction is a specific psychosocial result of a complex neurobiological process in the existence of individuals. As pharmacologically term addiction arises from creation of physiological adaptation to the substance and with occurrence of withdrawal syndrome in the moment of cessation of both substance intake and effect of the substance. With psychobiological disorders created as a result of such adaptations, addiction becomes the illness of central nervous system. Persistent and compulsive usage is created through forming of long term associative memory in several neural networks including prefrontal cortex. 'Pathological usurpation of neural of learning and memory mechanisms, which normally serve to shape behavior connected to the reward as well as a signal for prediction of reward' Defining one phenomenon with addiction term requires application of medical model. Therefore illness is defined before all with existence of stable pathological signs and symptoms, which are expressed through dysfunction of some organs and followed by individual experience of torment and misery of individuals. Symptoms have to have stable and regular occurrence with large number of patients and make one clinical picture. This allows diagnostics, classification and requires treatment. Outcome of the addiction and future career /destiny of the addict largely is connected with his/her primary bio-psychological potentials and possible other diagnosis besides addiction. Therefore, therapeutic possibilities in treatment of addictions are determined by the use of pharmaco-therapeutic means, but in many cases they are determined by society’s attitude towards psychoactive substance and addicts. Namely, the goals of treatment depend on it, as well as different modalities of rehabilitation and social reintegration of addicts. This paper analyzes forms of treatment and rehabilitation of addicts, it also estimates theoretical forecast of treatment possibilities with realistically realized therapeutic programs.",

      "title": "The depressed brain in Parkinson's disease: Implications for an inflammatory biomarker",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder currently diagnosed solely on the presence of motor symptoms (i.e., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability) and their response to dopamine replacement therapy. A major unmet need is the limited number and failure of clinical trials with putative neuroprotective agents intended to halt or delay disease progression. Three main reasons account for this development: ( i ) At the time of the clinical diagnosis >50% of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have degenerated (1) and other neurotransmitter systems (e.g., norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine) have been affected, indicating that the disease is already at an advanced stage (2); ( ii ) some reports suggest low accuracy for a PD clinical diagnosis, with up to 50% misdiagnosis in early disease (i.e., within 5 y of diagnosis) (3); and ( iii ) there is still no objective meaningful endpoint for clinical trials for early PD other than the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), a rater-based assessment of symptom severity. Thus, there is a need for objective biomarkers that either are neuropathophysiological manifestations of the disease (marker of state), track the speed of its progression (marker of rate), or are present in at-risk PD (marker of trait) (4). Adding complexity to this endeavor is the fact that PD is very heterogeneous in its clinical, neuropathological, and probably also pathophysiological presentation, with various subtyping strategies based on motor and also nonmotor symptoms recently proposed (5). Given the disease’s complexity and variability, … \n\n[↵][1]1To whom correspondence should be addressed. Email: brit.mollenhauer{at}med.uni-goettingen.de.\n\n [1]: #xref-corresp-1-1",

      "abstract": "Response inhibition of hand and eye-movement is to suppress the inappropriate response in hand and eye. Comparing with the classical paradigms such as Go/Nogo or Stop-signal, response inhibition of eye movement can provide more indices, and can separate from the confusion of verbal or hand movement. Response inhibition of hand and eye-movement differ in some neurological and psychiatric disorders, and the different developmental stages. Fronto-basal ganglia circuit play a similar role in eye and hand inhibition, but IFG is only key for hand response inhibition, and FEF and SC are only key for eye response inhibition. The arguments focused on the neural mechanisms, related higher cognitive activity, and the different performance and tendency in neuropsychology and developmental psychology.",

      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a permanent, nonprogressive disorder of movement and posture due to a lesion of the fetal or infant brain. The goal was to determine whether children with different severities of CP, as defined using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), had different degrees or types of visual dysfunction.An observational, cross-sectional-design study was conducted by using neurologic and masked ophthalmic measurements on a representative cohort of 50 children with CP. Mean age was 5.6 years (range, 2-19.5 years); mean gestational age was 31 weeks.The likelihood of debilitating visual deficits was greater in children with higher GMFCS scores, independent of gestational age. Children with level 5 disease (most severe) were at greatest risk for high myopia, absence of binocular fusion, dyskinetic strabismus, severe gaze dysfunction, and optic neuropathy or cerebral visual impairment (CVI). These deficits were rare or absent in children with the mildest disease, level 1. When categorized by anatomic or physiologic CP subtype, diplegic and spastic children were more often hyperopic and esotropic, but had the highest prevalence of fusion and stereopsis. In contrast, children with quadriplegic and mixed CP (dyskinetic, athetoid, hypotonic, and ataxic) more often had high myopia, CVI, dyskinetic strabismus, and gaze dysfunction.Visual deficits differ in children who have mild versus severe CP. Children with GMFCS level 1 to 2 have sensorimotor deficits resembling those of neurologically normal children with strabismus and amblyopia; children at level 3 to 5 have more severe deficits, not observed in neurologically normal children.",

      "title": "Paradoxical Cognitive Capacities in Dual Diagnosis Schizophrenia: The Quest for Explanatory Factors",
      "abstract": "Objective: Individuals with either schizophrenia or a substance use disorder have been shown to independently display cognitive deficits. Patients with schizophrenia who abuse psychoactive substances should then arguably display an aggravation in cognitive impairment. However, cognitive integrity among individuals with dual diagnosis remains paradoxical, with some studies reporting dysfunction and others reporting preservation. Methods: A literature search of PubMed and PsycInfo was conducted using the following major inclusion criteria: (a) schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, (b) presence or absence of a substance use disorder, and (c) measures of cognitive function. Results: Young patients with schizophrenia and comorbid substance abuse typically display better cognitive abilities than older individuals with dual diagnosis. Also, depending on the type of task assessed, cognition either remains relatively intact (e.g., psychomotor speed), dysfunctional (e.g., verbal memory), or ambiguous (e.g., impulsivity). Performance on tasks of impulsivity, however, remains particularly difficult to interpret, most probably due to the complexity of the multidimensional construct of this cognitive domain. Finally, depending on the preference of psychoactive substance used, some individuals with dual diagnosis exhibit better cognitive function (e.g., cannabis), while others display marked decreases on task performance (e.g., alcohol), relative to those with schizophrenia only. Conclusions: Age, type of cognitive function measured, and type of psychoactive substance abused appear to be three factors that interact to contribute to the array of current findings among patients with dual diagnoses of schizophrenia and substance use disorder.",

      "title": "Cognitive skills and prominence production : highlighting prominent elements in the speech of patients with Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Patients with idiopathic parkinsonism suffer from a neurodegenerative disorder of the nervous system. Due to a progressive loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) develop problems with motor and non-motor functions. On the motor level the dysfunctions defect the voluntary movements and lead to symptoms like: rigidity, resting tremor and bradykinesia [1]. On the level of cognition PD patients have problems with the executive functions, cognitive flexibility, working memory and control of attention [2]. Furthermore, the speech system gets affected which often leads to dysarthric speech. This hypokinetic dysarthria impacts the phonation, articulation and the respiratory system. The speech deficits include monoloudness, monopitch, reduced stress, imprecise articulation, variability of speech rate, disfluencies and voice tremor [3, 4, 5].PD affects communication as well as other related functions such as cognition, but complex prosodic aspects such as focus marking are less well studied. Prominence marking in German requires changes in intonation and articulation [6]. Speakers use multiple cues in the phonetic domain to regulate prosodic marking [7], e.g. modulation of F0 and syllable duration. Furthermore, there is insufficient literature on the impact of cognition on these phonetic aspects of prominence marking. The aim of this study is to analyse how prosodic prominence correlates with motoric and cognitive abilities in patients with Parkinson’s disease in the complex process of speech production.",

The child and adolescent presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms always needs a neuropsychiatric work-up comprising a psychiatric examination and a neurodevelopmental evaluation. Laboratory work-up of some kind is often required also as is a neuropsychological assessment. It is always difficult to draw the clinical line in deciding what is (and what is not) a ‘neuropsychiatric symptom’. Whenever there is a suspicion of a named disorder reflecting brain problems, a genetic disorder or when there are symptoms such as social withdrawal, empathy deficits, psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, confusion), pervasive attention deficits, learning problems, motor control problems, tics (motor or vocal), grossly disturbed eating behaviour, or significant weight loss in children or adolescents, a full neuropsychiatric work-up is always required.

Patients with multiple system atrophy exhibit parkinsonian features and have difficulty with balance and with walking. Cognitive dysfunction includes mainly problems with verbal fluency and executive functioning. The main distinguishing feature of multiple system atrophy is a disturbance in the functioning of the autonomic division of the nervous system, which controls involuntary muscles and fundamental biological functions. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system begins early in the course of multiple system atrophy. Erectile dysfunction and urinary symptoms may be the first signs of this disorder. Later, orthostatic hypotension, sleep-related breathing disorders, and excessive daytime sleepiness are characteristic. Multiple system atrophy is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to death within approximately 10 years of onset.",

      "abstract": "The nervous system is essential for regulating bodily functions and cognitive processes, but it can be affected by complex disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease. Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, and behavior. The pathophysiology involves a combination of genetic, neurochemical, and structural brain abnormalities, particularly in dopaminergic pathways. Epidemiologically, schizophrenia affects about 1% of the global population, typically emerging in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and impaired cognitive function. Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation and the presence of characteristic symptoms over time. Treatment involves antipsychotic medications, psychotherapy, and social support. Complications can include disability, social isolation, and increased risk of substance abuse and suicide. Prevention strategies focus on early intervention and reducing stressors that may trigger or exacerbate symptoms. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting the elderly, characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. The pathophysiology involves the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain, leading to neuronal death and brain atrophy. Epidemiologically, Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia, affecting millions worldwide and increasing in prevalence with age. Symptoms start with mild memory lapses and progress to severe cognitive and functional impairments. Diagnosis is made through clinical assessment, cognitive testing, and imaging studies. There is no cure, but treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine can help manage symptoms. Complications include complete dependence on caregivers, infections, and increased mortality. Prevention focuses on lifestyle modifications like regular exercise, a healthy diet, mental stimulation, and management of cardiovascular risk factors to potentially reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.",

[1-3]\n\nFor the clinician, it is often difficult to arrive at a reliable diagnosis of the neurologic syndrome and to detect the underlying tumor. Neurologic signs and symptoms, although often stereotypic, are not specific. In two-thirds of cases the underlying tumor is not discovered until after the first neurologic symptoms. [4] Furthermore, the neoplasm may be small and difficult to detect. [5-7] PNS are frequently associated with serum autoantibodies reactive with neuronal antigens that are also present in the underlying tumor. These antibodies include (1) the anti-Yo antibody, also called type 1 anti-Purkinje cell antibody (PCA-1), APCA-1, or type I antibody; (2) the anti-Hu antibody, also called type 1 anti-neuronal nuclear antibody (ANNA-1) or type IIa antibody; and (3) the anti-Ri antibody, also called type 2 anti-neuronal nuclear antibody (ANNA-2) or type IIb antibody Table 1.

There are only a few cases of neurosyphilis associated with parkinsonism-plus syndromes (PPSs) that have been reported in the literature. We describe a case of an elderly woman who presented with abnormal gait and progressive visual disturbance, probably secondary to neurosyphilis.Literature search was performed in Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, Scielo, and ScienceDirect using a set of terms that included parkinsonism, tremor, and syphilis.A 64-year-old female was admitted because of vision problems, gait disturbances, and cognitive impairment. The neurological examination revealed bradykinesia, rigidity, and rest tremor. The pupils were bilaterally small and reacted in size to a near object but did not constrict when exposed to bright light. The conjugate eye movements showed a defective downward gaze. On neuropsychological examination, the mini-mental state exam showed a moderate cognitive impairment. Reduced phonemic fluency was observed. A positive serum venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test was noted. A cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed positive VDRL. Brain and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging was normal. An electro-encephalogram showed diffused slow waves. Penicillin G was started. Six months after, the patient had a full recovery of her conjugate eye movements and cognitive functions. Upon further questioning, the patient reported no response with a levodopa attempt.To the authors' knowledge, two individuals developed progressive supra-nuclear palsy (PSP), and one presented corticobasal degeneration (CBD), probably associated with neurosyphilis. This is the second case to document the occurrence of a progressive supra-nuclear palsy because of syphilis.",

      "title": "Attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder impacts the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Recent studies have shown that patients with attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Increased genetic risk for ADHD, measured with ADHD polygenic risk scores (ADHD‐PRS), was associated with a more severe AD presentation, including worse cognitive function and higher tau pathology. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) are common in AD and are hypothesized to occur with disease progression. It is unclear whether ADHD predispose individuals to the development of NPSs. Method We used data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to investigate the associations between ADHD‐PRS and the development of NPSs in cognitively impaired (CI, including MCI and AD) subjects who had brain amyloidosis at baseline. NPSs were assessed with the NPI or NPI‐Q and divided into four syndromes: hyperactive (agitation, disinhibition, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior), psychosis (delusions, hallucinations, and night‐time behavior disturbances), apathy (apathy and appetite and eating abnormalities), and affective (depression and anxiety). Additionally, we tested the specificity of our findings by analyzing the association between the genetic risk for depression, bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with the development of NPSs. Data were represented with Kaplan‐Meier survival curves, and analyses were performed with Cox proportional hazards regression models controlled by age, sex, and ancestry. Result We evaluated data from 852 participants (636 MCI [74.1%], 350 women [40.8%], mean [SD] age of 73.4 [7.3] years). ADHD‐PRS was associated with a higher risk of developing hyperactive (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.04‐1.89) and apathy (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.01‐1.77) symptoms, but not psychosis (HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.78‐1.41) or affective (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.72‐1.32) symptoms. There was no association between the genetic risk for depression, BP, schizophrenia, or ASD with any neuropsychiatric syndrome. Conclusion Findings indicate that a higher genetic risk for ADHD may be a risk factor for the development of hyperactive and apathy symptoms in CI individuals. These effects were specific for ADHD and were not observed for other prevalent psychiatric disorders. Clinically, our results contribute to the literature that highlights the need for tailored assessments for CI individuals with ADHD histories.",

      "abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia and high-risk populations have elevated rates of eye movement abnormalities. However, it is not known whether these abnormalities are specific to eye movements or whether they are also found in more traditional domains of motor control. Most studies examining the motor function of patients with schizophrenia have involved patients treated with medication; abnormalities in motor function could be a result of treatment rather than the disease itself. If motor abnormalities are related to schizophrenia, they should also be found in neuroleptic-naïve patients and possibly in high-risk populations in whom eye movement abnormalities are also observed. We reviewed relevant empirical papers published in the last 35 years. Results suggest that approximately one-fifth of neuroleptic-naïve patients with schizophrenia have increased rates of parkinsonism and neurological soft signs. In high-risk populations, replicated findings include delayed motor development in preschizophrenia subjects, and poor motor skills in the offspring of patients with schizophrenia. In first-degree relatives, increased rates of neurological soft signs were reported. These findings suggest that motor abnormalities are not limited to eye movements and may constitute markers of vulnerability. The literature has several weaknesses that should be addressed in future studies.",

Research in social cognition in schizophrenia has tended to cluster around four types of social cognitive processes: emotion processing, social perception, attributional style, and mental state attribution. Neurocognitive and social cognitive tasks often share cognitive demands, such as working memory and perception. Negative symptoms reflect a decrease or absence of normal functions within two broad domains: internal experience-related impairments, including diminished emotional experience, motivation to engage in productive activities, and desire for social affiliation; expressive or communicative impairments, including diminished facial expressivity, gestures, prosody, and speech production. It has been known for a long time that, neurocognition, negative symptoms are consistent predictors of daily functioning.",

      "abstract": "Cerebrovascular disease is one of the most important problems of clinical neurology, which is a significant cause of cognitive impairment and depression. Chronic forms of cerebrovascular insufficiency are most often associated with cerebral microangiopathy or a disease of small vessels, which is characterized by the presence of lacunae, microinfarction and microbleeding, leukoaraiosis and dilated perivascular spaces. One of the main and most common clinical symptoms is vascular cognitive impairment. They are characterized by extremely variable cognitive deficits, highly dependent on the location and severity of vascular damage. However, clinical manifestations associated with impaired frontal circulation are usually observed. Recent international criteria for vascular cognitive impairment presented by the VASCOG (International Society for Vascular Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders) working group emphasize the particular importance of impaired information processing speed, attention, and/or frontal regulatory functions, often in combination with personality or emotional disorders. The frequency of vascular depression in chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency reaches 70%. The addition of affective disorders significantly aggravates the existing cognitive deficit, increases the risk of dementia. This is due to the fact that depression itself leads to the development of cognitive impairment, causes multiple functional disorders of cerebral microcirculation and a number of other mechanisms. The presence of cerebral microangiopathy underlying this pathology makes the use of drugs with vascular effects in the treatment of these patients. The use of preparations with multimodal action, in particular the combined drug and, is most preferable.",

Sleep initiation, sleep maintenance and terminal insomnia with unrefreshed sleep and disturbing dreams have been consistently reported in the studies of adults with MDD. Hypersomnia has been reported in a subset of adult depressives. Although sleep disturbances may be present throughout all phases of a depressive disorder, they are most severe during an acute episode. Patients with depression who report sleep disturbances are more likely to attempt suicide than those who do not report difficulties with their sleep. Sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep to such a degree that patients may have vegetative symptoms of depression. Thus, it is important when assessing a depressed patient with sleep difficulties to consider a thorough sleep assessment to rule out a physiological cause of vegetative symptoms of depression and insomnia. Those with depression who also exhibit sleep disturbance can benefit from behavioral and relaxation training (1).",

The objective of this review is to refine the reader's approach to history taking, clinical localization and early diagnosis, as well as emergency management of neuromuscular emergencies. Methods An extensive literature search was performed to identify relevant studies. We prioritized meta‐analysis, systematic reviews, and position statements where possible to inform any recommendations. Summary The spectrum of clinical presentations and etiologies ranges from neurotoxic envenomation or infection to autoimmune disease such as Guillain–Barré Syndrome (GBS) and myasthenia gravis (MG). Delayed diagnosis is not uncommon when presentations occur “de novo,” respiratory failure is dominant or isolated, or in the case of atypical scenarios such as GBS variants, severe autonomic dysfunction, or rhabdomyolysis. Diseases of the central nervous system, systemic and musculoskeletal disorders can mimic presentations in neuromuscular disorders. Conclusions Fortunately, early diagnosis and management can improve prognosis. This article provides a comprehensive review of acute presentations in neuromuscular disorders relevant for the emergency physician.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The classical behavioral defects of PD patients involve motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity, as well as non-motor symptoms such as anosmia, depression, and cognitive impairment. Pathologically, the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn)-composed Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) are key hallmarks. Glia are more than mere bystanders that simply support neurons, they actively contribute to almost every aspect of neuronal development and function; glial dysregulation has been implicated in a series of neurodegenerative diseases including PD. Importantly, amounting evidence has added glial activation and neuroinflammation as new features of PD onset and progression. Thus, gaining a better understanding of glia, especially neuron-glia crosstalk, will not only provide insight into brain physiology events but also advance our knowledge of PD pathologies. This review addresses the current understanding of α-syn pathogenesis in PD, with a focus on neuron-glia crosstalk. Particularly, the transmission of α-syn between neurons and glia, α-syn-induced glial activation, and feedbacks of glial activation on DA neuron degeneration are thoroughly discussed. In addition, α-syn aggregation, iron deposition, and glial activation in regulating DA neuron ferroptosis in PD are covered. Lastly, we summarize the preclinical and clinical therapies, especially targeting glia, in PD treatments.",

They include non-rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnias (eg, confusional arousals, sleep terrors, sleepwalking) and REM-related parasomnias (eg, nightmare disorder, REM sleep behavior disorder, sleep paralysis). Notable among these is REM sleep behavior disorder, which is closely linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson disease. Early detection of this disorder is essential because it often precedes the motor symptoms of neurodegenerative conditions. Diagnostic evaluation of parasomnias typically involves polysomnography, in some cases with video monitoring, to differentiate parasomnias from other conditions. Nonpharmacologic treatments, including sleep hygiene and sleep safety measures, are first-line approaches. Cognitive behavior therapy is also effective. Pharmacotherapy may be required in severe cases. Referral to a sleep specialist is recommended for patients with complex or dangerous parasomnias and for patients with frequent sleep paralysis.",

It is characterized by uncomfortable sensations deep in the legs developing at rest that compel the person to move; symptoms are worst at night and sleep disturbance is common. RLS occurs in 7%-11% of the population in Western countries, and many such people experience troublesome symptoms. Primary RLS is familial in up to two thirds of patients. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy. Secondary RLS is most common in those presenting for the first time in later life. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay of systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain. RLS is very responsive to dopaminergic therapies. Rebound of RLS symptoms during the early morning and development of severe symptoms earlier in the day (augmentation) are problematic in those treated for a prolonged period with levodopa. Consequently, dopamine agonists have become first line treatment. Anti-convulsant medications and opioids are helpful in some patients. Correction of underlying problem wherever possible is important in the management of secondary RLS.",

Psychiatric symptoms, including depression and personality change, occur early in the clinical course in about a third of patients, being estimated in some studies that 10% of patients are first admitted to psychiatric wards. Psychiatric symptoms associated with CJD have often lead to erroneous initial diagnoses of functional psychosis, depressive pseudodementia, or hysteria. Analysis of the psychiatric symptoms does not suggest specific features that rapidly allow the differentiation from more common psychiatric disorders, although the occurrence of associated persistent sensory symptoms may raise the possibility of this diagnosis. Later, the characteristic rapidly progressive neurological impairment is decisive in the affirmation of the diagnosis of CJD.",

      "abstract": "The onset and reversibility of major depression is likely to be explained by diffuse neuromodulatory mechanisms rather than permanent abnormalities of connectivity and neurotransmission. However, the expression of mood state appears to involve fronto-striatal mechanisms. Lesions of the ventral frontal cortex give rise to profound modification of affect and behaviour not explained by effects on current intellectual function. These may represent the most extreme possible disturbances of emotional experience. Neuropsychological testing in major depression shows evidence of slowing in motor and cognitive domains with additional prominent effects on mnemonic function most marked in the elderly. Structural imaging with X-ray computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in older patients with major depression shows evidence of structural abnormality compared with controls. These findings are not highly localizing but they tend to confirm the role of cognitive impairment as an important age-related risk factor for major depression. Perfusion or metabolic imaging reflects both reversible changes in function and permanent loss of active neurones. The usual finding has been reductions in anterior brain structures in major depression. Hypoperfusion tends to be greatest in frontal, temporal and parietal areas and most extensive in older (male) patients; high Hamilton scores tend to be associated with reduced uptake. There have also been correlations in the cingulate cortex between increased perfusion and other aspects of the mental state. In general, reductions in frontal areas may be more likely in patients with impoverished mental states. The more prominent impairments of memory are likely to be associated with the finding of impaired temporal function or with a more diffuse failure of neuromodulation.",

      "abstract": "There is little written in the geriatric literature about the concept of psychological frailty which encompasses cognitive, mood, and motivational components. The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is manifested clinically by bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and sometimes rest tremor. The pathological hallmark of PD is the degeneration of dopaminergic cells within the substantia nigra-pars compacta (SNc) and the subsequent dopamine depletion of the striatum. Besides disturbances in motor performance, other symptoms like REM sleep behavior disorder, autonomic dysfunction, depression, and cognitive deficits can play a role in PD. It can be difficult to distinguish PD from other neurodegenerative brain diseases, but early diagnosis is important because prognosis and treatment options differ. Structural imaging is in general not helpful at early disease stages. However, nuclear imaging methods not only can display striatal dopaminergic activity in PD but also visualize brain perfusion and glucose metabolism to show disease-related changes in local brain function or identify cholinergic deficits associated with cognitive dysfunction. Presynaptic dopaminergic imaging either with PET or SPECT is the gold standard to differentiate between patients with parkinsonian features associated with and without a presynaptic dopaminergic deficit. In order to differentiate between PD and other neurodegenerative brain diseases, specific disease-related metabolic patterns identified with FDG-PET imaging could be of great assistance in the individual clinical diagnosis.",

Hearing loss in hemizygous males is bilateral, sensorineural, and moderate to profound; prelingual or postlingual in onset; and progressive or non-progressive. The audiogram shape is variable. Hearing in female carriers can be normal or abnormal. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis relies on the presence of characteristic hearing loss in males and detection of a hemizygous PRPS1 pathogenic variant. Management Treatment of manifestations: Routine management of sensorineural hearing loss. Cochlear implantation can improve auditory and oral communication skills in affected males. Surveillance: Regular audiologic evaluation to assess hearing status and progression of hearing loss. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Evaluate at-risk males at birth with detailed audiometry to assure early diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss. Genetic counseling DFNX1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. The father of an affected male will not have the disorder nor will he be a carrier of the pathogenic variant. If the mother of an affected male has a pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the variant will be affected; females who inherit the variant will be carriers and may have hearing loss. Carrier testing for at-risk female relatives, prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible if the PRPS1 pathogenic variant in the family has been identified.",

Primary parasomnias can be subdivided by the sleep from which they appear, e.g., rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or both.

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

To identify the causes of motor disorders, in addition to studying the anamnesis, it is necessary to conduct a physical examination of the child with the appointment of additional research methods. It is important to remember that developmental delay does not always indicate the presence of any disease but requires dynamic monitoring. However, if they progress, then these patients are more likely to be diagnosed with specific neuromuscular disorders. In this case, the pediatrician should pay attention to the neurological status of the child, assess visual acuity and hearing. At the same time, one should not forget that motor disorders are often combined with a general developmental delay (mental retardation) of the child. Fasciculation of the tongue, loss of motor skills, organomegaly, coarsening of facial features, increased levels of creatine phosphokinase (more than 3 times higher than normal), respiratory failure, in the presence of general weakness, a sharp deterioration in the child’s condition, accompanied by lethargy, vomiting, development of convulsive syndrome, disorders detected on MRI of the brain, are alarming symptoms that require urgent intervention by specialists (neurologist, genetics). Also, some hereditary (chromosomal and monogenic) diseases are often combined with the development of motor disorders.

      "title": "Mental Retardation",
      "abstract": "The American Association on Mental Deficiency recommends that mental retardation be defined as \"significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning resulting in or associated with concurrent impairments in adaptive behavior and manifested during the developmental period.\" While at first glance this definition may appear to be self-evident and innocuous, it was arrived at only after a great deal of discussion and takes into account biological, psychological, social and even economic factors. Particularly important points are the insistence that general intellectual function must be significantly subaverage. Intellectual function here is operationally defined as the results obtained by assessment with one or more individually administered standardized general intelligence tests. With these tests the average IQ is set at 100, and the standard deviation has been found to be 15. Significantly subaverage intellectual function is defined as that which is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean IQ, that is, 70 or below. This upper limit of 70 is meant to be a guideline, and depending upon circumstances it can be extended to 75. Another significant aspect of the definition is that for a person to be classified as mentally retarded, the significantly subaverage intellectual function must be accompanied by impairment in adaptive behavior. This requirement is added in order to avoid inappropriate reliance on, or tyranny of, an IQ number. It is well known that IQ tests may underrepresent a person's potential, such as when a North American IQ test is administered to a person who has been educated in another language or culture. Impairment in adaptive behavior is defined by Grossman as \"significant limitations in an individual's effectiveness in meeting the standards of maturation, learning, personal independence and/or social responsibility that are expected for his or her age level and cultural group, as determined by clinical assessment and, usually standardized scales.\" The developmental period is defined as the period of time between conception and the 18th birthday. The definition of mental retardation is restrictive because we have learned that the inappropriate label of mental retardation may have serious consequences. Simon Olshansky has written: \"To schools the category of mental retardation is a way of classifying some students with learning problems; to the person so labeled the categorization is an attack from which recovery is rarely complete.\"",

      "abstract": "The obvious symptoms of schizophrenia are of cognitive and psychopathological nature. However, schizophrenia affects also visual processing which becomes particularly evident when stimuli are presented for short durations and are followed by a masking stimulus. Visual deficits are of great interest because they might be related to the genetic variations underlying the disease (endophenotype concept). Visual masking deficits are usually attributed to specific dysfunctions of the visual system such as a hypo- or hyper-active magnocellular system. Here, we propose that visual deficits are a manifestation of a general deficit related to the enhancement of weak neural signals as occurring in all other sorts of information processing. We summarize previous findings with the shine-through masking paradigm where a shortly presented vernier target is followed by a masking grating. The mask deteriorates visual processing of schizophrenic patients by almost an order of magnitude compared to healthy controls. We propose that these deficits are caused by dysfunctions of attention and the cholinergic system leading to weak neural activity corresponding to the vernier. High density electrophysiological recordings (EEG) show that indeed neural activity is strongly reduced in schizophrenic patients which we attribute to the lack of vernier enhancement. When only the masking grating is presented, EEG responses are roughly comparable between patients and control. Our hypothesis is supported by findings relating visual masking to genetic deviants of the nicotinic 7 receptor (CHRNA7).",

      "title": "Encephalopathy related to Status Epilepticus during slow Sleep: a link with sleep homeostasis?",
      "abstract": "Encephalopathy related to Status Epilepticus during slow Sleep (ESES) is a childhood epilepsy syndrome characterized by appearance of cognitive and behavioural disturbances in conjunction with a striking activation of EEG epileptic abnormalities during sleep. The link between the extreme amount of epileptic discharges during sleep and the deterioration of cognitive functions and behavior is poorly understood. We hypothesize that the negative effects of ESES may depend on the impairment of the synaptic homeostasis processes occurring during normal sleep and that are particularly important in the developmental age. Sleep ensures synaptic homeostasis by promoting synaptic weakening/elimination after the increase of synaptic strength that occurs during wakefulness. Changes in synaptic strength are reflected in the EEG by changes of sleep slow wave activity (SWA). Recent studies in ESES have failed to show changes of sleep SWA, particularly at the site of the epileptic focus, suggesting a spike-related impairment of the homeostatic recovery of sleep. This impaired synaptic homeostasis in the critical period of development may alter cortical wiring and thereby disrupt, often irreversibly, cognitive functions and behavior, leading to the neuropsychological compromise typical of ESES.",

A host of cognitive and behavioral features can occur with or even precede the onset of motor dysfunction, and the myriad symptoms can make classification challenging. This chapter reviews these conditions through the lens of neuropsychiatric features, while orienting students and providers to the cognitive background of the characteristic motor and imaging findings that co-occur with these diseases. It begins by reviewing conditions caused by abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein, including Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. Characteristic cognitive, motoric, and other symptom presentations are reviewed, along with case examples to help differentiate these conditions. Next, the authors discuss the characteristic cognitive and behavioral features of the atypical parkinsonian conditions known as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal ganglionic degeneration, and conclude with a discussion of the continued diagnostic uncertainties and heterogeneities in the presentation of these types of movement disorders.",

      "title": "Childhood depression: early risk and resilience and introducing solids to infants",
      "abstract": "The carefree exuberance associated with young children can make the concept of childhood depression difficult to imagine. It is not surprising then that the existence of mood disorders in children has gained acceptance only in the last few decades. While debate continues regarding conceptualisations of childhood depression, evidence from over 20 years of research suggests that the major affective disorders often begin early in life. This article will outline current knowledge of childhood depression, including recent etiological evidence and implications. There is no formal diagnostic category specifically for childhood depression, with the mood disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) intended to apply to both adults and children. The key feature of clinical depression is a persistently depressed mood, or pervasive loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. However, for children and adolescents, this mood may be one of irritability rather than sadness. Associated symptoms include feelings of worthlessness, concentration problems, energy loss, and unusual changes in appetite or weight. These symptoms may occur in the context of major depressive disorder, which is marked by acute depressive episodes lasting at least two weeks, or in dysthymic disorder, in which such symptoms persist chronically for at least two years. Also grouped with the mood disorders is bipolar disorder, which is characterised by intermittent manic episodes. While this article focuses on unipolar depression, much of this information may apply to the less understood disorder of bipolar depression also. --------------------- For a number of years there had been some controversy over the appropriate timing of complementary foods to infants. It is with this background that the World Health Organisation (WHO) requested a review of the literature to establish the appropriateness of their recommendations. As a consequence, new guidelines were released in 2001 (WHO, 2001). The new guidelines recommend that complementary foods should be delayed until 6 months. It has been stressed in the literature review, however, that this is a population based recommendation and that infants must be managed individually so that appropriate interventions are provided (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004). By all standards of good nutrition, babies younger than four months who are exclusively breast-fed, or appropriately artificially fed, should not be given solids. The case for delaying complementary foods is based on the health of breast-fed infants and their mothers. The strongest evidence for the recommendation from the infants’ perspective is a reduced incidence of gastrointestinal disease and the absence of any growth deficit. For mothers, the benefit is in prolonged lactational amenorrhoea and greater post-partum weight loss (Kramer & Kakuma, 2004).",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disorder that affects nerve cells in a part of the brain, and results from a progressive loss of dopaminergic and other sub-cortical neurons. Symptoms of Parkinson's disease may include resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, a forward stooped posture, postural instability, and freezing of gait. As reported by several researchers, the forward stooped posture and freezing of gait are the most critical reasons to make the Parkinson's disease patients fall. The main objective of this research is to develop a fall prevention system for Parkinson's disease patients. There are two phases in the fall prevention protocol. The first phase is to detect and recognize the stooped posture and freezing of gait symptoms from the patient's movement activities. The next phase is to alarm an audio cue to break the block of freezing. An accelerometer based sensor network is designed to sense the movement information. The recorded data are transferred to the smartphone, which served as the core calculator unit, by Bluetooth communication protocol. The input signals are recognized and classified into the target symptoms. The main advantages of this proposed approach includes: (1) the safety: to detect the stooped posture and freezing of gait and to produce audio cue to help the patients to break the block; (2) the portability: not limited at specific locations; and (3) the expendability: easy to update or upgrade by using app install online.",

Sometimes, this could already be present at the time of diagnosis for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while it appears in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) almost 10 years after the onset of the disease. The impairment can involve both somatic fibers of the peripheral nervous system, with sensory-motor manifestations, as well as the autonomic system, with neurovegetative multiorgan manifestations through an impairment of sympathetic/parasympathetic conduction. It seems that, both indirectly and directly, the hyperglycemic state and oxygen delivery reduction through the vasa nervorum can determine inflammatory damage, which in turn is responsible for the alteration of the activity of the nerves. The symptoms and signs are therefore various, although symmetrical painful somatic neuropathy at the level of the lower limbs seems the most frequent manifestation. The pathophysiological aspects underlying the onset and progression of DN are not entirely clear. The purpose of this review is to shed light on the most recent discoveries in the pathophysiological and diagnostic fields concerning this complex and frequent complication of diabetes mellitus.",

      "abstract": "Background: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is the stage of an individual’s life in which there can be traced a slight amount of decline in cognitive functioning that comprised of memory and thinking skills. This decay in cognitive functioning does not affect the daily functioning of a patient’s life as it happens in the case of dementia. Objective: To review various forms of screening test measures to assess mild cognitive impairment and its extension towards the gradual onset towards the severe cognitive dysfunctioning such as dementia. Method: There are certain functional impairments that are identical to each other. As far as memory and thinking abilities are concerned, its range may vary from minimal to mild that remains quite unnoticed by the person. Results: Presently, the impact of medication is not so effective for MCI. Regular practices of exercises, mind activity and social involvement may help in decreasing risk of further cognitive function decline. Patients with MCI may carry greater risks of developing dementia as compared to the general population. The present paper discusses various intervention techniques and screening measures to mitigate the prevalence of MCI and to reduce progression of dementia. Conclusion: Prevalence of Mild Cognitive Impairment could be reduced with the primary administration of intervention strategies and technology in order to reduce its progression to dementia. The classification and categorization of MCI in getting broader and clear day by day. The expansion in the use of imaging techniques and other neurological intervention strategies may further enhance the detection of subjects with MCI.",

The underlying disease pathogenesis between these motor and non-motor features share some commonality, with possible candidates including neurotransmitter dysfunction and abnormal amyloid metabolism, in addition to Lewy body burden. This chapter discusses the motor phenotype associated with dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD-D), which includes more axial disease, balance impairment, and greater fall frequency, in addition to sleep disorders and autonomic disturbance. As the milestone of PD-D is reached, deterioration in motor disease and diminished levodopa response is more likely to occur, and this is further explored. Lastly, motor phenotype, specifically the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) phenotype, is discussed in relation to future risk of cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.",

This multidimensional syndrome, which includes cognitive, emotional and behavioral components, is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric features of Parkinson’s disease (PD). It has been established that the prevalence of apathy increases as PD progresses. However, the pathophysiology and anatomic substrate of this syndrome remain unclear. Apathy seems to be underpinned by impaired anatomical structures that link the prefrontal cortex with the limbic system. It can be encountered in the prodromal stage of the disease and in fluctuating PD patients receiving bilateral chronic subthalamic nucleus stimulation. In these stages, apathy may be considered as a disorder of motivation that embodies amotivational behavioral syndrome, is underpinned by combined dopaminergic and serotonergic denervation and is dopa-responsive. In contrast, in advanced PD patients, apathy may be considered as cognitive apathy that announces cognitive decline and PD dementia, is underpinned by diffuse neurotransmitter system dysfunction and Lewy pathology spreading and is no longer dopa-responsive. In this review, we discuss the clinical patterns of apathy and their treatment, the neurobiological basis of apathy, the potential role of the anatomical structures involved and the pathways in motivational and cognitive apathy.",

It is defined as HE without symptoms on clinical/neurological examination but with mild cognitive symptoms and attention deficits that can be characterized by response disinhibition, and with impairments to working memory and visuomotor coordination.2-4 As suggested by Bajaj, et al., these symptoms are considered to reduce the safety2 and quality of life (QOL) of patients with cirrhosis3 and are considered to be a preclinical stage of overt HE.2,3 MHE has a high prevalence of 22 to 80% in patients with liver cirrhosis.2,4 It is a diagnosis that all physicians should be aware of, but there is a fine line between normal and pathological, which can be modified by factors such as education or other comorbidities. At present, many questions remain regarding patients with MHE. Should they receive treatment? What type of treatment should they receive? How long should they receive treatment? Are there preventive measures for these patients? With regard to the first question, several studies have shown a positive effect of treatment on cognitive abilities (Figure 1), quality of life,5 and driving ability (Figure 2),6 but its effect on patients’ ability to work or their risk of falling remains unproven.4 A summary of reports of treatment in MHE and its impact on psychometric variables is presented in table 1, which suggests that treatment should be considered. The next question that arises is the type of treatment that patients with MHE should receive. Many approaches have been proposed, including lactulose, rifaximin and probiotics, minimizing dietary protein, branched-chain amino acids,7 and L-ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA).5 Nonabsorbable disaccharides reduce the synthesis and uptake of ammonia by lowering the pH of the colon and also reduce the uptake of glutamine from the gut.4 Treatment of MHE with lactulose resulted in an absolute risk reduction of 21.7% and the number needed to treat was 4.6. Different studies have compared the use of lactulose with placebo or no in-",

Most patients fulfill criteria for non-amnestic/dysexecutive mild cognitive impairment, even if some cognitive deficits appear unusually severe. Cognitive dysfunction seems stable over time despite marked fluctuations. Evoked potentials may show abnormalities in keeping with central nervous system involvement, with a neurophysiological pattern suggestive of demyelination.

W DLB objawy psychotyczne i zaburzenia poznawcze zazwyczaj poprzedzają wystąpienie objawow zespolu parkinsonowskiego, choc mozliwe jest rownoczesne wystąpienie wszystkich charakterystycznych objawow. Wśrod objawow neuropsychiatrycznych dominują omamy wzrokowe. Cześciej niz w innych chorobach w DLB wystepują objawy zespolu blednego rozpoznawania (pacjent prowadzi rozmowe z lustrem, telewizorem, nie rozpoznaje bliskich osob itp.) oraz zaburzenia zachowania w fazie snu REM. W obrazie neuropsychologicznym choroby obserwuje sie fluktuacje stanu poznawczego, zaburzenia wzrokowo-przestrzenne, deficyty uwagi i funkcji wykonawczych. Zespol parkinsonowski, ktory moze sie pojawic poźno w przebiegu choroby, charakteryzuje sie przede wszystkim spowolnieniem ruchowym, zaburzeniami postawy i sztywnością mieśniową. Ewentualne drzenie ma charakter symetryczny i pozycyjny. Leczenie objawow psychotycznych wymaga szczegolnej ostrozności ze wzgledu na nadwrazliwośc na leki neuroleptyczne.",

All 14 patients had at least average intellectual capacity, but each had demonstrated some academic failure, particularly in arithmetic. Examination revealed neurologic and neuropsychological signs consistent with right-hemisphere dysfunction. Most of the patients avoided eye contact and lacked the gestures and prosody that normally accompany and accentuate speech. Although many of them could not convey their feelings, there was no evidence that they were unable to experience affect. Eight of them reported a family history of similar symptoms. Just as developmental involvement of the left hemisphere may produce dyslexia, damage to the right hemisphere suffered early in life, or inherited, may lead to chronic emotional difficulties, a disturbance of interpersonal skills, and poor visuospatial ability.",

Failure to adequately identify the chief complaint as a visual symptom may lead to incorrect diagnosis or diagnostic delay. A previously healthy, 59-year-old woman presented with a 5-year history of 'losing her stuff'. Upon psychiatric and neuro-ophthalmological evaluation, this symptom was better recognised as a feature of visual agnosia and simultanagnosia. She also presented with multiple previously unrecognised symptoms indicative of higher visual processing dysfunction, such as alexia without agraphia, ocular motor apraxia, optic ataxia, prosopagnosia, akinetopsia and topographagnosia, so further assessment to investigate for PCA was carried out. After a work-up including cognitive assessment, brain structural/functional imaging, and laboratory tests she was diagnosed with visual-variant Alzheimer's disease. Patients with PCA merit a detailed review of their symptoms, as well as the use of office tests such as cognitive evaluation tools, different types of perimetry, colour vision tests, and non-delayed psychiatric consultation for correct management and assessment. This report will emphasise five key aspects to be considered when evaluating patients with PCA",

To discuss the common FDG PET/CT brain imaging patterns seen in atypical parkinsonian disorders. 3. To explain the added benefit of PET/CT of the brain in the evaluation of atypical parkinsonian disorders. The atypical parkinsonian disorders (APD) are a heterogeneous group of movement disorders characterized by prominent parkinsonism. APDs are accompanied by specific additional features such as cerebellar ataxia, early autonomic dysfunction, early dementia, pyramidal tract signs, myoclonus, supranuclear gaze palsy and apraxia, which are not features of idiopathic Parkinson9s disease (PD). Both rapid disease progression and poor or absent response to L-Dopa therapy raise the suspicion of an APD. Multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are the most common causes of APD. Clinical diagnosis of APD can be difficult in early stages. Although the predictive value of the widely established diagnostic criteria is high at first neurological evaluation, the sensitivity tends to be poor. At our institution, we have found that the majority of patients with APD have normal or equivocal brain MRI imaging. FDG PET/CT can provide objective evidence of the underlying brain pathophysiology that can be fit into recognizable patterns of disease. Brain PET/CT with quantification enhances diagnostic sensitivity early in the disease process allowing for potential treatment and prognostication",

      "title": "Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders and anesthesia considerations",
      "abstract": "Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that result from progressive damage to cells and nervous system connections that are essential for mobility, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognition. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Neurological disorders are disorders that involve the brain, spinal cord or nerve and muscle. Children with neurological disorders may have disorders such as epilepsy, developmental delay, cerebral palsy, meningitis, genetic/metabolic diseases or diseases of muscle or nerve such as muscular dystrophy or peripheral neuropathy. These illnesses are frequently severe and potentially have long lasting consequences for the affected children. The pathologies most frequently responsible for psycho-physical disorders can be summarized into three groups: collaboration difficulties (autism spectrum disorders, intellectual impairment, phobia); motor dysfunction (cerebral palsy, epilepsy, other brain pathologies, neuromuscular disorders), and craniofacial anomalies (Down syndrome, other genetic syndromes). Due to their clinical history, and the lack of collaboration, in pediatric non-cooperative patients with Special Needs (SN), the anesthesiological risk may result difficult to assess, despite the fact that they meet the criteria of the outpatient management applied for the patient without disabilities. The perioperative management of pediatric patients with psycho-physical disorders with related relational and cognitive problems must be carefully planned, in order to make the entire hospitalization process as comfortable and as less traumatic as possible. General anesthesia is the most suitable type of anesthesia in pediatric patients with Special Needs (SN), although anesthetic complications are more frequent in these patients, mainly due to comorbidities, taken drugs and anatomical peculiarities. Some studies observed no correlation between multiple anesthesia exposures and neurodevelopmental deficits, while others reported that even a single exposure could increase the risk of deficits. An increased risk of developmental or behavioral disorders as the consequence of surgeries requiring general anesthesia was observed. Based on current studies, it is necessary to endeavor to limit the duration and numbers of anesthesia and the dose of anesthetic agents. The evaluation must include history and physical examination pertaining to the conditions requiring special anaesthetic considerations. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing these neurological disorders in pediatric patients to improve overall quality of life and long-term outcomes.",

LBs and Lewy neurites are insoluble aggregates composed mainly of phosphorylated α-synuclein and can be widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. The distribution of LBs may determine the LBD phenotype. Braak hypothesized that Lewy pathology progresses ascendingly from the peripheral nervous system to the olfactory bulbs and brainstem and then to other brain regions. Braak's PD staging suggests that LBD is a prion-like disease. Most typical PD cases fit with Braak's PD staging, but the scheme fails in some cases. Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, multiple system atrophy, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, cerebrovascular diseases, and essential tremor are common misdiagnoses for pathologically confirmed LBD. LBD exhibits considerable heterogeneity in both clinical and pathological settings, which makes clinical diagnosis challenging.",

Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

Mean age at onset was 62 years; nine of the patients were male.

The RBD was unrelated to psychopathologic conditions but in five cases was closely linked with major neuropathologic disorders: dementia (two), olivopontocerebellar degeneration, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the Guillain-Barré syndrome. Other common polysomnographic abnormalities were high REM density, increased stage 3/4 (slow-wave) sleep, and both periodic and aperiodic limb twitching in non-REM sleep.

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

These basic neurodevelopmental processes are closely related to the developmental mechanisms of primitive functions and their integration or disintegration. In this context, the psychopathological processes that manifest in ADHD are linked to the mechanisms of disturbed inhibitory functions that may cause incongruent neural interactions (\"neural interference\") between the more primitive functions and the higher levels of attentional and cognitive neural processes. These disturbed developmental processes may also determine increased sensitivity to stressful experiences that, in ADHD cases, could lead to the manifestations of various psychopathological symptoms such as disturbed attentional and motor functions, anxiety, and depression, among other cognitive and affective disturbances. These findings, based on previous research, suggest novel framework and hypothesis on how this neurodevelopment-based increased sensitivity to stress stimuli could manifest in the etiopathogenesis of ADHD in its relationship with cognitive, affective, and motor deficits.",

It is different from Alzheimer's disease and has important pharmacotherapeutic implications. Key features include early‐onset, persistent, well‐formed, visual hallucinations and motor features of parkinsonism. Pharmacologic management of neurobehavioral symptoms is complicated by an exaggerated response to neuroleptics, which causes excessive morbidity and mortality. Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies may be particularly responsive to cholinesterase inhibitors. When neurobehavioral symptoms are severe enough to require pharmacologic intervention, it is recommended that agents such as trazodone or cholinesterase inhibitors be considered first‐line therapy. If these fail, neuroleptics may be prescribed with caution.",

      "title": "SCN3A- Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder (SCN3A-ND) encompasses a spectrum of clinical severity associated with epilepsy and/or brain malformation. Affected individuals may have (a) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (i.e., intractable seizures with global developmental delays associated with ongoing epileptiform EEG activity) with or without malformations of cortical development; or (b) malformations of cortical development with or without mild focal epilepsy. Some degree of early childhood developmental delay is seen in all affected individuals; the severity varies widely, ranging from isolated speech delay to severe global developmental delay. Infantile hypotonia is common but may be mild or absent in those without DEE. In those with DEE, seizure onset is typically in the first six to 12 months of life. A variety of seizure types have been described. Seizures remain intractable to multiple anti-seizure medications in approximately 50% of individuals with DEE without malformations of cortical development (MCD) and in 90% of individuals with DEE and MCD. Seizures may be absent or infrequent in those without DEE. Brain MRI findings range from normal to showing thinning or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, to various malformations of cortical development. Autonomic dysregulation, oromotor dysfunction leading to the need for gastrostomy tube placement, progressive microcephaly, hyperkinetic movement disorder, and cortical visual impairment can also be seen in those with DEE. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN3A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Empiric treatment of seizures with standard anti-seizure medications (no specific anti-seizure medication has been shown to be more efficacious than another); feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube placement in those with dysphagia; standard treatment for developmental delay / intellectual disability, spasticity, hyperkinetic movements, autonomic dysfunction, and central visual impairment. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters; evaluation for signs/symptoms of a movement disorder or autonomic dysfunction; monitor for new seizures or changes in seizures; assessment of developmental progress, educational needs, behavioral issues, mobility and self-help skills; annual ophthalmology evaluation to assess for visual impairment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: There is no evidence that specific anti-seizure medications can worsen seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. There is no evidence that sleep deprivation or fever exacerbate seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment. Pregnancy management: Use of anti-seizure medication during pregnancy reduces the risk for mortality during pregnancy, but exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). The risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from anti-seizure medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling SCN3A-ND is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of probands diagnosed with SCN3A-ND have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the SCN3A pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the SCN3A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

The magnitude of the deviations increases with clinical severity. Different disorders are characterized by distinctive profiles of abnormal values of brain electrical features. Computerized differential classification of some of these disorders can be achieved with high accuracy. Such classification, providing objective corroboration of brain dysfunctions, may be a useful adjunct to psychiatric diagnosis, which relies primarily on subjective clinical impressions.

      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness. This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed.",

      "title": "Sleep and circadian difficulties in schizophrenia: presentations, understanding, and treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is common in mental health care to ask about people’s days but comparatively rare to ask about their nights. Most patients diagnosed with schizophrenia struggle at nighttime. The next-day effects can include a worsening of psychotic experiences, affective disturbances, and inactivity, which in turn affect the next night’s sleep. Objective and subjective cognitive abilities may be affected too. Patients commonly experience a mix of sleep difficulties in a night and across a week. These difficulties include trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping at all; nightmares and other awakenings; poor-quality sleep; oversleeping; tiredness; sleeping at the wrong times; and problems establishing a regular sleep pattern. The patient group is also more vulnerable to obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. We describe in this article how the complex presentation of non-respiratory sleep difficulties arises from variation across five factors: timing, mental state, need for sleep, self-care, and environment. We set out 10 illustrative patterns of such difficulties experienced by patients with non-affective psychosis. These sleep problems are eminently treatable with intensive psychological therapy delivered over approximately eight sessions. We describe key techniques and their typical order of implementation by presentation. Sleep problems are an important issue for patients. Giving them the therapeutic attention patients often desire brings both real clinical benefits and improves views of services. Treatment is also very likely to lessen psychotic experiences and mood disturbances while improving daytime functioning and quality of life. Tackling sleep difficulties can be a route toward the successful treatment of psychosis.",

      "title": "Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The term \"brain death\" (BD) is used to indicate a clinical situation characterized by the irreversible loss of all brain functions; the identification of this condition is closely linked to the development of intensive care medicine that, with mechanical ventilation, allows the maintenance of somatic functions even when cerebral functions are ceased. BD diagnosis is essentially based on the presence of three cardinal clinic criteria: 1) coma or unresponsiveness, 2) absence of brainstem reflexes 3) absence of spontaneous breathing, evaluated with apnea test. For BD diagnosis the following prerequisites must be scrupolously considered: knowledge of the proximate cause of coma and confirmation of its irreversibility; exclusion of confounding clinical variables (severe electrolyte, acid-base, endocrine disturbances); hypothermia and/or hypotension; drug intoxication or poisoning. Ancillary tests used in BD confirmation are represented by neurophysiological methods to highlight the loss of bioelectrical brain activity (EEG, evoked potential (EP)) and methods for demonstration of cerebral circulatory arrest (TransCranial Doppler (TCD); Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT); conventional Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA); CT angiography; MRI angiography). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ancillary tests are able to confirm the complete cessation of all brain functions and then, in adults, ancillary tests are not needed for the clinical diagnosis of brain death and they should never replace the clinical neurological examination. However, even though ancillary tests are not mandatory but only optional in many countries, they continue to be used, especially when there are factors that may interfere with the complete clinical assessment or when apnea test cannot be performed. Although BD is a relatively simple clinical diagnosis, there are substantial differences in perceptions and practices regarding its declaration among countries, states and even between hospitals worldwide. There are also cultural and religious obstacles—especially in lower-income countries—to the determination of death with neurologic criteria, which lead to the suspension of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, health organizations should implement educational campaigns to improve knowledge and awareness of current criteria among the population, and national and international scientific societies should also make every efforts to validate and standardize clinical and laboratory criteria. Finally, it should reminded and underlined that the ultimate purpose of brain death determination should be to increase the number of organs donated, to improve the quality of life of organ recipients.",

Because neurodegenerative diseases have patterns of brain atrophy that are much clearer than those of psychiatric disorders, they may provide a window into the neural bases of common emotional and behavioral symptoms. We discuss five common symptoms that occur in both neurodegenerative disease and psychopathology (i.e., anxiety, dysphoric mood, apathy, disinhibition, and euphoric mood) and their associated neural circuitry. We focus on two neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia) that are common and well characterized in terms of emotion, cognition, and social behavior and in patterns of associated atrophy. Neurodegenerative diseases provide a powerful model system for studying the neural correlates of psychopathological symptoms; this is supported by evidence indicating convergence with psychiatric syndromes (e.g., symptoms of disinhibition associated with dysfunction in orbitofrontal cortex in both frontotemporal dementia and bipolar disorder). We conclude that neurodegenerative diseases can play an important role in future approaches to the assessment, prevention, and treatment of mental illness.",

      "title": "Alteraciones cognitivas y lingüísticas en la enfermedad de Parkison",
      "abstract": "La Enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es una enfermedad neurodegenerativa caracterizada principalmente por sintomas motores (rigidez, bradicinesia, temblor en reposo) que aparece por una perdida de dopamina en el circuito que conecta los ganglios basales con la corteza cerebral y por la aparicion de depositos de Lewy en diferentes regiones cerebrales. Aunque el origen de la EP es parcialmente desconocido, han sido descubiertos algunos genes que estan involucrados en su aparicion, pero que explican solamente un pequeno porcentaje de los casos. En las ultimas decadas, el interes por los sintomas no motores (SNM) de la enfermedad ha ido creciendo progresivamente. El deterioro cognitivo leve (DCL) es uno de estos sintomas que puede aparecer incluso desde los inicios de la enfermedad y en algunos casos, evolucionar hasta la demencia. El perfil cognitivo de estos pacientes suele caracterizarse por dificultades ejecutivas, aunque tambien es frecuente encontrar deficits de memoria, de habilidades visuoespaciales, de procesamiento emocional y del lenguaje.En el caso del lenguaje, las alteraciones pueden afectar tanto al procesamiento de mas alto nivel como la pragmatica o la comprension de oraciones, hasta el procesamiento lexico-semantico. Sin embargo, aun hay controversia acerca del origen de estos deficits. Diferentes estudios han tratado de conocer si el deficit es puramente linguistico o si por el contrario es secundario a las alteraciones cognitivas presentes en los pacientes, o incluso si existe relacion con el trastorno motor y/o los niveles de dopamina cerebral.El objetivo principal de esta Tesis es conocer el perfil cognitivo de un grupo de pacientes con EP sin demencia asi como las alteraciones linguisticas que pueden presentar, principalmente de los verbos.La hipotesis de partida es que los pacientes con EP muestran deficits cognitivos y en el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales en ausencia de demencia objetivados con pruebas neuropsicologicas. En cuanto a los trastornos del lenguaje, la hipotesis principal de este trabajo es que los pacientes con EP sin demencia presentan deficits linguisticos en el procesamiento de los verbos que aumentan con la retirada de la medicacion dopaminergica. Para poner a prueba estas hipotesis, llevamos a cabo 5 estudios distintos. En el primer trabajo participaron 50 pacientes con EP y 42 controles sanos. En el segundo, 40 pacientes con EP y 19 controles, en ambos, los pacientes fueron evaluados con una extensa bateria neuropsicologica y en el segundo se incluyeron mas tareas linguisticas y una de reconocimiento de expresiones faciales. En el tercer estudio, una muestra de 49 pacientes con EP y 19 controles realizaron una tarea de denominacion de acciones en la que se controlo el contenido motor de los dibujos que tenian que denominar. En los experimentos cuatro y cinco, 20 pacientes fueron evaluados con la misma tarea de denominacion de acciones (estudio cuatro) y con cuatro tareas de fluidez verbal (estudio cinco), mientras estaban con y sin los efectos de la medicacion dopaminergica.Los resultados encontrados han sido publicados en cinco articulos y pueden resumirse de la siguiente manera:En el primer articulo (Rodriguez-Ferreiro, Cuetos, Herrera, Menendez & Ribacoba, 2010) se encontro que la muestra con EP sin demencia presentaba dificultades en tareas que evaluaban funciones ejecutivas, atencion, orientacion temporal, memoria inmediata, fluidez semantica, denominacion de personajes famosos y denominacion de acciones. En el segundo articulo (Herrera, Cuetos & Rodriguez-Ferreiro, 2011), encontramos diferencias significativas en la fluidez semantica, la fluidez de acciones, la denominacion de acciones, la denominacion de personajes famosos, la atencion y el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales. Los analisis de regresion mostraron que la tarea de reconocimiento de expresiones era la que mejor diferenciaba entre el grupo de EP y el grupo control. Ademas la distribucion de este deficit era similar tanto para los pacientes con DCL como para los pacientes con funciones cognitivas normales. Centrandonos en las alteraciones del lenguaje, en el tercer articulo (Herrera, Rodriguez-Ferreiro & Cuetos, 2012) se observo que los pacientes cometen mas errores a la hora de denominar dibujos que tienen un alto contenido motor en comparacion con aquellos de bajo contenido motor, mientras que los controles tenian un rendimiento similar en ambas categorias. Los resultados del cuarto articulo con pacientes con y sin medicacion (Herrera & Cuetos, 2012), mostraron que mientras en los pacientes con medicacion, los tiempos de reaccion (TR) eran similares para ambos tipos de dibujos, en los EP off, los TR eran significativamente mas lentos para los dibujos con un alto contenido motor. Por ultimo, los resultados obtenidos en el quinto estudio (Herrera, Cuetos & Ribacoba, 2012) muestran que los pacientes off medicacion generan significativamente menos palabras en las tareas que dependen de las zonas frontales (fluidez fonologica y de acciones). Y lo mas interesante es que en el caso de la fluidez de acciones, los pacientes off medicacion generaron verbos significativamente mas frecuentes que en on o que los generados por el grupo control.Los resultados sugieren que es posible encontrar deficits cognitivos en pacientes con EP sin demencia o quejas subjetivas de deterioro en los estadios iniciales de la enfermedad. Ademas estas dificultades no solo se relacionan con las tareas ejecutivas, sino que tambien aparecen problemas semanticos. Aparte de los deficits cognitivos, es posible encontrar problemas relacionados con el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales, independientes a la presencia de DCL.En cuanto a los trastornos linguisticos, los EP muestran un deficit especifico en el procesamiento de los verbos evaluado tanto con tareas de denominacion de acciones como de fluidez verbal. En el caso de la denominacion de acciones, el deficit parece tener un origen semantico, pues las dificultades aumentan al denominar acciones con mayor contenido motor que es mas acusado en los pacientes en los que el trastorno motor es mas severo (cuando estan sin medicacion). Estos datos sugieren que las mismas areas encargadas de planificar y ejecutar los movimientos estan implicadas, al menos en parte, en el procesamiento de los verbos de accion. Ademas la dopamina tambien parece jugar un papel importante en la activacion del sistema lexico-semantico de los verbos, pues cuando los pacientes se encuentran sin los efectos de la medicacion, solo pueden acceder a aquellos verbos que tienen mayor frecuencia lexica y por tanto estan mas accesibles.En definitiva, los resultados presentados muestran que los pacientes con EP sin demencia, presentan deficits cognitivos, de reconocimiento de expresiones faciales y dificultades relacionadas con el procesamiento de los verbos.",

      "abstract": "Prion diseases are rapidly progressive fatal conditions caused by abnormally shaped proteins. Sporadic Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease (sCJD) is the most common human prion disorder accounting for 85-90 % of cases. Clinical manifestations include rapidly evolving dementia in conjunction with neurological symptoms such as ataxia, myoclonus, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. However, the early symptoms of the disease are often non-specific and mental disorder is delayed, making the diagnostic process difficult and challenging.We present 3 cases with atypical early symptoms and late onset of cognitive decline. The first case presented with isolated visual symptoms (Heidenhain variant), the second patient had isolated anomic aphasia and the third one non-convulsive status epilepticus. A review of the past literature concerning the atypical and rare early clinical features of the sCJD was conducted.The following manifestations were found: psychiatric and visual symptoms, which are relatively common, epileptic seizures, otologic symptoms and presentation of sCJD as an acute vascular event. Moreover, language, communication and writing impairments, movement disorders, symptoms from the peripheral nervous system and bulbar signs were reported as well.Increased clinical suspicion, along with the aid of existing diagnostic methods and the development of novel techniques could contribute to a better understanding of the disease's pathophysiology, early and accurate diagnosis and improvement of patient management.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The Landau–Kleffner syndrome (LKS) and electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES) are rare childhood‐onset epileptic encephalopathies in which loss of language skills occurs in the context of an epileptiform EEG activated in sleep. Although in LKS the loss of function is limited to language, in ESES there is a wider spectrum of cognitive impairment. The two syndromes are distinct but have some overlap. The relationship between the epileptiform EEG abnormalities and the loss of cognitive function remains controversial, even in LKS which is the most widely accepted as an acquired epileptic aphasia. Language regression also occurs in younger children, frequently in the context of a more global autistic regression. Many of these children have epileptiform EEGs. The term autistic regression with epileptiform EEG has been proposed for these children. Whether these children are part of an extended LKS spectrum is very controversial, because there are differences in age of onset, clinical phenotype, and EEG findings. An understanding of the available data on clinical characteristics, EEG findings, pathology, prognosis, and treatment of these syndromes is essential for further progress in this area.

Desarrollo. El insomnio es un trastorno que se presenta como una dificultad para iniciar o mantener el sueno. La etiologia del insomnio infantil presenta causas multifactoriales. Para poder comprender y diagnosticar el insomnio en la infancia es necesario conocer los mecanismos que intervienen en la genesis de la vigilia y del sueno y considerar la existencia de otros tipos de trastornos. El insomnio se presenta como un desequilibrio entre la inhibicion de los sistemas que mantienen el estado de vigilia y de aquellos otros encargados de activar los sistemas generadores del sueno. En el nino, este desequilibrio depende de la situacion de inmadurez funcional propia de cada edad. El insomnio infantil aparece, mas que como una falta de sueno, como una falta de adecuacion entre el ritmo y la necesidad de sueno propia del nino y su entorno familiar y social. La causa mas habitual del insomnio es ambiental, conductual y de orden psicologico. Ante esta situacion, el diagnostico del insomnio infantil se basa en determinar un diagnostico diferencial con parasomnias, trastornos motores del sueno y del despertar. Conclusiones. El insomnio infantil plantea problemas para identificar sus causas, para diferenciar entre el autentico insomnio y otros trastornos del sueno y para su resolucion, debido a la influencia que el ambiente y la conducta del nino tienen sobre el sueno.",

Cognitive deficits and sleep difficulties are normal age-related changes, may explain an elderly patient's complaints about sleep. There are also a variety of other diagnoses that must be considered, including the presence of specific sleep disorders, circadian rhythm disturbances, and medical and psychiatric co-morbidities. There are also several less common presentations of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) that can be found in the elderly, which include complaints of insomnia, nocturnal confusion, and daytime cognitive impairment such as short-term memory loss and poor concentration. As with younger patients, sleep complaints in older patients should be evaluated with a thorough sleep history and often an overnight sleep study. The appropriate diagnosis or identification of specific, often reversible or correctable factors contributing to an elderly patient's sleep complaint can result in significant improvements in quality of life and daytime functioning.",

The motor milestones were delayed. Median developmental quotient level was 26. All patients but 1 experienced predominantly polymorphic seizures. In 4 cases, the epilepsy was refractory to treatment. The EEG of all patients displayed an abnormal sleep pattern and generalized abnormalities, with a maximum over the posterior areas.Milder or less typical phenotypes of AS may remain undiagnosed, leading to an overall underdiagnosis of the disease. The EEG shows no clear relation to genotype, clinical picture, or to the presence and severity of epilepsy.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Anti-Ma2 encephalitis is a rare neurological disorder with a predominant involvement of brainstem, limbic and diencephalic structures. Although an unspecific encephalopathy is the usual form of presentation, acute-onset neurologic symptoms and other atypical manifestations have been described and account for the challenging diagnosis of this entity. Despite being usually detected as a paraneoplastic syndrome in patients with early-stage tumors or without a previous history of malignancy, a growing concern has arisen from several cases reported in metastatic patients under treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We report what to our knowledge is the first known case of anti-Ma2 encephalitis associated to pembrolizumab and presenting as an acute-onset focal neurological syndrome, consisting on acute global aphasia, right upper limb paresia, hypoacusia, sleep disorder, decreased conscious level and a motor focal status that was refractory to anticonvulsant therapy. A brain MRI scan showed a focal alteration of the cortical-subcortical signal on the left parietal lobe. CSF study found a significant hyperproteinorrhachia and electroencephalography showed lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs), suggestive of a diffuse encephalopathy. A positive result for anti-Ma2 antibodies was obtained both in blood and CSF samples through indirect immune-fluorescence (IFI) and later confirmed by western-blot technique. Our patient obtained a mild response to steroid therapy and a significant improvement after the administration of intravenous immunoglobulins. The hypothesis that checkpoint inhibitors may trigger the expression of previously subclinical paraneoplastic events, through the strengthening of cytotoxic T cells-mediated immune response, is supported by our finding of preexisting anti-Ma2 antibodies in preserved blood samples obtained before the initiation of pembrolizumab in our patient. Further research is needed to reveal if the detection of onconeural antibodies prior to a treatment with checkpoint inhibitors may be used as a predictive biomarker of neurologic immune-related high-grade toxicity.",

Patients with FND often present acutely, particularly with dissociative seizures (resembling epilepsy) or persistent weakness resembling a stroke. History and careful observation and examination are critical to diagnosis, as investigations will often be normal or non-contributory. The nature of convulsive movements in dissociative seizures often differs from that in epilepsy, and long duration of individual events, waxing and waning, closed eyes and high reported frequency in an apparently well individual are all suggestive. In those with stroke-like episodes, demonstration of normal power even briefly (eg Hoover's sign, 'give way' weakness) together with distractability are positive physical features indicating a functional disorder. A positive diagnosis and clear non-judgemental explanation, backed up by reliable information sources associated with prompt onward referral to a neurologist can greatly reduce distress and ultimately improve outcomes.",

Decline in visual, visuoperceptual and cognitive functions do occur in pwMS, but it is unclear to what extend those help us understand visual complaints. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to explore the relation between visual complaints and decline in visual, visuoperceptual and cognitive functions, to optimize care for pwMS. Visual, visuoperceptual and cognitive functions of 68 pwMS with visual complaints and 37 pwMS with no or minimal visual complaints were assessed. The frequency of functional decline was compared between the two groups and correlations were calculated between visual complaints and the assessed functions. Decline in several functions occurred more frequently in pwMS with visual complaints. Visual complaints may be an indication of declined visual or cognitive functioning. However, as most correlations were not significant or weak, we cannot infer that visual complaints are directly related to functions. The relationship may be indirect and more complex. Future research could focus on the overarching cognitive capacity that may contribute to visual complaints. Further research into these and other explanations for visual complaints could help us to provide appropriate care for pwMS.",

      "abstract": "Parkinsonism plus syndrome is a group of heterogeneous degenerative neurological disorders, which differ from the classical idiopathic Parkinson's disease in certain associated clinical features, poor response to levodopa, distinctive pathological characteristics and poor prognosis. Associated clinical features include symmetrical onset, infrequent or atypical tremor, prominent rigidity in axial musculature, bradykinesia, early postural instability, supranuclear gaze palsy, early autonomic failure, pyramidal affection, cerebellar involvement, alien limb phenomenon, apraxia and significant early cognitive dysfunction in some cases. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy body disease (DLB) are commoner disorders. Less frequent disorders are cortico-basal ganglionic degeneration (CBGD), frontotemporal dementia with chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), Pick's disease, parkinsonian-dementia complex of Guam, Pallidonigral degeneration, Wilson's disease and a rigid variant of Huntington's disease. During the last 3 decades, major progress has been made in understanding PSP, CBGD and FTDP-17, which are tau disorders. MSA and DLB together with idiopathic Parkinson's disease are called alpha-synucleinopathies. Recent studies show that the diagnosis of these Parkinsonism plus syndromes improves when strict diagnostic criteria are used. However, unusual presentations may pose a diagnostic challenge. The shortcomings of the current studies demand the need for further research to identify biologic markers that may allow earlier diagnosis, and understanding of the factors leading to alpha-synuclein or tau aggregation. Identification of therapeutic strategies that may prevent the aggregation of these proteins and rescue dysfunctional cells has been stressed. This review focuses on the advances in the clinical, neuroimaging, pathologic, genetic and management aspects of these disorders.",

Functional imaging studies suggest that selective cardiac sympathetic denervation may occur early in PD but not in other parkinsonian syndromes. The clinical implication of this apparently disease specific peripheral dysautonomia is unknown and would be the subject of much interest in future years. Dysautonomia in degenerative disorders also affect respiration, genitourinary function and sleep. Sleep related disorders such as rapid eye movement behaviour disorder and urinary voiding dysfunction appear to precede the development of PD related symptoms while patients with sporadic ataxia have been shown to progress to develop MSA. Dysautonomia has also been recognised in other movement disorders, examples being the combination of dystonia and complex regional pain syndrome with elevated HLA-DR13 and late onset Huntington's disease presenting with dominant parkinsonism and minimal chorea. These studies have helped progress in various diagnostic and management parameters in relation to autonomic dysfunction and movement disorders.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital body function, regulating several biological phenomena. Deprivation studies are one of the ways used to examine the physiological functions and the regulation of the sleep. Sleep deprivation is a stressor, and its’ effects depend on an individual’s prior sleep deficit and distribution during the day. Sleep deprivation can be partial, total, acute, or chronic or specifically focused on one of the sleep phases. Sleep deprivation affects a large spectrum of vital systems such as thermoregulation, energy and mineral balance, and immunofunction. Based on the fact that sleep is a very important process for the normal development of many metabolic pathways, it is logical to think that insomnia has serious organism consequences. Functional irregularities of different organs are always reflected in structural changes that can be identified with imaging techniques. Imaging methods can also help identify problems of animals insomnia.",

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

However, the sexual problems affecting women with neurological disease are not well described. The etiology of female sexual dysfunction in neurological conditions is multifactorial. There are both psychological and physiological etiologies that can be difficult to separate. The more common psychological problems arise from difficulty adapting to a chronic, and sometimes progressive, illness. Physiological causes of sexual dysfunction in neurological disease include disruption of regions of the cerebral cortex mediating sexual behavior and response; neuroendocrine or neurochemical dysfunction; and motor, sensory, or autonomic neuropathy Sexual dysfunction may be a consequence of the neurological disease or the pharmacologic therapy.

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a long-term neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of dopaminergic neuronal loss and dysfunction in the substantia nigra. Motor disturbance is the symptom most typically reported, including bradykinesia plus either limb rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability [1–3]. Importantly, it has been reported that at the point when the patient meets criteria for the principal of motor disturbance, approximately 60% of substantia nigra neurons are lost [4]. Non-motor symptoms have also been observed in both PD patients as well as in related animal models, including pain, autonomic dysfunction, depression, anxiety, olfactory dysfunction, cognitive impairment and sleep disorders [5,6]. The presence and severity of these non-motor symptoms as the disease progresses exacerbate the degree of disability of PD patients. These non-motor symptoms suggest that neurodegenerative processes in PD extends beyond the substantia nigra and dopaminergic deficit [6–10]. It has been noted that before PD becomes clinically significant, neurodegeneration has been ongoing for some time. This has led to the notion of a “pre-motor” phase [11], during which non-motor manifestations and a variety of other abnormalities may offer key biomarkers of the disease process.",

Later, she developed abnormal jerky movements in her left arm and mutism. Her medical history was unremarkable for previous surgeries, drugs or systemic diseases, and family history was negative for dementia or prion disease. Neurological examination showed marked cognitive impairment, myoclonus on the left side, left hemiparesis and brisk reflexes. Based on the clinical features, a thorough workup for rapidly progressive dementia syndrome was performed. All blood tests were normal. Routine CSF analysis showed no abnormality in cell count and chemistry. Her EEG was strikingly abnormal and revealed periodic 1–2 Hz sharp wave complexes, with a generalised distribution in both hemispheres (figure 1). Diffusion-weighted MRI showed water restriction in right frontal and parietal lobes ('ribbon sign' and bilateral caudate nuclei (figure 2).",

A mild form of sleepiness can be associated with reduced reactivity and modest distractibility symptoms, but more severe symptomatic forms are characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrollable need to sleep, causing sudden sleep attacks, amnesia and automatic behaviors. The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The developmental amnesia is a recently known entity that occurs as a consequence of hypoxic-ischemic events in the perinatal period. This is a specific deficit of episodic memory with greater preservation of semantic memory and other memory components such as the immediate and working memory. It occurs in patients without apparent neurological sequelae, with normal psychomotor development and general intelligence. The developmental amnesia has been associated with bilateral involvement of the hippocampus, which is evident in some cases on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as signal disturbance and signs of atrophy, or reduced size of the hippocampus in brain volumetric studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS We present six observations of developmental amnesia, their clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings. RESULTS All of them show impaired episodic memory with preservation of semantic memory, have a normal general intelligence and follow a regular school with special educational needs. CONCLUSIONS It is necessary to keep in mind this entity in monitoring risk newborns by their perinatal history and include the exploration of memory in neuropsychological study of these subjects. On the other hand, we highlight the specificity of the clinical and neuropsychological profile for the diagnosis of developmental amnesia even in the absence of hippocampal lesions on conventional MRI.",

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

The answer may be found in congenital “Monophtalme” syndrome which appears during the first months of life with severe unilateral congenital organic amblyopia. The vision of the “sound” eye does not develop normally because there is no symmetrical binocular stimuli during these first few months of life. The fixation thus remains immature with an attraction of the fixation-pursuit system towards adduction. The clinical complications that result are: (a) a preference towards adduction which induces a torticollis; (b) a manifest/latent nystagmus (Drift/Adduction) of variable intensity with impaired vision in the Primary Position (PP). The more severe the organic defect, the more pronounced the visual functional defect of the viewing eye. Very early cataract extraction seems to attenuate the symptoms, probably because it allows more symmetrical (light?) retinal stimuli during the development of monocular fixation.",

      "title": "Night eating syndrome: implications for severe obesity",
      "abstract": "Night eating syndrome (NES) was first identified in 1955 by Stunkard, a psychiatrist specialising in eating disorders (ED). Over the last 20 years considerable progress has been made in defining NES as a significant clinical entity in its own right and it has now been accepted for inclusion in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) due for publication in 2013. NES is considered a dysfunction of circadian rhythm with a disassociation between eating and sleeping. Core criteria include a daily pattern of eating with a significantly increased intake in the evening and/or night time, as manifested by one or both of the following: at least 25% of food intake is consumed after the evening meal or at least two episodes of nocturnal eating per week. An important recent addition to core criteria includes the presence of significant distress and/or impairment in functioning. Stunkard's team recommend further investigation on the pathogenesis of NES, in particular its relationship with traumatic life events, psychiatric comorbidity, the age of onset of NES and course of NES over time. The relationship between NES and other ED also requires further clarification as night-eaters exhibit some features of other ED; previous guidance to separate NES from other ED may have hindered earlier characterisation of NES. Evidence from European and American studies suggests NES features strongly in populations with severe obesity. The complex interplay between depression, impaired sleep and obesity-related comorbidity in severely obese individuals makes understanding NES in this context even more difficult. This review examines evidence to date on the characterisation of NES and concludes by examining the applicability of current NES criteria to individuals with severe obesity.",

      "abstract": "Disturbances in sleep and wakefulness are important symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and are associated with negative effects on patients' quality of life. The analysis of literature on the relationship between RLS and PD revealed three main hypotheses explaining the relatively high incidence of RLS in PD: (1) RLS can be considered as an early (prodromal) manifestation or a predictor of PD that can outpace its main symptoms by several years (by analogy with conduct disorder during sleep with REM); (2) the high incidence of RLS in the advanced stage of PD may be associated with augmentation of previously latent RLS symptoms during prolonged dopaminergic therapy of PD; (3) a significant proportion of RLS cases in PD patients are not «classical» RLS, but represent, for example, manifestations of motor or non-motor fluctuations or a special form of stereotypy in the legs. Further research is needed to determine if any of these statements are true.Нарушения сна и бодрствования являются важными симптомами болезни Паркинсона (БП), которые отрицательно влияют на качество жизни пациентов. Проведенные в обзоре данные свидетельствуют о существовании трех основных гипотез, касающихся взаимоотношения СБН и БП. Согласно первой из них СБН можно рассматривать как раннее (продромальное) проявление или предиктор БП, способный опережать ее основные симптомы на несколько лет (по аналогии с расстройством поведения во сне с БДГ); в соответствии со второй гипотезой, высокая частота СБН на развернутой стадии БП может быть связана с аугментацией ранее латентных симптомов СБН на фоне длительной дофаминергической терапии БП; третья гипотеза допускает, что значительная часть случаев СБН у пациентов с БП не является «классическим» СБН, а представляет собой, например, проявления моторных или немоторных флуктуаций либо особой формы стереотипии в ногах. Дальнейшие исследования необходимы, чтобы определить, является ли хотя бы одно из этих утверждений верным.",

      "abstract": "Is there a disturbance of the central nervous system (CNS) that underlies the disturbed behavior of some hyperactive children? Results from four studies are presented that suggest that some hyperactive children may be characterized as having a low CNS arousal level. Evidence from animal and human neurophysiological studies suggests that this low arousal level may be accompanied by low levels of inhibition in the CNS. A neurophysiological model of low CNS arousal and inhibition, explains in part the hyperactive child's disorganized and disruptive behavior. The essence of this model is lack of inner controls over motor output and sensory input, resulting in behavioral and learning problems. Stimulant medications are viewed as restoring both CNS arousal and inhibitory levels to normal, providing the child with better controls and permitting a wider range of behavioral patterns.",

This article reviews the most recent and relevant contributions on cognitive, neuropsychological and behavioural outcomes, and the neuroradiological findings in extremely and very preterm infants. In the first 2 years of life, cognitive impairment is common: it has an incidence of 30–40% and a higher prevalence than neuromotor and neurosensorial impairments. Recent studies report that even preterm infants with no major disabilities at preschool age perform more poorly than term peers in multiple neuropsychological domains, such as language, attention, memory, visuomotor and visuospatial processing and executive functions.The incidence and severity of problems increase with decreasing gestational age. A delayed acquisition of neuropsychological functions and/or the occurrence of behavioural problems at preschool age are likely to be predictive of the high rate of cognitive deficits at school age and in adolescence. Neuropsychological functions across multiple developmental domains should be assessed longitudinally during routine follow-up checks.",

Neurological deficits and epilepsy were common, particularly in those with severe intellectual deficit and with acquired brain damages. Intellectual level prognosis was usually good, although lower than in a healthy population: 75% of children had full intellectual quotient (FIQ) higher than 70 but often, there was an heterogeneous pattern of the IQ with greater differences between verbal and performance results because of poor visual-spatial skills. Attention and syntax comprehension of language disabilities were also specifically encountered. Meningitis or toxoplasmosis secondary to hydrocephalus often resulted in a poor intelligence level but other causes did not influence intelligence level or pattern. Visual-spatial deficits, attention disorders and language disabilities did not seem related to the degree of hydrocephalus or the delay before shunting, but were especially encountered when ventricular dilatation persisted in spite of the operation. Functional amblyopias were frequent, certainly related to strabismus. Optic atrophy was rare and linked to direct compression of the optic nerves or to major and repeated episodes of intracranial hypertension.",

Despite the experimental work which has been reported on the subject there is little accurate knowledge concerning the essential basis of the phenomena of sleep or concerning the real effects of disturbances of the rhythm of sleep. Stories concerning death produced by continued wakefulness or of mental disease produced by long vigils have been current for many years. There are, however, no actually observed cases recorded in the medical literature which clearly indicate that extended vigils produce either mental disease or death.

It is defined as a disturbance of consciousness and cognition that develops suddenly and fluctuates over time. Delirious patients can become hyperactive, hypoactive, or both. The occurrence of delirium during hospitalization is associated with increased in-hospital and long-term morbidity and mortality. The cause of delirium is multifactorial and may include imbalances in neurotransmitters, inflammatory mediators, metabolic disturbances, impaired sleep, and the use of sedatives and analgesics. Patients with advanced age, dementia, chronic illness, extensive vascular disease, and low cardiac output are at particular risk of developing delirium. Specialized bedside assessment tools are now available to rapidly diagnose delirium, even in mechanically ventilated patients. Increased awareness of delirium risk factors, in addition to non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for delirium, can be effective in reducing the incidence of delirium in cardiac patients and in minimizing adverse outcomes, once delirium occurs.",

Systemic speech underdevelopment in alalia is characterized by violations in the phonetic, phonemic, lexical, and grammatical structure. Patients with alalia can also have non-speech related impairments, including motor (impaired movement and coordination), sensory (impaired sensitivity and perception), and psychopathological disorders. There are three types of alalia: motor, sensory, and mixed. Children with motor alalia have expressive language disorders, speech praxis, poor speech fluency, impaired articulation, and other focal neurological symptoms; however, they understand speech directed to them. Patients with motor alalia are often left-handed. Regional slowing and epileptiform activity are often detected on their electroencephalogram. Children with sensory alalia are characterized by poor speech understanding (despite normal hearing) resulting in secondary underdevelopment of their own speech. These patients have problems with the analysis of sounds, including speech sounds (impaired speech gnosis), which prevents the development of association between the sound image and the object. Therefore, the child hears, but does not understand the speech directed at him/her (auditory agnosia). Differential diagnosis of alalia is challenging and may require several months of observation. It also implies the exclusion of hearing loss and mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Relatively little is known about the neurobiology of insomnia, despite its wide prevalence and broad medical impact. Although much is still to be learned about the pathophysiology of the disorder, identification, systematic assessment, and appropriate treatment are clearly beneficial to patients. Recent research, using quantitative EEG, polysomnography (PSG), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and neuroimaging techniques, suggests that some broad areas can be identified as possible pathophysiological models. Sleep-wake homeostat model hypothesizes a failure in homeostatic regulation of sleep, an attenuated increase in sleep drive with time awake, and/or defective sensing of sleep need. Circadian clock model hypothesizes a dysfunctional circadian clock, resulting in changes in the timing of sleep-wake propensity that are incompatible with normal sleep. Intrinsic sleep-wake state mechanism model suggests that abnormal function of insomnia comprises the systems responsible for expression of the sleep states themselves. Extrinsic over-ride mechanism (stress-response) model suggests that insomnia reflects the consequences of overactivity of one of the systems considered extrinsic to normal sleep-wake control. Many current therapies for insomnia are based on these physiological models. Several attempts have been made to create a physiological model that would explain this disorder and could be used as a foundation for treatment. However, it appeared that no model can fully explain and clarify all aspects of insomnia. Future research should be necessary to expand our knowledge on the biological dimensions of insomnia.",

The retinal disorders which may be mis diagnosed as optic neuritis include Leber neuroretinitis, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and Stargardt macular dystrophy. Retinal changes which evolve in neuroretinitis, and the pseudopapilledema in Leber heredity optic neuropathy are helpful in differentiating these disorders from optic neuritis. Stargardt macular dystrophy, a disorder associated with a variety of mutations, may be mis diagnosed as psychogenic visual loss due to the early normal appearance of the retina, and the loss of vision over a period of weeks. The differentiation of optic neuritis from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), depends upon the initial appearance of the optic disc (in AION either hyperemia due to reperfusion, or swelling and pallor if total infarction has occurred). The authors have described children with abrupt loss of vision during renal dialysis, whose risk factors for AION included systemic hypotension and intra ocular hypertension. Children with vigorous treatment of accelerated hypertension, and children with migraine and pro thrombotic disorders have also incurred AION. Thus, AION should be suspected when acute loss of vision occurs in association with certain ocular and systemic risk factors. In children capable of cooperating for visual field examination, the typical change in AION is an altitudinal defect, while optic neuritis it is a central scotoma. The association of optic neuritis with multiple sclerosis, DeVic disease, and with acute demyelinating1 encephalomyelitis require special consideration in regard to treatment and prognosis.

Initial neuropsychiatric manifestations such as depression, delusions and hallucinations are frequently observed and sometimes make it difficult to diagnose the neurocognitive disorder underlying the symptoms, so it is important to perform a proper clinical examination, as the use of certain neuroleptics may worsen neurological symptoms. Objectives This case aims to investigate the psychiatric clinical features of Lewy body dementia from a clinical and therapeutic perspective. Methods A comprehensive search on psychiatric manifestations that may cover up dementia. Results 71-year-old female with depressive symptoms for the last 8 years. She is admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit due to worsening of depressive symptoms despite correct adherence to treatment. Her psychiatric history includes a diagnosis of specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depressive episodes with inhibitory symptomatology. During her stay at the hospital, the patient is inhibited, perplexed and experiences feelings of embarrassment and guilt, along with persistent insomnia and poor response to different lines of treatment. Initially, there is notable intolerance to antipsychotics, resulting in worsening of motor and cognitive functions, as well as hypotension, using risperidone and olanzapine. After the withdrawal of treatment, the patient begins to exhibit delusional ideas and visual hallucinations, leading us to consider that she may be suffering from depression associated with an undiagnosed organic brain pathology. Clinical tests (MoCA,MMSE) reveals cognitive symptoms which, along with the motor symptoms, suggests a Parkinson’s-dementia complex. A PET-CT scan with fluorodeoxyglucose-F18 reveals severe hypometabolism in the left parietotemporal and prefrontal regions. These findings are consistent with LBD. Treatment is initiated with rivastigmine and quetiapine. However, due to the presence of hypotension, quetiapine is replaced with clozapine 25 mg, resulting in a slight improvement in rest and affective responses to the psychotic symptoms. Conclusions This case illustrates how depression and psychotic symptoms can serve as early indicators of dementia, stemming from the loss of dopaminergic and acetylcholinergic pathways as part of the neurodegenerative process. These patients may present with a range of cognitive, neuropsychiatric, sleep, motor, and autonomic symptoms. Depression is prevalent in approximately 28% of these patients. Currently, clinicians diagnose LBD based on the presence of core clinical features and indicative biomarkers. Treatment can be complicated by patients’ sensitivity to certain medications, needing careful evaluation of potential side effects. Current guidelines recommend the use of antipsychotics such as quetiapine or clozapine at low doses, as these have a reduced risk of extrapyramidal effects. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (BMEI) is an idiopathic disorder characterized by spontaneous myoclonic attacks with onset in the first 2 years of life. We observed 6 neurologically normal infants (aged 6-21 months) with attacks that resembled those of BMEI but that occurred as reflex responses to unexpected auditory and tactile stimuli. four infants also had rare spontaneous attacks. These reflex attacks consisted of isolated muscle jerks or clusters of up to eight symmetric limb jerks affecting mainly the arms. Five of the children had a family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions. Myoclonic attacks disappeared in 4-14 months. In 3 patients, the jerks stopped spontaneously; the others responded to valproate (VPA). Myoclonus could be elicited in wakefulness and in sleep. Ictal EEGs showed brief generalized spike- or polyspike-and-wave discharges. Interictal EEGs were normal during wakefulness; during sleep, brief generalized discharges were evident. We propose that reflex myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (RMEI) is a new age-dependent idiopathic generalized epileptic (IGE) syndrome, with an apparently good prognosis.",

Llegando a negativa para ingerir alimentos y permanencia en posición fija de sedestación, como elementos clave para la sospecha clínica y el diagnóstico oportuno. Descripción del caso: Masculino de 57 años, con historia de síntomas afectivos, quien ingreso a urgencias diagnosticado con episodio depresivo mayor de características catatónicas, el cual mejoró con el inicio de midazolam y luego titulación de Lorazepam. Pasadas cinco semanas de estancia hospitalaria fue dado de alta con antidepresivos y dosis estándar de benzodiazepinas, las cuales se retiraron ambulatoriamente, sin recurrencia de los síntomas durante un año de seguimiento. Conclusiones: Un episodio catatónico puede ser causado por trastornos afectivos. La catatonía secundaria a trastornos afectivos es rara en la práctica clínica, lo cual causa que pase inadvertida, por lo cual el conocimiento de esta alteración genera un manejo oportuno de pacientes reduciendo el gasto de los recursos del sistema de salud y mejorando la calidad de vida de la persona.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Developmental delay can be associated with epilepsy. Epilepsy might be either the cause of the delay of acquisitions (epileptogenic encephalopathy) or only one additional manifestation, the consequence of the underlying neurological pathology (encephalopathy with epilepsy); it is therefore not the only factor responsible for delay. Within the framework of encephalopathies with epilepsy a rigorous diagnosis is necessary with, in particular a cutaneous examination (neuro‐cutaneous syndromes), a precise clinical examination (anoxo‐ischaemic sequelae of the perinatal period), an EEG, a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as the search for associated abnomalities (cardiac, renal…). There are also epileptogenic encephalopathies such as age‐related syndromes: Hemiconvulsions‐Hemiplegia‐Epilepsy syndrome; Rasmussen's syndrome; Dravet's syndrome; myoclono‐astatic epilepsy (Doose). Age at onset and type of seizures, as well as ictal and interictal EEG finding provide valuable hints for a specific diagnosis, while other investigation are usually not contributive. Developmental delay and epilepsy are frequently associated. One of the first steps to diagnosis consists in trying to establish the eventual causal role of the epilepsy. Answering this question may prove to be of primary importance for the choice of a therapeutic strategy and/or further etiological investigations.",

      "abstract": "Seizures, a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms resulting from abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain [1, 2].Seizure is one of the commonest neurological illnesses. About 4-10% of children experience at least one episode in the rst 16 years of life. Where 1/5th of total children with unprovoked seizures may develop epilepsy. Risk is approximately 20% if neurological examination, electroencephalogram (EEG) and neuroimaging is normal[1]. EEG abnormalities can be detected in up to 59% of children with rst afebrile seizure and can identify subtle focality in presence of normal magnetic resonance imaging of brain[1]. Neuroimaging has an important role in children with focal seizure, persistent seizure activity, focal neurologic decit, neurocutaneous disorder etc.Right assessment and scrutiny of rst seizure is crucial, not only for abortion of acute attack but also for long term control of epilepsy. Aim and methods- The objective of the study is to determine the age of onset, etiology of rst episode of seizure in children between the age group of above 5 yearsto15 years and the pattern of EEG changes and MRI ndings in the above group of children. In a prospective single centre observational study at GIMS GADAG, around 60 children who were admitted with rst episode of seizure at age group of above 5 years to 15 years to our emergency department between October 2021 to July-2022 (10 months) were studied. Seizures dened using international league against epilepsy (ILAE). EEG and MRI were done in all 60 children and their records were analysed. Results- A total of 60 children presenting with rst episode of seizures were included in the study. 9-12 year age group were major portion of our study with male gender predominance. Generalized seizures were more common accounting for 78%. Idiopathic seizure was the most common etiology identied (40%), followed by meningitis (27%) and other causes. EEG abnormality was seen in 50% of the children.",

      "abstract": "A group of insomniacs whose only sleep-stage abnormality was prolonged sleep latency was identified. Prior to sleep onset, these subjects had significantly higher levels of physiological activity than did normal sleepers. With the approach of sleep onset, these differences diminished. No group differences in presleep cognitive activity were found. Insomniacs had significantly higher Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores than normal on scales indicating neuroticism, anxiety, and worry (derived from the Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales). Although sleep-onset insomnia is accompanied by psychological disturbance and heightened physiological activity, it is unlikely that either factor alone is sufficient to cause it. Excessive rumination may be an epiphenomenon of sleeplessness. Chronic insomnia is a distressing complaint that affects millions of persons (Solomon, 1979). Three general types of insomnia have been described: initial, or sleep-onset; intermittent, or sleep-maintenance; and terminal, or early morning awakening (Kleitman, 1963). The present investigation is concerned with primary idiopathic sleep-onset insomnia: the inability to fall asleep in the absence of identifiable physiological or psychological determinants. Many theories have been advanced to explain idiopathic insomnia (Rechtschaffen & Monroe, 1969). Two of the most popular suggest that insomniacs are either physiologically or cognitively hyperaroused relative to normal (Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, 1979; Borkovec, 1979). Support for the first hypothesis has rested largely on a study by Monroe (1967), demonstrating that self-defined poor sleepers had higher levels of physiological activity than good",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias comprise the behavioral, experiential, and autonomic nervous system disorders surrounding rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep and can cause injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Parasomnias often involve the abnormal release of instinctual drives, such as locomotion, aggression, feeding, and sex during sleep, and can manifest with dream-enacting behaviors. Parasomnias are relevant to psychiatrists in regards to their misdiagnosis as a psychiatric disorder; their nocturnal extension of a daytime psychiatric disorder; their stress-responsivity; their induction or aggravation by psychotropic drugs; their adverse psychologic con- sequences; their link to various neurologic and medical disorders; and their forensic implications. Parasomnias can be categorized as primary disorders of sleep, or as secondary organ system disorders emerging during the sleep period. The evaluation of parasomnias includes clinical interviews, review of medical records, screening psy- chologic tests, neurologic examination, and hospital-based polysomnographic moni- toring. This article discusses the six most prominent behavioral parasomnias: REM sleep behavior disorder, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals (including abnormal sleep related sexual behaviors and severe morning sleep inertia), sleep relat- ed eating disorder, and sleep related dissociative disorders. Parasomnias can appear at any time in the human life cycle, often demonstrate prominent gender discordances, and can usually be accurately diagnosed and effectively treated.",

Celiac disease is found in patients with a percentage ranging from 1.9% to 16.7%. Gluten cerebellar ataxia is purely cerebellar and involves the entire cerebellum. The clinical signs of CA are gait ataxia, limb ataxia, dysarthria, pyramidal signs, altered eyes motions, and progressive impairment of stability, and erect position. The patients affected by Gluten CA show an immunological response against a primarily brain expressed TG, such as TG6. The prolonged gluten consumption in patients with gluten ataxia leads to a progressive loss of purkinje cells in the cerebellum. An early diagnosis of CA and gluten related disorders (GRD) increases the possibility to improve the neurological process. Non celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is defined by clinical evidence of improvement of symptoms following the introduction of GFD in the absence of enteropathy. The increased recognition of the whole spectrum of Gluten related disorders (GRD) is the best way to improve the time of the diagnosis and to avoid patients with neurological manifestation remaining untreated if duodenal biopsy does not reveal an enteropathy. Cerebellar Ataxia is equally responsive to GFD in CD and NCGS patients.",

      "title": "Postoperative Delirium",
      "abstract": "NETWORKS are central to life, a fact that becomes strikingly apparent when they become dysfunctional. We have all experienced a sense of frustration when the “net is down” or when trapped in an airport because some critical hub in another city has been debilitated by an unexpected snowstorm. Even seemingly minor disruptions in the transfer of information or people can lead to a surprising degree of disorganization. However, these relatively inconsequential annoyances of modern life pale in comparison with faltering or failing brain networks. Aberrant structural and/or functional connections across the brain account for numerous neurological conditions (such as apraxia or agraphia)1 and have been hypothesized to mediate more complex cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia.2 So why should a clinical anesthesiologist care about a neurologic or psychiatric “disconnection syndrome?” The answer is found in this issue of Anesthesiology, where van Dellen et al.3 present evidence to suggest that postoperative delirium is associated with abnormal patterns of functional and directional connectivity in the brain.Delirium is an acute cognitive disorder, which is typically characterized by a fluctuating course, inattention, disordered thinking, and altered level of consciousness.4 With a reported incidence between 5 and 70% in patients older than 65 yr after various major surgeries,5,6 delirium is arguably the most common neurologic complication of major surgery. Despite this, the pathophysiology of delirium is poorly understood.7 Importantly, postoperative delirium is associated with increased morbidity, longer hospital or intensive care unit stay, cognitive decline, quality-of-life decrement, and death.5,8–10 Patients with delirium can be hyperactive and agitated or hypoactive and lethargic. Interestingly, the hypoactive motor subtype is more common, is often undiagnosed, and has been associated with worse outcomes.11 In short, delirium is a pathophysiologically obscure, underdiagnosed, common, and serious neurological complication of surgery. The field of anesthesiology should therefore prioritize its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, while concurrently investigating its underlying mechanisms.In the current study, van Dellen et al. conducted a postoperative assessment of patients aged 50 yr or older undergoing cardiac surgery who had no history of neurologic or psychiatric disease. Mental status was evaluated during a 5-day period after surgery (or after emerging from postoperative coma) using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit, a validated instrument for diagnosing delirium in intubated intensive care unit patients.12 In addition, 21-channel electroencephalography was recorded in the postoperative period and later analyzed for functional connectivity, directional connectivity, and various network features (table 1). Clinical characteristics and connectivity and network measures were compared between patients with delirium and a matched cohort without delirium. The investigators found that, not surprisingly, patients with delirium (n = 25) were sicker and had longer surgical times compared with patients without delirium (n = 24). However, even controlling for these factors, there was a reduction of functional connectivity in the α bandwidth (8 to 13 Hz) and increased directional connectivity from central to anterior regions in the δ bandwidth (0.5 to 4 Hz). Furthermore, a number of network properties (such as path length and clustering coefficient) were abnormal in patients who experienced delirium. The authors concluded that functional brain networks are less connected in association with postoperative delirium, suggesting that mechanistically it may be classified as a disconnection syndrome.Before interpreting these results, it will be beneficial to consider some methodological points. There are four types of “connectivity” that are often measured in the brain: (1) structural, defined as the anatomic connections between brain regions, (2) functional, defined as the statistical covariations between the activity of brain regions, (3) directional, defined as coupled activity in which one brain region leads and another follows or lags (without, necessarily, having a causal influence), and (4) effective, defined as a causal relationship in which one brain region is influencing the activity of another. One well-known problem with measures of functional connectivity using electroencephalography is volume conduction. If the same source of activity is detected at two different electrodes, that activity artificially appears to be synchronized or coherent because it is merely common to both electrodes. To avoid this problem, Stam13 (an author of the current study) and colleagues previously introduced phase lag index (PLI) as a measure of functional connectivity. PLI attempts to bypass the volume conduction problem by not “counting” zero-lag correlations (which, because there is no phase difference, could potentially come from the same source). Instead, PLI assesses consistent, nonzero phase lead–lag relationships that presumably reflect a functional connection between two sources of activity. Unlike this snapshot measure of instantaneous phase relationship, directed PLI (dPLI) is a measure of directional connectivity that assesses lead–lag relationships over time. dPLI has been studied in a neuroanatomically informed brain model and shows a tendency of α rhythm “flow” from anterior to posterior brain structures in the resting state,14 which has been confirmed empirically in human volunteers.15van Dellen et al. used PLI and dPLI in the current study. This means that their results regarding functional connectivity might be less likely to reflect volume conduction and also means that the findings may reflect longer-range connections in the brain (which would tend to have nonzero lag relationships). Of note, Lee et al. previously studied PLI and dPLI after induction with propofol, finding reduced PLI in the α bandwidth (8 to 13 Hz) during and after the period of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Furthermore, the abnormal dPLI may reflect changes in the topology of the network, as has also been suggested by the study of dPLI and propofol (although in the α rather than δ bandwidth).15 In light of the current findings, it might be speculated that postoperative delirium reflects a failed recovery—or perhaps a fragile recovery—of functional connectivity, as manifested in the α bandwidth. This functional “disconnection” could prevent individual subsystems in the brain from properly interacting and integrating information, resulting in the cognitive deficits characteristic of delirium. Furthermore, electroencephalographic measures of connectivity may have diagnostic potential, especially in the case of hypoactive delirium when the phenotype is not clinically obvious.There are a number of important points to consider before including postoperative delirium in the class of disconnection syndromes. First, a prior study of functional magnetic resonance imaging and delirium demonstrated an increase in functional connectivity between prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, with decreases between cortical and subcortical structures.16 These data need to be reconciled with the electroencephalographic study by van Dellen et al., who found reduced corticocortical connectivity. Second, the differences in functional connectivity between the cohorts with and without delirium were small (PLI of 0.119 vs. 0.139). It is unclear what clinical meaning these statistically significant differences have in relation to overall network function, or whether they could be explained by more mundane reasons related to the processing of the electroencephalographic data. Third, unlike the past study of functional magnetic resonance imaging, this was not a within-subjects study design. In other words, we do not have data on individual subjects in periods of both lucidity and cognitive dysfunction and therefore cannot distinguish if the changes in functional connectivity are associated with delirium or some other brain property of these generally sicker patients. Finally, delirium has a complex etiology, so any potential relationship between the cognitive disconnections during anesthetic-induced unconsciousness15,17 and those of the postoperative period is merely speculative.Despite these limitations, it should be noted that the work by van Dellen et al. is the first to probe the electroencephalogram of patients with postoperative delirium beyond its spectral properties, pointing to the potential for functional disconnections and network abnormalities as the mechanism for disrupted cognition. Further work is required to reconcile these results with past investigations using functional magnetic resonance imaging and to establish robust connectivity measures that might reveal when the network is down.The authors are not supported by, nor maintain any financial interest in, any commercial activity that may be associated with the topic of this article.",

      "abstract": "Seizure is one of the most common neurologic conditions in children, occurring most often in the first year of life. Identification of provoking factors, such as fever, illness, head trauma, electrolyte disturbance, or central nervous system infection, is important for determining prognosis and likelihood of recurrence. In patients presenting with a suspected first seizure, a history should be taken and a neurologic examination performed to determine whether the event was a seizure. If seizure is confirmed, it should be determined whether it was a first seizure and was provoked or unprovoked. The final step is to determine the cause. For children who present with simple febrile seizures, no additional evaluation typically is needed. An electroencephalogram performed during wakefulness and sleep is recommended for children with a first unprovoked seizure. For children with new-onset seizures, particularly focal seizures or status epilepticus, neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging study is recommended. Most children will have only a single seizure, whereas a small number will develop epilepsy. Risk factors for epilepsy development include a history of febrile seizures, status epilepticus, a family history of epilepsy, developmental delay, and abnormal neurologic examination results.",

      "abstract": "Autism is one of the behaviorally defined developmental disorders of brain function. It has a variety of genetic and nongenetic etiologies, with etiology being unknown in the majority of children. Boys are more frequently affected than girls. Manifest in the preschool years, autism always affects sociability, communication, and the child's repertoire of activities and interests. Autism encompasses children with a broad range of severities and a variety of other signs of brain dysfunction. These include motor signs, notably stereotypies; abnormal responses to a variety of sensory stimuli; and disorders of affect and attention. A significant proportion of autistic children experience epileptic seizures and have abnormal EEGs. Neuroimaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging, discloses abnormalities of brain development in a minority of autistic persons. The level of intelligence may range from profound mental deficiency to giftedness. The pattern of cognitive skills is likely to be uneven, typically with better nonverbal than verbal skills. In the preschool years, all autistic children have a developmental language disorder. Verbal expression may range from total lack of language to verbosity with echolalia; comprehension and language use are invariably impaired. While there is no specific pharmacologic agent to mitigate the fundamental disorder, children may benefit from drugs to treat specific symptoms such as attention disorder and seizures. Although autistic behaviors are the consequence of a static disorder of brain function, their character changes with maturation and appropriate intervention. Communication skills and sociability remain deficient but improve in all but the most severely affected children. Outcome is a function of both innate cognitive competence and the effectiveness of early intervention focused on the development of appropriate social skills and meaningful communication. Intelligent autistic adults may be educable, employable, and able to live independently, while more severely handicapped ones require a lifelong protected environment.",

      "title": "Action myoclonus, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and other cerebellar myoclonic syndromes.",
      "abstract": "Action myoclonus, reviewed in this chapter, is the term applied to arrhythmic muscular jerking induced by voluntary movement. It is made worse by attempts at precise or coordinated movement (intention myoclonus) and may also be provoked by certain sensory stimuli. The effective stimuli for action myoclonus is probably feedback from muscle afferents, although it may be initiated by corollary discharge from motor cortex to reticular formation before or at the onset of voluntary movement. The condition is usually associated with diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, uremia, and the various forms of PME, although action myoclonus may be limited to one limb in some cases of focal cerebral damage. It is caused by hyperexcitability of the sensorimotor cortex (cortical reflex myoclonus) or reticular formation (reticular reflex myoclonus), or both. No consistent pathological change has been reported in autopsied cases of action myoclonus. The underlying disorder appears to be a loss of inhibitory mechanisms involving serotonin and possibly GABA as transmitter agents. The term PME is used for the association of myoclonus with degenerative changes in the nervous system which are commonly diffuse but may predominate in certain systems. There may or may not be associated tonic-clonic seizures, other manifestations of epilepsy, or dementia. Those cases of PME associated with Lafora inclusion bodies and cerebral storage diseases can be distinguished from the system degenerations. Systems which may be involved in the latter group include cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar pathways, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers. Confronted with this diversity of pathological change, it seems unnecessary to make any clinical distinction between Ramsay Hunt syndrome and Unverricht-Lundborg syndrome (Baltic myoclonus) because cerebellar signs are found in patients described under both headings. Additional systems may be involved in individuals or families who are otherwise typical. All three names could well be joined in an eponymous title (Unverricht-Lundborg-Hunt disease) or the condition simply known as the systems degeneration type of PME, as Halliday (43) suggested. The cause of the condition (or spectrum of conditions) is at present unknown. Action myoclonus usually responds to sodium valproate or clonazepam, and some individuals, particularly those with posthypoxic myoclonus, improve with the administration of serotonin precursors.",

      "abstract": "Lyme disease is a multisystemic illness that can affect the central nervous system (CNS), causing neurologic and psychiatric symptoms. The goal of this article is to familiarize psychiatrists with this spirochetal illness.Relevant books, articles, and abstracts from academic conferences were perused, and additional articles were located through computerized searches and reference sections from published articles.Up to 40% of patients with Lyme disease develop neurologic involvement of either the peripheral or central nervous system. Dissemination to the CNS can occur within the first few weeks after skin infection. Like syphilis, Lyme disease may have a latency period of months to years before symptoms of late infection emerge. Early signs include meningitis, encephalitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculoneuropathies. Later, encephalomyelitis and encephalopathy may occur. A broad range of psychiatric reactions have been associated with Lyme disease including paranoia, dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, panic attacks, major depression, anorexia nervosa, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Depressive states among patients with late Lyme disease are fairly common, ranging across studies from 26% to 66%. The microbiology of Borrelia burgdorferi sheds light on why Lyme disease can be relapsing and remitting and why it can be refractory to normal immune surveillance and standard antibiotic regimens.Psychiatrists who work in endemic areas need to include Lyme disease in the differential diagnosis of any atypical psychiatric disorder. Further research is needed to identify better laboratory tests and to determine the appropriate manner (intravenous or oral) and length (weeks or months) of treatment among patients with neuropsychiatric involvement.",

      "title": "Neurodegenerative diseases and sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The interest in sleep disorders associated with neurodegenerative diseases is growing. Indeed, they add up to the clinical features of each of these conditions and may bring insight into their mechanisms. Along this line one of the major findings in recent years has been that REM-sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) has a predilection for synucleinopathies including idiopathic Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies, though not for tauopathies. We have reviewed neurodegenerative diseases without dementia (with the exception of idiopathic Parkinson's disease reviewed in another article of the same issue) and neurodegenerative diseases with dementia, in considering clinical features, pathologic patterns, associated sleep disorders and their treatments. Multiple system atrophy is characterised by rather severe breathing abnormalities, including obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome, dysrhythmic breathing and laryngeal stridor, and by REM-sleep behaviour disorder which may precede the onset of clinical features of multiple system atrophy by several years. Insomnia is the most common sleep-related symptom of progressive supranuclear palsy. It is generally more severe than in other neurodegenerative diseases. Polysomnography shows the progressive shortening of sleep. Rapid eye movements of REM sleep are abnormal. Sleep disorders have not been systematically investigated in corticobasal degeneration. The most efficient therapeutic approaches of these conditions include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the case of sleep breathing abnormalities and clonazepam for REM-sleep behaviour disorder. Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease with dementia. Sleep is both reduced and disorganised. Sleep-related breathing disorders are common. Special features of Alzheimer's disease are sundowning''. an agitation behaviour occurring during the early evening and episodic nocturnal wandering. In frontotemporal dementia sleep disorders are comparable to those of other dementias with aspecific impairment of sleep continuity and architecture. In comparison with other dementias, dementia with Lewy bodies leads to more severe sleep disturbances, including more movement disorders whilst asleep, more excessive daytime sleepiness and REM-sleep behaviour disorder characteristic of a synucleinopathy. Current treatments fall into four categories: identifying and treating any medical factor of impaired sleep, using sedative medications as parcimoniously as possible, environmental and circadian manipulations.",

      "title": "SUPPLEMENTARY ADMINISTRATION OF ARTIFICIAL BRIGHT LIGHT AND MELATONIN AS POTENT TREATMENT FOR DISORGANIZED CIRCADIAN REST-ACTIVITY AND DYSFUNCTIONAL AUTONOMIC AND NEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEMS IN INSTITUTIONALIZED DEMENTED ELDERLY PERSONS",
      "abstract": "Increased daytime napping, early morning awakening, frequent nocturnal sleep interruptions, and lowered amplitude and phase advance of the circadian sleep-wake rhythm are characteristic features of sleep-waking and chronobiological changes associated with aging. Especially in elderly patients with dementia, severely fragmented sleep-waking patterns are observed frequently and are associated with disorganized circadian rhythm of various physiological functions. Functional and/or organic deterioration of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), decreased exposure to time cues such as insufficient social interaction and reduced environmental light, lowered sensitivity of sensory organs to time cues, and reduced ability of peripheral effector organs to express circadian rhythms may cause these chronobiological changes. In many cases of dementia, the usual treatments for insomnia do not work well, and the development of an effective therapy is an important concern for health care practitioner and researchers. Recent therapeutical trials of supplementary administration of artificial bright light and the pineal hormone melatonin, a potent synchronizer for mammalian circadian rhythm, have indicated that these treatments are useful tools for demented elderly insomniacs. Both bright light and melatonin simultaneously ameliorate disorganized thermoregulatory and neuroendocrine systems associated with disrupted sleep-waking times, suggesting a new, potent therapeutic means for insomnia in the demented elderly. Future studies should address the most effective therapeutic design and the most suitable types of symptoms for treatment and investigate the use of these tools in preventive applications in persons in early stages of dementia.

      "abstract": "The so-called hidden symptoms or soft signs of multiple sclerosis comprise cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, depression and anxiety. From a patient's perspective, these symptoms are rated as exerting much more negative impact on quality of life and daily functioning than their physical symptoms. Despite this knowledge, the symptoms remain disregarded by many neurologists in clinical practice. This missing awareness can be attributed to several reasons. First, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms determining occurrence and severity of the different symptoms are still unclear. Second, there is uncertainty in how to reliably assess them. It is undeniable that assessment can be difficult as the hidden symptoms seldom appear isolated but more often highly interact. Third, if standardized, fast and cost-effective assessment to quantify and monitor the evolution of the hidden symptoms would be feasible, the question still remains how to treat these aspects. The present article will give an overview on symptom background and assessment strategies for clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Many areas of neurodivergence are associated with heightened sensitivity, discomfort, and aversion to certain visual stimuli (e.g., bright lights, patterns, movement, flicker, complex scenes). This hypersensitivity also associates with mental health and some areas of neurology. However, it remains unclear whether this is a transdiagnostic phenomenon, implying a common underlying mechanism of shared vulnerability, or whether the forms of visual discomfort differ instructively across the wide range of associated conditions and areas of neurodivergence. We compared the four recently clarified subtypes of visual hypersensitivity (Brightness, Pattern, Strobing, Intense Visual Environments) self-reported by 2582 participants across 11 areas of neurodivergence, neurology, and mental health: Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Fibromyalgia, Migraine, PPPD, synaesthesia, Distress, Eating Pathology, and Fear (HiTOP System). Enhanced sensitivity in all four factors was reported for every area. Sensitivity to Intense Visual Environments was especially pronounced across Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, and Dyspraxia, forming a shared pattern. The same pattern was shared with fibromyalgia and PPPD, and to some extent with Eating Pathology and Fear, while migraine and synaesthesia showed a different pattern. Regression analyses controlling for comorbidities showed significant unique prediction by 9 out of 11 neurodivergence/condition labels, the strongest predictors being autism, fibromyalgia, migraine, and PPPD. In conclusion, the four factors of visual hypersensitivity are all transdiagnostic, and the relative emphasis on each factor also forms transdiagnostic patterns that transcend traditional discipline boundaries. This implies there are common underlying vulnerabilities in the development of perceptual systems that can be associated with a wide range of other symptomologies.",

Objective: Review major neurological afflictions in astronauts. Methods: Research into bibliographic reviews at PubMed, using the descriptors “astronauts” and “neurological disorders” Results: Several neurological alterations, such as ataxy, intracranial hypertension (ICH), neuromuscular disorders, ocular disturbances and changes in cognitive functions were assigned to a microgravity environment. Astronauts returning from space presented ICH; being the main pathophysiology hypothesis referred to a change in the liquor dynamics as a result of venous drainage obstruction and hematoencephalic barrier. Also, gravity doesn’t act on the neurovestibular system during space flights. This phenomenon can lead to Space Motion Sickness, situation in which astronauts report balance, coordination and sight disturbances, as well as movement illusions. A subset of this syndrome, called Space Movement Disorder, may occur; which includes symptoms, such as flushing, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and malaise. Based on electromagnetic resonance, the occurrence of problems with movement time, balance, spatial working memory and motor coordination after the return of the space crew suggests alterations in cerebellum’s function and structure, which is responsible for the coordination and the fine motor control. Conclusion: Most studies presented disruptions of the neurofunctional homeostasis, for instance, changes in functional connectivity while in rest and alterations of the white and grey matter in sensor motor, somatosensory and cognitive regions of the brain.",

In extremely stressful situation the cognitive functions of the depressive individuals may impaired to such an extent that they may have the feeling of entrapment for which they may take the way of suicidal acts for escape. A number of brain regions that are involved in higher cognitive functions are altered in depression patients, suicidal individuals and in complete suicides. Along with the morphological changes, monoaminergic neurotransmission system is also severely deteriorated in these brain regions indicating their possible involvements in regulating cognitive activities. Monoaminergic dysfunctions may give rise to serious cognitive impairments and deterioration of associated mental functions required for maintaining normal internal homeostasis. Loss of cognitive functions makes an individual incapable to interact properly to various aspects of normal life functions making them depressive and severe depression may be the forerunner of suicidal acts.",

There is evidence of significant genetic etiology involving multiple genes such as dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (DTNBP1) and neuregulin 1 (NRG1). There is no clear link between neurotransmitter changes and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia; however, studies have shown that subcortical dopamine dysfunction is the key mechanism. Specific regions of gray and white matter changes are observed in patients with schizophrenia; gray matter changes being more significant after the onset of psychosis. These pathological changes may be implicated in the impairment of executive functioning, attention, and working memory. The disease can be managed with pharmacological treatments based on individual patient profile, patient compliance, and disease severity. The challenge of disease management sometimes persists due to the side effects.

Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

Schilder's disease, also known as encephalitis periaxialis, or progressive degenerative subcortical encephalopathy, is one of the demyelinating diseases affecting the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. It is characterized by spastic paralysis, mental deterioration, blindness, deafness, and eventually death. It is most often seen in infants and young children. The course may be acute, subacute, or chronic. The development of the signs mentioned above depends on which area of the brain is affected. In children epileptiform seizures are also seen. Blindness usually occurs late in the disease and a majority of the patients go on to partial or complete blindness. Optic nerve",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome is a common neurological disorder with an estimated prevalence between 2 and 10%. It is characterised by an imperative desire to move the extremities associated with paraesthesias, motor restlessness, worsening of symptoms at rest with at least partial relief by activity, and worsening of symptoms in the evening or at night. As a consequence, patients suffer from severe sleep disturbances and, less frequently, from daytime sleepiness. The cause of restless legs syndrome remains unknown. It has been divided into idiopathic and symptomatic (secondary, e.g. uraemic restless legs syndrome) forms. Based on pharmacological, neurophysiological and imaging studies it is suggested that it is a disease of the subcortical central nervous system with involvement of the brainstem and spinal chord. Dopaminergic agents are regarded as the first choice of treatment; however, the development of augmentation of symptoms especially under levodopa therapy may be a major problem. Alternative medications are opioids and benzodiazepines. In secondary restless legs syndrome the underlying illness should be treated first, but dopaminergic drugs may also be helpful.",

Breast-fed children wake more. The point at which night-waking becomes a problem may be to some extent dependent on parental attitude and tolerance. Parasomnias Parasomnias are defined as an intrusion into sleep without a reduction in sleep length. In the preschool age group these will usually be night terrors or variants of somnambulism (sleepwalking). The main differential diagnosis of parasomnias are the nocturnal epilepsies, which may require video electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment if suspected. Night terrors The child will appear afraid, inconsolable, and often moaning or whimpering repetitively. They will usually be either unresponsive or only partially responsive to attempts to intervene or communicate. Characteristically, the child will remember nothing of the event in the morning. Night terrors usually occur in the first few hours after going to bed [a non-rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnia]",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disease manifesting as difficulty with maintaining continuous wake and sleep. Clinical presentation varies but requires excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) occurring alone or together with features of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep dissociation (e.g., cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis), and disrupted nighttime sleep. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is associated with reductions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin due to destruction of hypocretin peptide-producing neurons in the hypothalamus in individuals with a specific genetic predisposition. Updated diagnostic criteria include the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Sleep Disorders Third Edition (ICSD-3). DSM-5 criteria require EDS in association with any one of the following: (1) cataplexy; (2) CSF hypocretin deficiency; (3) REM sleep latency ≤15 minutes on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG); or (4) mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) with ≥2 sleep-onset REM-sleep periods (SOREMPs). ICSD-3 relies more upon objective data in addition to EDS, somewhat complicating the diagnostic criteria: 1) cataplexy and either positive MSLT/PSG findings or CSF hypocretin deficiency; (2) MSLT criteria similar to DSM-5 except that a SOREMP on PSG may count as one of the SOREMPs required on MSLT; and (3) distinct division of narcolepsy into type 1, which requires the presence of cataplexy or documented CSF hypocretin deficiency, and type 2, where cataplexy is absent, and CSF hypocretin levels are either normal or undocumented. We discuss limitations of these criteria such as variability in clinical presentation of cataplexy, particularly when cataplexy may be ambiguous, as well as by age; multiple and/or invasive CSF diagnostic test requirements; and lack of normative diagnostic test data (e.g., MSLT) in certain populations. While ICSD-3 criteria reflect narcolepsy pathophysiology, DSM-5 criteria have greater clinical practicality, suggesting that valid and reliable biomarkers to help standardize narcolepsy diagnosis would be welcomed.",

It also tends to cause more rapid deterioration of a person’s abilities than Alzheimer’s disease or most other types of dementia. The disease is caused by prions which are defective proteins in the brain tissue.Initially, patients experience problem with muscular coordination; personality changes, including impaired memory, judgment, and thinking; and impaired vision. As the illness progresses, the patient’s mental impairment becomes severe. They often develop involuntary muscle jerks called myoclonus, and they may go blind. They eventually lose the ability to move and speak and enter a coma. Pneumonia and other infections often occur in these patients and can lead to death. Some symptoms of CJD can be similar to symptoms of other progressive neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s or Huntington’s disease. However, CJD causes unique changes in brain tissue which can be seen at autopsy. There is typical spongiform appearance of brain tissue. Electroencephalography, CSF studies and MRI scan confirms the diagnosis. Many drugs including antibiotics are found to be useless for treatment except quinacrine which has shown some promising results.",

Criteria for CNS involvement included evidence of organic brain syndrome, electroencephalographic abnormalities with symptoms referable to CNS, or objective neurologic signs. Sixteen of 37 children had CNS involvement (43%). Thirteen patients had CNS involvement at the onset of SLE. Three patients had late onset CNS manifestations 1 to 2 years after the diagnosis of SLE. The most frequently observed symptoms were headache, behavior disorder, lethargy, diplopia, blurred vision, memory alteration, dizziness, and alteration of consciousness. The most frequently observed neurologic signs were seizures, cranial nerve palsy, ataxia, papilledema, nystagmus, meningitis, tremor, rigidity, cortical blindness, and coma. Neuropsychiatric manifestations included organic brain syndrome, functional psychosis, and personality disorder. Laboratory tests showed elevated cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure and protein, negative cultures, and abnormal electroencephalograms and computerized axial tomography scans. Fourteen of 16 children with CNS manifestations are alive. Thirteen had a mean IQ of 89 by the Wechsler Intelligence Tests. Twelve are in educational programs. One required long‐term psychiatric care. A residual neurologic abnormality, a seizure disorder, was present in 3. CNS involvement with SLE in children carries a favorable prognosis.",

      "title": "Motorists Vestibular Disorientation Syndrome Revisited",
      "abstract": "We present a framework within which to understand the causes of chronic susceptibility to disorientation and how it may be resolved. Motorists Disorientation Syndrome is given as an example disorientation syndrome which may occur without sensory or marked psychological disorder and resembles pilots’ disorientation. The syndrome may begin with an episode of disorientation or a sensory impairment and thereafter can cause dysfunctional behaviour. A neglected feature of disorientation is that contextual stimuli such as differential movements of parts of the visual field may support alternative interpretations affecting orientation. These are not necessarily at a conscious level but are still able to induce apprehension or inappropriate behaviour: a susceptibility to subliminal percepts. Once sensitised to the intrinsic ambiguities of a complex environment it becomes difficult to adjust gains and asymmetries or re-establish rules of reference between somaesthetic and vestibular signals. A fundamental problem in establishing rules for interpreting sensory input is circularity of reference between somatic and visual signals and vestibular signals of motion in space. Somatic and visual signals which give relativistic information about motion are referenced to vestibular signals of absolute motion in space for interpretation. Conversely vestibular signals are calibrated by reference to these other sensory input. Should a problem of interpretation arise in this potentially vicious circle the only recourse is to make an exploratory appraisal of the environment in which the natural first choice for perceptual sampling of world events is vision because of it teleceptive and panoramic power. Unfortunately, this tactic creates ‘visual dependency’ which, in a complex environment, risks creating increased susceptibility to vection illusions and visual vertigo (correspondingly, clinical experience indicates that the longer symptoms remain untreated the more patients suffer visual vertigo). Resolution of this deterioration is by recourse to cognitive behavioural therapy and desensitisation, commencing with dealing with simple stable environments and progressing through levels of increasing instability and ambiguity.",

This exposes an inherent flaw in our nosological system, which requires a manic or hypomanic episode for diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

When there are evidences of associated functional disturbances in other organ systems or in the patient as a whole, or characteristic clinical syndromes are present, and there is lack of symptomatic or objective evidence of organic disease on careful examination, the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely. Treatment of functional gastrointestinal disturbances rests fundamentally on the art of medicine in the treatment of the patient and not on the science of medicine in the treatment of a disease. The essential steps in successful treatment include convincing the patient of the diagnosis, improving and relieving symptoms and avoiding or adequately controlling recurrences.Psychotherapy is a keystone in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders.

These episodes of ballism developed over hours, remained for weeks, and ultimately returned to baseline.

Potential for self-injury or rhabdomyolysis/myoglobinuria led to the use of general anesthetics or neuromuscular blocking agents during selected episodes.

      "abstract": "Dementia is characterized by cognitive impairment and difficulties in executive functioning. It is an umbrella term for different subtypes that should be differentiated using a meticulous review of the patient’s history, physical exam, and work-up. Posing difficulties in diagnosis, findings at times may be inconclusive. We report a case of a depressed patient on hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presents with an acute agitated episode following a visual hallucination that he has been experiencing intermittently for six months, along with a three- to four-year history of cognitive impairments. Our differential diagnosis includes vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, pseudodementia, dialysis dementia, and early-onset Alzheimer’s. In this case, the findings of a normal mini-mental status exam (MMSE) and mental status exam (MSE) do not correlate with a working diagnosis. Due to persistent dilemmas in diagnosing early neurocognitive impairment, continued monitoring and re-assessment are necessitated for efficient management of psychiatric patients with cognitive decline.",

      "title": "Differentiating Psychosomatic, Somatopsychic, Multisystem Illnesses and Medical Uncertainty",
      "abstract": "There is often difficulty differentiating between psychosomatic, somatopsychic, multisystem illness, and different degrees of medical uncertainty. Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

      "title": "Neurocognitive functioning in bipolar disorder.",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychological processes may have direct bearing on the emotional dysregulation and functional impairments characteristic of bipolar disorder. Neuropsychological deficits that have been identified in adults and children with bipolar disorder include impairments in executive functions, declarative memory, attentional processes, and possibly working memory. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies of adults and children with bipolar disorder also indicate abnormalities in regions thought to underlie these neuropsychological deficits, including the basal ganglia, amygdala, and dorsolateral, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Study of this area is made challenging by the heterogeneity of bipolar disorder, the heterogeneity of neuropsychological deficits among groups of patients with different clinical characteristics, the lack of specificity of neurocognitive deficits for bipolar disorder, and difficulty ascertaining whether deficits are inherent in the disorder, predate the disorder, or are influenced by mood state, course, treatment, and comorbidity with other disorders. In this review, we integrate the literature on neuropsychological functioning and neuroimaging in both children and adults with bipolar disorder, propose a nascent integrative model of cognitive function in bipolar disorder, and make suggestions for future studies and model development.",

      "abstract": "Introduction 1.1 Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease Idiopathic Parkinson`s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by basal ganglia dysfunction frequently being associated with frontostriatal dysfunction and cognitive impairment.The prevalence of PD increases with age and is estimated at 100-200/100000 people (Chen et al., 2001;Schrag et al., 2000) worldwide.The clinical hallmarks of PD are akinesia, rigidity and tremor (Douglas et al., 1999;Hughes et al., 1992).In the past PD has been considered as a pure movement disorder, but in recent years the presence of non-motor symptoms in PD has been recognized.Non-motor symptoms include a variety of autonomic dysfunctions such as orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia, bladder dysfunction, sleep disturbances, psychiatric symptoms, i.e. depression, hallucinations or psychosis and cognitive impairment.Non-motor symptoms such as pain, depression or sleep disturbances might precede the onset of motor symptoms in PD and are sometimes even more disabling than motor deficits.For many years cognitive impairment and the occurrence of dementia have been considered as not typical for IPD.James Parkinson (Parkinson, 1817) wrote in his essay on the shaking palsy \" the senses are not disturbed\".However, there is now enough evidence in the literature that dementia might occur in up to 40% of PD-patients (Emre et al., 2004).PD dementia is the third most common reason for dementia.Dementia in PD has been associated with reduced quality of life, greater sensitivity to medication, higher risk of developing psychosis, shortened survival (Levy, 2002), increased caregivers stress and frequent transfer to nursing homes (Aarsland et al., 2000) compared to PD-patients without dementia.In contrast to dementia mild cognitive impairment might occur early in the course of the disease.Approximately, a quarter of PDpatients without dementia have mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 20% might have MCI at the time of diagnosis (Aarsland et al., 2011).The cognitive deficits in PD are specific and include executive dysfunction, attentional and visuospatial deficits.Executive functions include control, manipulation, and cognitive flexibility (",

Neurogenic arthropathy and subclinical neuropathy were also found in relatives. In three kinships, the underlying disorder was probably hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 and in several others, it was recessively inherited sensory neuropathy. These arthropathies were often painful, and overt loss of superficial and deep pain sensation was not a prominent or necessary condition. An interplay of multiple factors including insensitivity, trauma, obesity, activity, abuse, personality, mental subnormality, and metabolic joint and bone disease are probably involved in the development of the bony lesions and thus provide further evidence that environmental factors affect expression of human mutant genes for inherited ncuropathy.",

The importance of this is reflected in the differences between the main causes of monocular and binocular losses. In cases of transient monocular visual loss, an ocular cause has to be kept in mind so as to avoid unnecessary and costly cerebrovascular investigations. In cases of persistent monocular visual loss, a compressive lesion of the optic nerve or chiasma may simulate optic neuritis. In the evaluation of diplopia, the main differential diagnoses are nerve lesions and myasthenia. The main causes of nerve lesions responsible for diplopia and their workup are summarised. The usefulness of eye signs in the diagnosis of myasthenia is highlighted. The possibility of compressive lesions co-existing with or masquerading as myasthenia is emphasised.",

This study was designed to meet several of the criticisms of those previous studies. Using Research Diagnostic Criteria, we compared the sleep patterns of schizophrenic patients with those of normal controls and patients with major depressive disorder and schizoaffective disorder. All patients were medication free, and REM latency was explicitly defined using both strict and lenient criteria. Chronically ill paranoid or undifferentiated schizophrenics could not be distinguished from patients with major depressive disorder or schizoaffective disorder using any definition of REM latency. These results were not due to longer REM latency in the particular sample of patients with major depressive disorder. They had abnormally low REM latencies; however, the schizophrenic patients showed similar decrements. These data cast serious doubt on the specificity of short REM latency as a biological marker for major depressive disorder.",

The response of a maculopathy is the formation of a scotoma that can be relative or absolute with difficulty or impossibility to read, write and see the normal activities of daily life. The visually impaired person therefore has an insufficient level of visual ability to perform daily activities, work or leisure activities that are usual for individuals of the same age, sex and sociocultural status. A more or less serious low vision and a visual disability are thus created. The visually impaired person is able to use the eccentric visual residue in the preferential retinal network. With visual rehabilitation, a visual capacity lost by the patient is gained, developing eccentric fixation, giving the patient the awareness of his own possibilities to see and use the use of optical and electronic aids.",
