      "title": "Physical activity, participation and health-related quality of life in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple osteochondromas",
      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "abstract": "Chronic health conditions affect many children and adolescents. These conditions are illnesses or impairments that are expected to last for an extended period of time and require medical attention and care that is above and beyond what would normally be expected for a child or adolescent of the same age, extensive hospitalization, or in-home health services.1 These conditions include, among others, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, spina bifida, hemophilia, seizure disorders, neuromuscular disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and congenital heart diseases. Although each specific condition may be relatively or extremely rare, when they are considered together, many children and adolescents are affected. Health conditions may be characterized by their duration and their severity. Although these terms are often linked, they refer to different aspects of a health condition. A chronic condition is generally one that has lasted or is expected to last more than a defined period of time, usually 3 months or longer. Conditions vary widely in their onset, course, and duration.2 Severity refers to the impact a condition has on a child's physical, intellectual, psychological, or social functioning.3 This impact may occur as a result of persistent symptoms, required treatments, limitations of activity or mobility, or interference with school, recreation, work, and family activities. Current estimates are that between 10 and 20 million American children and adolescents have some type of chronic health condition or impairment. Most of these conditions are relatively mild and interfere little with the children's ability to participate in usual childhood activities.4 However.",

      "abstract": "During adolescence physical, psychic and social changes occure more rapidly and to a greater extent than during any other period of live. The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

Se considera que en mas de las tres cuartas partes de los mayores deprimidos pueden persistir sintomas residuales, dando lugar a estados postdepresivos en forma de depresiones menores, depresiones subum- brales o depresiones subsindromicas. Entre estos sintomas residuales mas frecuentes en los estados postdepresivos destacan las dificultades de concentracion, el enlenteci- miento, la astenia, los sintomas somaticos, los trastornos del sueno o la hipocondriasis. En los mayores son mas frecuentes las de- presiones subclinicas o subsindromicas, que frecuentemente aparecen tras la mejoria de un trastorno depresivo mayor. Los factores que se asocian para la aparicion de estas depresiones subsindromicas son de tipo so- ciodemografico (ausencia de contactos so- ciales), empeoramiento funcional, historia previa de trastornos afectivos, antecedentes de trastornos vasculares cerebrales o facto- res existenciales (preocupaciones sobre el futuro, baja percepcion de salud,..).

It is considered that in more than three quar- ters of elderly depressed may persist, giving rise to postdepressive states in the form of minor depressions, sub-threshold depres- sions or subsyndromic depressions. Among these most prevalents residual symptoms in postdepressive states are difficulties of con- centration, bradipsychia, asthenia, somatic symptoms, sleep disorders or hypochondria- sis. In elderly people, subclinical or subsyn- dromal depressions are more prevalent, which frequently appear after the improvement of a major depressive disorder. The factors that are associated for the appearance of these subsyndromic depressions are sociodemo- graphic factors (loss of social contacts), functional impairment, previous history of affective disorders, history of cerebrovascu- lar disorders or existential factors (concerns about the future, low perception of health, ..).

Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them.

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

Chronic pain is longer and presents either with a current physical source or after its apparent healing. Chronic pain perception involves fewer physical factors and more subjective factors. Recurrent pain syndromes, commonly headache and abdominal and limb pains, are painful and without apparent physical cause; however, they do not always imply a psychological disorder.",

Factors connected with the increased prevalence of sleep disturbance are female gender, presence of mental or somatic diseases and advanced age.

In the vast majority of cases, symptoms resolve within days or weeks. The most common symptoms include: difficulty with concentration and attention, slowed speed of mental processing, anxiety, emotional lability, sensitivity to noise, fatigue, dizziness, and/or headache. The statistics regarding postconcussion syndrome vary considerably with the population studied. Some individuals continue to have symptoms for 3 to 6 months; a subset experience problems even after 1 year. It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals. In all cases, the trauma experience has personal meaning for the person affected, and significant psychological reactions are common. Adaptive biological reactions occur in the postinjury period. These biological changes interact with the numerous psychological factors that come into play during the same time.",

Was aber, wenn die Beschwerden nicht vergehen, sie nicht eindeutig erklärbar sind und sie zu massiven Beeinträchtigungen führen, wie dies bei somatoformen Beschwerden der Fall ist? Somatoforme Beschwerden werden von den Betroffenen meist als sehr belastend erlebt und führen häufig zu erheblichen Einschränkungen im Berufsleben, in der Familie und in der Freizeitgestaltung. Die Lebensqualität der Betroffenen ist dadurch erheblich beeinträchtigt, nicht zuletzt auch durch die mit der Störung verbundenen Krankheitsängste. Diese wiederum beeinflussen das Krankheitsverhalten erheblich. Die Neuauflage des Ratgebers versucht, häufig gestellte Fragen von Menschen mit einer somatoformen Störung zu beantworten. Der Ratgeber spricht auch die Irritation vieler Betroffener an, die über körperliche Beschwerden klagen, jedoch die Empfehlung erhalten, eine Psychotherapeutin bzw. einen Psychotherapeuten aufzusuchen. Der Ratgeber informiert über verschiedene Behandlungsangebote und gibt zahlreiche Empfehlungen für den Umgang mit somatoformen Beschwerden und hypochondrischen Ängsten. Er erläutert, was die Beschwerden chronisch werden lässt und wie Betroffene lernen können, ihren Alltag trotz der Beeinträchtigungen positiv zu gestalten.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a clinical anxiety disorder that is centrally characterized by excessive, pervasive, and chronic worry. Worry is a cognitive activity that involves repeatedly thinking about potential negative future events, such as “What if I can't finish this task?” “What if I never graduate?” “What if I have some type of illness?” According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), in order to warrant a diagnosis of GAD an individual must experience excessive and uncontrollable worry for at least 6 months, as well as three or more associated symptoms that are present, more days than not, over this time period. These associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances (e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep). Consistent with other DSM‐IV diagnostic criteria, both the worry and associated symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment.",

      "abstract": "Described over a century ago, schizophrenia still presents personal, clinical and scientific challenges, and is increasingly considered a concept rather than a single disorder. It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "title": "Premenstruális szindróma és premenstruális dysphoriás zavar.",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle in daily life and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. The onset and severity of PMS are determined by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the combined presence of other physiological (e.g., chronobiological and circadian) and psychological stressors, which interact with each other. The diagnosis of PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is based on the following criteria, as recommended by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD): in PMS, the woman has 1-4 symptoms, which may be physical, behavioural or affective/psychological, or at least five symptoms, which may be physical or behavioural. However, if a woman has 5 or more symptoms, and one of these is affective (e.g., irritability, mood swings, anger) in addition to physical or behavioural symptoms, a more accurate diagnosis of PMDD can be made. Since, in addition to the general and gynecological history, the prospective scales (e.g., Prospective record of the impact and severity of menstrual symptoms - PRISM; Daily record of severity of problems - DRSP) completed daily by the physician are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PMS and PMDD, it is important to take into account the severity of symptoms, the woman's plans for conception or contraceptive needs, her other associated medical conditions, her response to previous treatment methods, and her history of other medical conditions when formulating a treatment plan. Therapeutic options include regular aerobic exercise, stress relief, cognitive behavioural therapy, drug treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs, combined oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives - COCs, GnRH agonists), -depending on the severity of PMS and PMDD.A premenstruális szindróma (PMS) a reproduktív életkorú nők egyik leggyakoribb problémája. A fizikai, mentális és magatartásbeli tünetek a ciklus lutealis fázisában jelentkeznek visszatérően, és életminőség-romlást okoznak a mindennapi életben, befolyásolva a páciens szociális, munkahelyi és családi kapcsolatait. A tünetekre jellemző, hogy pár nap alatt a menstruáció kezdete után spontán eltűnnek. A PMS és a premenstruációs dysphoriás zavar (PMDD) diagnózisa a következő kritériumok alapján állítható fel a Premenstruális Rendellenességek Nemzetközi Társaságának (International Society for Premenstrual Disorders – ISPMD) ajánlása szerint: a PMS esetében a nőnek 1–4 tünete van, amelyek lehetnek fizikai, viselkedési vagy affektív/pszichológiai jellegűek, vagy minimum 5 tünettel rendelkezik, melyek fizikai vagy viselkedési jellegűek. Ha viszont egy nőnek 5 vagy több tünete van, és ezek közül az egyik affektív tünet (például ingerlékenység, hangulatingadozás, düh) a fizikai vagy viselkedési tünetek mellett, akkor a pontosabb PMDD diagnózisa állítható fel. A diagnózisok megerősítéséhez az általános és a nőgyógyászati anamnézis mellett a páciens által naponta kitöltött prospektív skálák, például a menstruációs tünetek hatásának és súlyosságának prospektív nyilvántartása, továbbá a problémák súlyosságának napi nyilvántartási skálája jelent segítséget. A terápiás terv kialakításakor fontos figyelembe venni a tünetek súlyosságát, a nő fogamzási terveit vagy fogamzásgátlási igényeit, a társuló egyéb betegségeit és a korábbi kezelési módszerekre adott válaszát. A terápiás lehetőségek közé tartozik – a PMS és a PMDD súlyosságától függően – a rendszeres aerob testmozgás, a stresszoldás, a kognitív viselkedésterápia, a gyógyszeres kezelések (szelektív szerotoninvisszavétel-gátlók, kombinált oralis ösztrogén-progesztin fogamzásgátlók, GnRH-agonisták).

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

Symptoms of grief include physical and psychological changes including body aches, anxiety, and emotional pain. Grief has been conceptualized both as a series of stages or phases and as a period of meaning‐making. Furthermore, a variety of factors related to characteristics of the griever, the nature of the loss, and available support may influence grief processes and health outcomes. When grief becomes particularly distressing or prolonged, individuals can experience complicated grief, which is tied to more negative grief outcomes. Individuals with stronger support networks may experience improved health effects during bereavement.",

Medicine, psychiatry belongs to that part of the alcohol abuse which has the characteristics of the disease, the disease of addiction. Suppresses the craving for alcohol and changed all mental functions, emotions, morality, accountability, value systems and encourages those traits that serve the satisfaction of desire - manipulative, passivity, impatience, recklessness, self-centeredness, hedonism.Dependence means the state of periodic or chronic intoxication with alcohol and is characterized by: a strong desire and need for acquiring and consuming alcohol, the tendency of increasing amounts of alcohol taken, physical and psychological dependence, adverse health consequences and distortions in social and professional functioning.There are several different divisions of alcoholics, today in most of our institutions and the distribution of benefits by the way alcoholics drinking on periodic and continuous (daily), which is easier and more convenient to use. In order to evaluate whether social status affect the way drinking alcohol, we investigated the medical social characteristics and differences between alcoholics with periodic and continuous drinking.The results of our study indicate that alcoholics consume alcohol periodically are mostly unmarried, living with friends more frequently in rural areas, are employed and have children. Family history is burdened by their addiction to alcohol and often come not treatment to avoid legal sanctions. Alcoholics with continuous drinking more frequently as a result of the facts of alcoholism are alcoholic polinuropatiju, in most cases, are divorced, live alone and have no children. They grew up with a father or both parents, in these alcoholics no existence, depending on the family or the father has, have trouble with the law as well as injuries in a drunken state. The higher percentage have komoriditet with depressive disorders.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation.

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain",
      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4. Endometriosis Adhesions (chronic pelvic inflammatory disease/previous pelvic surgery) Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts/dermoids Pelvic congestion syndrome Adenomyosis Malignancy. Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Despite wide-ranging clinical use of antidepressants to treat depression alone as well as depression associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), there have been no reports to date on the use of serotonin reuptake inhibition with a successful outcome of both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PCOS symptomatology, such as oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and hirsutism.\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

The onset is insidious and gradual, although the patient, usually a woman, may associate its beginning with some unusual dietary event, as a party, or indulgence above the ordinary in unusual foods. This event, however, should it occur, usually marks a culmination rather than a commencement. The several typical symptoms, which, let it be emphasized again, are quantitative rather than qualitative, are: (1) constipation; (2) fatigue, which is manifested by a marked disproportion between the mental desire for accomplishment and the physical inability of realization; (3) meteorism; (4) precordial or",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

During adolescence, there are many things that cause people in general to experience mental disorders. Some mental disorders that usually occur are caused by various existing stressors which can cause anxiety disorders, depression and lead to suicide. Adolescents who grow up in a conducive environment will rarely experience mental disorders which are usually suffered by most teenagers who experience these mental disorders. This mental disorder can be prevented. There are many mental disorders whose symptoms and causes are difficult to determine. It is sometimes difficult to see the difference between ordinary teenage moodiness and signs of more serious illness, although the illness usually begins in late adolescence or young adulthood.

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is the most serious and disabling of all mental disorders, affecting just under 1 % of the population. While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Outcome in adulthood generally falls into three groups: fairly normal outcome, persistent attentional, social, emotional and impulse problems, and serious psychiatric and/or social pathology. Factors affecting outcome include characteristics related to the child (for example, health, temperament, IQ) and characteristics of the family (for example, socioeconomic status, emtional and psychological aspects of the family, family composition and structure, and the larger social and physical environment.",

The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness.

      "abstract": "Peningkatan suara dengan gelombang kompleks yang tidak beraturan dikenal sebagai bising, merupakan salah satu stresor bagi individu. Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

Sikap berdiri lama yang melebihi 20 menit dapat memberikan stress pada otot posterior tubuh dan persendian columna vertebralis, terutama di regio lumbal yang dapat menimbulkan keluhan NPB dengan tingkat dan kualitas nyeri yang bervariasi. Adanya faktor pekerjaan seperti beban kerja, lama kerja, sikap kerja, bantuan alat, dan banyaknya jam istirahat, serta faktor personal, seperti usia, merokok, jenis kelamin dan IMT, dapat ikut mempengaruhi kemunculan NPB pada seseorang, sehingga seseorang yang memiliki masa kerja yang lebih lama beresiko lebih besar mengalami keluhan NPB daripada seseorang yang memiliki masa kerja baru.

Although physical activity accompanying these emotions may account for some of the physical symptoms occurring during pleasure, in other instances there was no accompanying physical activity. It seems likely that in some predisposed persons any strong emotion, whether positive or negative, may precipitate physical symptoms. Physical symptoms with positive emotional states probably occur much more often than is generally recognized.",

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

      "title": "Depressão puerperal e seu difícil diagnóstico",
      "abstract": "Introdução: O parto é um processo difícil e exaustivo, e no puerpério, a mulher passa por um período de grande vulnerabilidade, associado a intensas alterações físicas e emocionais. A depressão pós-parto ocorre mais comumente 6 semanas após o parto, em cerca de 6,5% a 20% das mulheres. Embora as mulheres que sofrem de tristeza pós-parto tendem a se recuperar rapidamente, a depressão puerperal tende a durar mais tempo e afeta gravemente a capacidade das mulheres de retornar às funções normais. Por ser definida como um transtorno depressivo maior, exigem critérios de diagnóstico, como sintomas de humor deprimido ou a perda de interesse ou prazer nas atividades presentes por pelo menos duas semanas. Além disso, podem estar presentes distúrbios do sono, distúrbios do apetite, perda de energia, sentimentos de inutilidade ou culpa, diminuição da concentração e pensamentos suicidas. O diagnóstico e o tratamento da depressão pós-parto são desafiadores, isso porque as alterações nos padrões de sono e no apetite, além da fadiga excessiva, são rotina para as mulheres após o parto, e nem todo tratamento trará benefícios à paciente. Objetivo: O presente trabalho tem como objetivo evidenciar a importância e o diagnóstico da depressão puerperal. Métodos: Para a confecção desta revisão de literatura, foi realizada pesquisa nas bases de dados Medical Literature Analysis and Retrievel System Online (MEDLINE), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) e Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS), além de documentos oficiais do Ministério da Saúde. Na busca, foram utilizadas as palavras-chave “depressão puerperal”, “gestação” e “transtornos psiquiátricos”. Foram aplicados os filtros “revisão bibliografica” e “relato de caso”. A amostra de estudo foi composta por textos em português e inglês com publicação no intervalo entre os anos de 2020 e 2024. Aplicando-se esses critérios, 20 artigos foram pesquisados, dos quais 8 deles foram selecionados. Resultados: Os resultados destacam a prevalência significativa da depressão puerperal em todo o mundo, bem como fatores de risco conhecidos, como história prévia de transtornos mentais, falta de apoio social, eventos estressantes durante a gestação e parto complicado. Além disso, as abordagens de triagem e diagnóstico; intervenções terapêuticas, incluindo psicoterapia e farmacoterapia; e medidas preventivas para reduzir o impacto da depressão puerperal na saúde materna e infantil ainda são controversas e precisam ser individualizadas de acordo com cada paciente. Conclusões: A depressão puerperal é uma condição que tem se tornado cada vez mais comum e que requer atenção cuidadosa por parte dos profissionais de saúde. Estratégias de triagem eficazes, intervenções terapêuticas baseadas em evidências e apoio contínuo são fundamentais para identificar e tratar adequadamente mulheres afetadas por essa condição. Além disso, políticas de saúde pública que promovam o acesso equitativo a cuidados de saúde mental perinatais são essenciais para mitigar os efeitos adversos da depressão puerperal na saúde materna e infantil.",

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

Answering ‘yes’ may indicate that you are just experiencing normal concern about the usual tribulations oflife. Alternatively, your worrying may be an indicator that you have a mental disorder. Establishing whether worrying is a symptom of a psychiatric disorder, or merely a normal experience, requires answers to a number of supplementary questions such as ‘What’s it like when you worry?’ ‘Can you turn your attention to anything else?’ and ‘How much of the time over the past month have you worried?’ When worrying becomes a recurrent and painful round of thoughts, so that it is difficult to turn your attention to anything else and takes up much of your time, then your worrying is more likely to be a symptom of a mental disorder (Wing et al. 1974).",

These neuropsychiatric sequelae have considerable functional consequences at the level of the individual, society, and the broader economy. Neuropsychiatric long covid symptoms are thought to be causally diverse, and a range of risk factors as well as biological, psychological, and environmental mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to symptom development and persistence. When present, objective cognitive deficits tend to be modest for most individuals, with some evidence suggesting increased risk of dysfunction and decline specifically for older adults with a history of severe acute illness. Longitudinal data suggest a delayed emergence of psychiatric symptoms may occur in the weeks and months after an acute covid illness. Emerging research points to the early recovery period as a potential window of opportunity for intervention to alter patient trajectories, though evidence based treatment remains lacking.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "abstract": "Overtraining syndrome is a condition of prolonged fatigue and decreased athletic performance caused by excessive training overload without adequate rest and recovery. Outcome can be psychological and physiological disturbances that can slow down progress or even downgrade performance.\r\n Prevalence of the syndrome is higher among professional runners because of setting higher demands on their bodies, indispensable for achieving top results. But syndrome also targets beginners or recreational runners.\r\n Excessive physical overload is considered to be the main cause of overtraining syndrome, but every other psychological and social stressors can atribute. In fact, accumulation of all the stressors causes collapse of the adaptation mechanisms and long term negative symptoms occur. Individual capacity for stress plays an important role in the development of the syndrome.\r\n Diagnosis of the overtraining syndrome is clinical and accomplished through history, which should demonstrate the following: (1) decreased performance persisting despite weeks and months of recovery, (2) disturbances in mood, and (3) lack of signs and symptoms or diagnosis of other possible causes of underperformance.\r\n Recovery last for weeks, often even months.\r\n It is hard to predict which runner will develop overtraining. Therefore, prevention is the key.\r\n Main components of prevention are education and follow up.\r\n Balance between optimal training and recovery is a strategy of success.\r\n Right amount od training overload and enough time to rest will result in an additional motivation, as psychological, and as physiological set out for new triumph.",

Funktionelle gastrointestinale Störungen lassen sich durch eine angemessene organmedizinische Diagnostik und eine ausführliche Anamnese hinreichend verlässlich diagnostizieren. Die Rom-III-Klassifikation liefert eine umfangreiche Beschreibung funktioneller gastrointestinaler Störungen; in der psychosozialen Medizin wird die Diagnose einer somatoformen Störung vergeben. Patienten mit funktionellen gastrointestinalen Beschwerden haben ein erhöhtes Risiko für komorbide psychische Belastungen und Beeinträchtigungen. Patienten im psychosomatischen oder psychiatrischen Versorgungsbereich leiden ebenfalls häufig unter komorbiden funktionellen gastrointestinalen Syndromen. Führen medikamentöse Behandlungsversuche nicht zum Erfolg oder besteht eine psychische Komorbidität, sollte eine psychosomatische oder psychotherapeutische Behandlung initiiert werden. Ebenso kann eine psychopharmakologische Behandlung hilfreich sein. Die therapeutische Interaktion wird oft als anstrengend und frustrierend erlebt. Daher sollte die therapeutische Beziehung aktiv gestaltet werden; eine psychosoziale Perspektive kann schrittweise in die therapeutische Arbeit eingeführt werden.",

When these symptoms continue for ≥1 month and are associated with daytime dysfunction or distress, they reach the status of an insomnia disorder. Roughly 10% of adults in the United States have an insomnia disorder (hereafter referred to as insomnia), ie, that which is present on most nights and lasts ≥4 weeks. Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

Lakshanas of Vishada in ayurveda can be Kayika, Vachika, and Manasika lakshanas. It is caused by the vitiation of Vata (Sharirika dosha) and Raja (Manasika dosha). Vitiation of Vata and Raja gets seated in Hridya (Heart) and ultimately causes vitiation of mind (Vibhrama) which finally leads to Vishada. Depression isn’t the same as being sad. It’s normal to feel blue or unmotivated from time to time, but depression is more constant.

The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical. This article discusses the comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.",

Las soluciones ni son simples ni uniformes en los diferentes sindromes, que algunas veces se asocian con patologias conocidas como el sindrome de Down, rubeola congenita, sindromes de Rett o de la X fragil, embriopatia por valproato, etc. Para hacer un diagnostico de autismo, el DSM-IV –de la Asociacion Americana de Psiquiatria- indica que es necesario encontrar las siguientes caracteristicas: A. Un total de seis o mas manifestaciones de (1), (2) y (3), con l menos dos de (1), al menos una de (2), y al menos una de (3). 1. Trastorno cualitativo de la relacion, expresado como minimo en dos de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Trastorno importante en muchas conductas de relacion no verbal, como la mirada a los ojos, la expresion facial, las posturas corporales y los gestos para regular la interaccion social. b. Incapacidad para desarrollar relaciones con iguales adecuadas al nivel de desarrollo. c. Ausencia de conductas espontaneas encaminadas a compartir placeres, intereses o logros con otras personas (por ejemplo, de conductas de senalar o mostrar objetos de interes). d. Falta de reciprocidad social o emocional.  2. Trastornos cualitativos de la comunicacion, expresados como minimo en una de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Retraso o ausencia completa de desarrollo del lenguaje oral (que no se intenta compensar con medios alternativos de comunicacion, como los gestos o mimica). b. En personas con habla adecuada, trastorno importante en la capacidad de iniciar o mantener conversaciones. c. Empleo estereotipado o repetitivo del lenguaje, o uso de un lenguaje idiosincrasico. d. Falta de juego de ficcion espontaneo y variado, o de juego de imitacion social adecuado al nivel de desarrollo. 3. Patrones de conducta, interes o actividad restrictivos, repetitivos y estereotipados, expresados como minimo en una de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Preocupacion excesiva por un foco de interes (o varios) restringido y estereotipado, anormal por  su intensidad o contenido. b. Adhesion aparentemente inflexible a rutinas o rituales especificos y no funcionales. c. Estereotipias motoras repetitivas (por ejemplo, sacudidas de manos, retorcer los dedos, movimientos complejos de todo el cuerpo, etc.). d. Preocupacion persistente por partes de objetos. B.

Sometimes biological aspects cause SBS, sometimes the chemicals present in your building, but human biological systems are affected. This paper reveal a review of SBS, including symptoms, causes, effects, work-related illnesses, prevention, and control. Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) is a medical condition where people experience unexplained symptoms of illness or discomfort while occupying a building. The severity of these symptoms tends to worsen with prolonged stay in the building, but improves or disappears once they leave. SBS can have significant consequences, including: Impaired work or school performance, strained personal relationships, Reduced attendance, Decreased productivity. SBS can occur in various settings, such as: Offices, Homes, Schools, Nurseries. Common symptoms of SBS include: Eye problems (irritation, watering, dryness), Respiratory issues (runny or blocked nose, sore throat), Skin problems (itching, dryness), Headaches, Fatigue, Lethargy, Poor concentration. Overall, SBS can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life and productivity, making it essential to identify and address the underlying causes of the condition.",

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older.

At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal.

      "title": "Depression and Cardiac Risk",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder among American adults, with lifetime prevalence rates of up to 25% in women and 12% in men, and point prevalence rates of 6% in women and 3% in men.1 These gender differences are relatively constant over adulthood, although there is evidence that the prevalence of MDD is increasing and the age of first onset is decreasing. Major depressive disorder is even more common among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), with estimates ranging from 16% to 27%, and an additional 20% to 30% of cardiac patients with minor depression (mDD) or elevated depressive symptoms.2 Major depressive disorder is best diagnosed by a psychiatric interview. To meet criteria for MDD, a patient must report sad or “depressed” mood or a significant loss of interest in all or most things that were previously considered enjoyable for a minimum of 2 weeks, and at least an additional 4 (or 3, if both dysphoric mood and loss of pleasure are present) of the following symptoms: significant weight loss or change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, decreased concentration or indecisiveness, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Minor depression (mDD) is not yet an official psychiatric diagnosis, but rather is a clinical syndrome often used for research purposes. Its features are similar to MDD, but with fewer depressive symptoms and less impairment. An episode of mDD involves either a sad or depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities, and a total of at least 2 but less than 5 additional depressive symptoms. Dysthymia is marked by a chronically depressed mood state for at least 2 years. At least 2 additional depressive symptoms are present without meeting criteria for MDD. Self-report instruments such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Zung Depression Scale, or the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D) can also reliably assess depressive symptoms, although questionnaires cannot diagnose MDD and should not be considered a substitute for clinical interviews for diagnostic purposes. In this issue of the journal, Todaro and colleagues report that more than 20% of patients enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) met criteria for a current depressive disorder, including 9.1% for MDD, 6.4% for mDD, and 5.5% for dysthmia. These figures may be somewhat lower than expected, based on previous reports.2 However, the lower estimates may be attributable to the relatively small sample size, selective enrollment (only 82% of eligible CR participants agreed to undergo the psychiatric assessment), and use of an unfamiliar instrument, the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule, for the diagnosis and severity rating of depression. In addition, it is possible that patients who are referred for CR—and more importantly, follow through with the referral—may not be representative of the general cardiac population. Indeed it has been shown that patients with depression are less likely to adhere to prescribed medical therapies, including participation in CR services.3 More striking, however, was the prevalence of depression among female patients, with 43% of female CR participants meeting criteria for depressive disorder during their lifetimes compared with only 19% among males. Furthermore, almost 29% of women in the study met criteria for a current depressive disorder compared with only 9% of men. These are sobering figures and are significant for a number of important reasons: depression takes a devastating toll on patients' quality of life; adversely affects marital and social relations; results in increased use of social and medical services; is associated with more days in bed or days away from normal activities; and is responsible for enormous financial costs for treatment, lost productivity, and absenteeism from work. In addition, there is mounting evidence that depression is associated with worse prognosis, with a 2- to 5-fold increase in relative risk in patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction (MI),4 congestive heart failure,5 and post—coronary artery bypass surgery.6 Moreover, mDD, dysthymia, and even subclinical depression as measured by elevated scores on self-report instruments such as BDI and CES-D scales are associated with increased risk.2 Thus, not only recognizing depression but also successfully treating it has become a priority. Several recent studies have assessed the extent to which depression can be successfully treated in cardiac populations. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely considered to be safe for patients with CHD. For example, the SADHART study showed that sertraline did not adversely affect cardiac function and was safe for most patients.7 While non-significant or modest reductions in depressive symptoms were noted in the sample as a whole, evidence suggested that treatment was effective for patients with recurrent or more severe depression. There is also great interest in nonpharmacological approaches to treatment. Behavior therapy, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and interpersonal psychotherapy all have been shown to be efficacious in treating depression in healthy, depressed populations without CHD. In addition, the ENRICHD trial recently showed that similar to antidepressant medication, CBT is modestly effective in reducing depression in acute post-MI patients.8 Evidence suggests that exercise therapy also may be an effective treatment for depression,9 and exercise after an acute MI has recently been reported to be associated with significantly reduced morbidity and mortality among patients with MDD,10 suggesting that exercise is a promising intervention for patients with CHD and depression. It remains to be seen whether treating depression may reduce risk of adverse events in depressed CHD patients. Although the ENRICHD trial failed to demonstrate that reducing depression improved survival, antidepressant use was actually associated with better clinical outcomes, independent of the effects on depression. Additional randomized controlled trials need to be undertaken with cardiac patients who are depressed to examine efficacy for psychosocial and “hard” clinical endpoints. It should be noted that because of improvements in the surgical and medical management of patients, it is possible that treating depression may not reduce significantly the risk of death or reinfarction over and above standard risk factors such as CHD severity and the presence of medical cormorbidities. Nevertheless, depression remains a highly prevalent and insidious comorbid condition in cardiac patients and needs to be recognized and treated, if not to prolong life then certainly to enhance patients' quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Both physical and mental health is intimately linked. People who have a significant mental illness are more prone to suffer from a variety of chronic physical diseases. People who have long-term medical issues, on the other hand are more than twice as likely to be depressed and anxiety as the general population. The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

Sometimes, the most important problems following concussion are not immediately apparent to the patient.

      "title": "Psychosocial problems observed in older adults after disaster",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Natural disasters are large‐scale catastrophic events that seriously disrupt the functioning of a community or society. The frequency and severity of disasters are increasing and involve widespread human, material, economic, or environmental impacts that exceed the ability of the society affected by them to cope using its resources. In addition, disasters significantly affect the physical, emotional, and psychological health of individuals and cause numerous deaths, injuries, and economic losses. One of the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of disasters is the elderly. The increase in the elderly population worldwide brings with it the problems specific to this period and the service needs for these problems. The population consists of older adults, who are among the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of natural disasters. During the social traumatisation process triggered by natural disasters, elderly people experience intense feelings of anxiety, fear, anger, helplessness, loneliness, hopelessness, futurelessness, and insecurity. Reactions such as unresponsiveness, alienation, inability to focus, and inability to remember are normal during this process. The normality of these feelings and responses in the acute period, which can last up to 3 months, will give way to abnormality unless the necessary physical and psychosocial conditions are provided. When the necessary psychosocial conditions are not provided, elderly individuals who experience a disaster may experience mental problems such as post‐traumatic stress disorder, depression, somatisation disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. In this context, providing the necessary psychosocial support for older adults to cope with psychosocial problems after a disaster and facilitating access to this support is very important in terms of adapting to the post‐disaster period.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

Acute stress responses in young, healthy individuals may be adaptive and typically do not impose a health burden. However, if the threat is unremitting, particularly in older or unhealthy individuals, the long-term effects of stressors can damage health. The relationship between psychosocial stressors and disease is affected by the nature, number, and persistence of the stressors as well as by the individual's biological vulnerability (i.e., genetics, constitutional factors), psychosocial resources, and learned patterns of coping. Psychosocial interventions have proven useful for treating stress-related disorders and may influence the course of chronic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

      "title": "Factors affecting chronic lack of sleep among students. Methods of combating insomnia during university studies",
      "abstract": "Everyone can feel tired at times during the week, and the reasons for this are often quite obvious, including late nights, early starts, sleep disturbances or stress. But some students feel tired all the time, despite a good night's sleep. Constant tiredness and exhaustion are not normal and can be detrimental to mental and physical health. Lack of sleep due to stress is a serious problem among students. This condition has many negative consequences for health and academic performance. Consider the impact of stress on students' sleep and how it affects their lives. The impact of stress on students' sleep in its manifestation has the following effects: physiological effects of stress: increased cortisol levels, stress causes the release of cortisol, a stress hormone that makes it difficult to relax and fall asleep. The sympathetic nervous system also reacts, its activation due to stress leads to increased heart rate and increased readiness of the body for action, which prevents falling asleep. The psychological effects of stress are manifested by a state of worry and anxiety, stress is often accompanied by thoughts about problems and future tasks that prevent relaxation. Long-term stress can lead to depressive states, which negatively affect the quality of sleep. Social and behavioral factors are revealed through the academic load, high demands of learning, preparing for exams and performing tasks that increase the level of stress. Often, due to studies and social life, students neglect a regular sleep schedule, which worsens its quality and disrupts the daytime routine itself. There are major consequences of lack of sleep, which are manifested due to a decrease in immunity, chronic lack of sleep reduces the body's resistance to infections. There is a great risk of diseases. Lack of sleep is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. Cognitive disorders are reflected in mental health. Lack of sleep impairs memory, concentration and learning ability. Emotional instability leads to lack of sleep, increases feelings of anxiety, depression and irritability. Academic success is also not on the sidelines: the effectiveness of learning is significantly reduced. Lack of sleep affects the ability to absorb new information and reduces productivity. Poor performance appears: Students who suffer from sleep deprivation often perform the worst in exams and in studies in general.",

Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments.

Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

However, there is growing evidence for the role of habit forming in OCD. That questions the role of affective symptoms in OCD, such as anxiety or disgust. However affective symptoms, in particular depressive symptoms and anxiety, also occur during the course of OCD. How do affective symptoms and obsessive-compulsive symptoms relate to each other during the longterm course of OCD? These questions were investigated during provoked obessive-compulsive symptoms as well as during the six-years-course of OCD. The conclusion is that affective symptoms have an important role regarding the experience and the course of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms and that affective and obsessive-compulsive symptoms affect each other during the longterm course of OCD.",

The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

Such depression and anxiety can last several months and even a year and may be accompanied by symptoms such as frequent weeping with apparently no external or internal reason, lethargy, having no motivation to carry daily tasks, sleeping too much or too little, increased or reduced appetite, and diminished interest in social events. Internet forums and blogs can serve as a good source of emotional support. Women use them much more frequently than men, and they report using these forums mainly to get empathy, warmth, understanding, sense of belonging, and to share their feelings. Almost any decision making process bears potential feelings of discomfort and at times even stress, anxiety, and a feeling of loss of control over one's life.",

Nevertheless it is possible to draw the following conclusions out of the scientific papers and experiences of our own: A chronicity of depressive long-term courses is expected on old and higher age. Somatic diseases and organic brain syndrome render more difficult the amelioration and pharmacotherapy. The symptoms of affective disorders in old age most differ from depression in early and adult biographic phase. The course of dementias take off age and attendant somatic illness. In old age increase dementias. Their prognosis is worse. Added somatic process affects the further course negatively and renders more difficult the therapy. Long-term courses of dementias in old and higher age complicate the precise differential-diagnostic attach on pathogenetics.

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ).

At any one time, around 1 in 5 adults will report symptoms of low back pain, rising to 40% when asked if they have experienced symptoms during the previous month. The majority of people who experience an episode of low back pain will improve over time. However a sizeable proportion experience repeated episodes or recurrences, and some report continuous symptoms for many years. A wide range of factors are linked to both the onset and persistence of low back pain. Some studies have related age and gender to low back pain, but the link overall is equivocal. Work-related factors such as heavy lifting, and socio-demographic factors such as smoking and obesity have been linked with the onset of low back pain. High levels of functional impairment and the presence of pain radiating to the leg have been cited as factors associated with a poor prognosis among primary care consulters with low back pain. Other characteristics associated with both the development and the persistence of low back pain include psychological factors such as depression and anxiety and workplace factors such as job satisfaction. Low back pain places large demands on health, social and welfare systems. Further research is needed to identify practical interventions to reduce this burden from low back pain.",

A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity.

Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary.

      "abstract": "Summary In normal trained dogs many trivial factors such as strangers in the laboratory, previous noise and confusion in the kennels, changes in the daily experimental routine, an unexpected change of experimenters, or the presence of a female dog in estrus may cause pronounced emotional disturbances resulting in marked and sudden elevation of blood pressure. The extent of the emotional blood pressure response depends upon the natural emotional reactivity of the animal and the degree of training, being most pronounced in highly trained animals. These factors must be considered in experiments on trained dogs when it is important to avoid emotional tension. It is possible that frequent daily repetitions of these emotional states may over a period of months or years lead to morphological changes in the kidneys and cardiovascular system with persistent elevation of blood pressure. It is reasonable to assume that the high degree of restraint and conditioning which are characteristic of the daily existence of the average human subject may eventually result in a similar state of irritability of the vasomotor centers so that minor changes in the daily routine or environment may lead to repeated and excessive acute blood pressure elevations and over a period of years become a factor in the genesis of certain types of hypertension.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

Therapists commonly hear about vegetative symptoms: sleep, energy level, appetite and weight, libido. These may be evidence of a psychological or a medical illness. Physical signs are clues to the presence of an organic diagnosis and require a medical workup. It is problematic to assume that physical signs represent a conversion disorder or that they are unrelated to the patient's mental status changes. Physical signs with far-reaching significance include neurological soft signs, asymmetry of structure and/or function, abnormal eye movements, disturbance in body movement.",

Ein häufig zitiertes Beispiel dafür ist die multiple Sklerose. 2. Patienten mit organisch bedingten körperlichen Symptomen, die durch psychosoziale Stressfaktoren verstärkt werden. Typische Beispiele dafür sind chronische Schmerzen, z.B. Kopf-, Rücken-, Magen- oder Unterbauchschmerzen. 3. Patienten mit einer primär psychiatrischen Störung, die von den Betroffenen und den behandelnden Ärzten anfangs aufgrund der im Vordergrund stehenden körperlichen Beschwerden noch nicht als die entscheidende zugrunde liegende Störung erkannt wurde. Typische Beispiele sind: depressive Episode, Panikstörung, generalisierte Angststörung, Anpassungsstörung, Störung durch psychotrope Substanzen. 4. Patienten mit körperlichen Symptomen in eindeutigem Zusammenhang mit psychosozialen Stressfaktoren, sodass ein Kausalzusammenhang wahrscheinlich erscheint. Das typische Beispiel dafür stellt die Konversionsstörung dar. 5. Patienten mit anhaltenden bzw. ständig wiederkehrenden multiplen und oft wechselnden körperlichen Symptomen, für die auch nach langem Beobachtungszeitraum keine (ausreichenden) organischen Ursachen gefunden werden können.

Although pathalophysiological abnormalities exist across many domain, but several lines of research suggest that it may be distinct from psychiatric disorder. The nature of the symptoms, however, can help clinicians differentiate CFS from other illnesses.

Social factors are the most important determinants of health status. Reducing social adversity and childhood trauma would improve the physical and mental health of the population. Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

When we find a case in which there is great nervous instability combined with physical weakness, and usually with absence of distinct organic disease, especially if there are present some or all of the moral defects which so commonly accompany pronounced hysterical disease, then we have a symptomcomplex calling for treatment by rest and isolation.

      "abstract": "Key Points Anxiety symptoms (eg, fears about harm to self or loved ones; distress when child is asked to engage in feared activity; somatic complaints associated with fears) are common in children and adolescents; at some life stages and in some circumstances, a certain level of anxiety is developmentally appropriate.Anxiety symptoms may be features of 1 of 6 anxiety disorders or may cause functional impairment in the absence of a diagnosable disorder. Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

      "title": "Post-traumatic stress disorder",
      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

Adverse effects may ensue in a number of physical illnesses and major depressive illness may supervene. Stress and depression consistently impair the immune response to illness as in cardiac disorders, infections and cancer. The etiology of stress-induced illness is multi-faceted but six important components and six relevant symptoms can be derived from the alphabetical constitution of word itself. In the acute stress situation these changes rapidly revert to normal with cessation of challenge, but with long continued stress, they may become perpetuated and result in adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. An increasing awareness of the role that stress may play in the etiology of sustained hypertension might well lead to a better control of stress factors in the patient's life. Thus, he or she may be spared the \"life sentence\" of antihypertensive drug therapy, which itself may constitute a potent stress factor.",

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

The essential characteristics of AD is the presence of clinically significant emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable psychosocial stressor. Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

Two stages of old age are currently recognized: early old age (65 to 75 years) and over 75 years - late old age period. Old age period is the third life cycle period in which aging of the brain and eventual pathological changes with respective organic psychopathological onsets are finalized. In many countries, number of the population over 65 years of age increases. The same applies for our country. Term of psychic disorders includes miscellaneous psychic conditions, pathologic in terms of symptom intensity, personality and social behavior changes, and reflects on social life of the ill individual and its family. Psychiatric syndromes and disorders in older population Rogina divides into two groups: - disorders of emotional reacting and behavior, without manifestations of other organic brain or physical disorders and - alternations caused by primary brain pathology, clinically presented as organic brain psycho-syndrome with different intensity and different pathogenesis etymology (cardiovascular, cerebro-vascular, neoplastic, metabolic, etc.) A combination of physical illness and mental disorder is the most common cause of the first hospitalization in older age.",

      "abstract": "Typisch für Depressionen ist – und dies gilt auch im Alter –, dass sie häufig, multifaktoriell bedingt, unterdiagnostiziert und untertherapiert sind, erläuterte PD M. Axel Wollmer, Chefarzt der Klinik für Gerontopsychiatrie an der Asklepios Klinik Nord – Ochsenzoll Hamburg. Bis zu 20 % der über 65-Jährigen leiden an einer depressiven Störung und etwa 6 % davon erfüllen die diagnostischen Kriterien einer depressiven Episode. Häufig stehen jedoch bei dieser Klientel andere Erkrankungen im Vordergrund und die Beschwerden werden als körperliche Erkrankungen oder \"normale\" Alterserscheinung (Agism) fehlinterpretiert. Erschwerend kommt dazu, dass Depressionen im Alter oft atypisch bzw. subsyndromal verlaufen, d. h. die depressiven Syndrome erfüllen nicht alle Kriterien einer Depression nach den internationalen Klassifikationssystemen. So kann das Gefühl von Traurigkeit oder gedrückter Stimmung fehlen und stattdessen Schmerzen, Gedächtnisstörungen, Wahn, Reizbarkeit, Agitiertheit oder Schlafstörungen dominieren. Insbesondere bei männlichen älteren Patienten sind Schlafstörungen und Wutausbrüche Indikatoren für eine Depression, die nicht auf die leichte Schulter genommen werden sollten, mahnte Wollmer. Das zeigt auch die hohe Suizidrate Älterer, die ab dem 65. Lebensjahr drastisch ansteigt.",

Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones. A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

      "title": "Estudio de los síntomas somáticos asociados a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una población de atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

Longitudinal studies of older adults with major depression report that a significant proportion of patients do not fully recover. Partial remission or symptoms of major depression that do not meet criteria for major depression, is predicted by 1) clinical factors, such higher number of symptoms at diagnosis, presence of comorbid dysthymia, and health problems; 2) social variables, such as high levels of perceived stress and low levels of perceived social support; and 3) perceived health/well-being variables, such as limitations in mobility or instrumental activities of daily living, poorer self-perceived health, finding life not satisfying, and looking back over life and finding it unhappy. Treatment options include antidepressants (alone or in combination) and psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Psychological Inflexibility in Depression with Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that can last for weeks or even months, in which there is a depressed mood accompanied by anxiety, in addition to negative changes in cognitive functions, psychomotor movement and vegetative functions. Depression with psychotic features is a psychiatric syndrome that progresses with delusions as well as severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation or agitation, depressive ruminations, deterioration in cognitive functions, and confusion. Compared to the subtypes without psychotic features, the symptoms are more severe, the age of onset is earlier, and the duration of the disease is longer. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide are more common. The risk of exacerbation is greater. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is more common in first-degree relatives of these patients. Objectives An 18-year-old female patient with somatic delusions and psychotic persistence that started after a sexual trauma and persisted for 1 month was consulted after organic exclusions were made. It is understood from the anamnesis that the patient had a manic episode about 6 months ago and that his mother was followed up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient’s current clinical picture was evaluated as depression with psychotic features, and after hospitalization, the treatment was adjusted as fluoxetine 20 mg/g, olanzapine 5 mg/g, and lithium 900 mg/g. Self as context, cognitive defusion and acceptance interventions were applied to the patient. Methods When the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire(CFQ), Self-as-Context Scale(SACS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire(AAQ-II) completed by the patient during hospitalization and in remission periods were compared, it was observed that there was a significant regression in the patient’s psychological inflexibility during the period of remission. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient whose clinical picture was presented in order to contribute to the scientific literature. Results Depression with psychotic features is another clinical picture in which psychological inflexibility increases, and it has been observed that interviews to increase psychological flexibility during the treatment process contribute positively to the treatment process. For this reason, the contribution to the healing process can be better clarified in further studies on interventions to increase psychological flexibility applied in addition to pharmacological treatments. Image: Conclusions Psychological inflexibility is an effort to control a person’s emotion, thought, behavior or experience in a dysfunctional way in the face of an undesired experience. It has been seen in studies conducted in recent years that; There is a significant positive correlation between high psychological inflexibility and somatization, depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders.

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

Patients with persistent somatization relentlessly seek medical diagnosis and treatment despite repeated reassurance that physical illness is either absent or insufficient to account for their symptoms and disability. Such abnormal illness behaviour leads to overuse of health care facilities and contributes to the high cost of health care.

Warning signsWhen symptoms are present for more than a month, cause diffi culties in functioning normally at a social, professional or other important level, or cause signifi cant suffering, it may be a PTSD.However, traumatic events do not cause PTSD in everyone who experiences them.Certain factors could lead to vulnerability to developing the disorder: having a biological fragility, having been the victim of physical or sexual abuse in the past, suffering from other mental health disorders [3], having had behavioral problems during childhood or adolescence or being subjected to chronic stressors.",

      "title": "Role of Social Support as a Mediator in Negative Stressful Life Event and Somatic Complaints of Managerial Personnel",
      "abstract": "In this Complex life scenario employees have to face different challenging task that either related to work or to day to day life situation, both of these causes some sort of problem to employees. Sometimes they express these problems in term of their bodily discomfort or simply somatic complaints. Somatic complaints are increasing day by day in this complex life scenario. Some of them are caused due to physical disturbances in the body while some of them are due to psychological stress that employees get from their life events. Somatic complaints like headache, abdominal pain, backache, insomnia, dizziness, and fatigue are common among employees (Aro, Paroncn, & Aro, 1987; Goodman & McGrath, 1991). Such complaints are inversely related to well-being (Millstein, 1993).Somatic complaints are reported either as in descriptive or subjective reports. Somatic complaints are a descriptive term that does not reflect any preassumptions about etiology. Somatic symptoms are subjective reports of physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or muscle pain. The expression of somatic complaints as a manifestation of social or psychological distress is recognized cross culturally (Escobar & Gureje, 2007; Murphy, 1989) but in low- and middle income countries (LAMICs) its evaluation is complicated by the high burden of undiagnosed disease and under nutrition, as well as by limited access to health services.It is also viewed that psychosomatic complaints are important indicators of psychosocial health (Piko, 2007) and well-being (Bemtsson, Kohler, & Gustafsson, 2001). By definition, they are subjective physical complaints (headache, stomachache, back ache, and dizziness) as well as psychological complaints (feeling low, irritability, nervousness, and difficulty in getting to sleep that are not caused by an underlying physical disease (Natvig, Albrektsen, Anderssen, & Qvamtstrom, 1999, p. 362).There are multiple socioemotional factors associated with reports of somatic symptoms (Garralda, 2010), including stress and reduced coping abilities (Walker et al., 2007). Children with chronic disease may have poor coping skills that may be related to somatic symptoms (Stewart et al., 2010).Findings indicate that somatic symptoms are associated with high levels of co-morbid psychological symptoms, like anxiety and depression (Haug, Mykletun, & Dahl, 2004), as well as high levels of functional impairment (Mulvaney, Lambert, Garber, & Walker, 2006; Aromaa, Sillanpaa, Rautava, & Helenius, 2000). Different theoretical approaches have dominated the research in understanding somatic symptomatology. Empirical support has been found for the idea that life events perceived as negative or stressful for individuals have the potential to produce somatic symptoms (Murberg, 2012).A stressful or traumatic life situation is one that generates challenges on which the organisms cannot completely respond. Life stress refers to the psychological response state of disturbed affect in relation to stressors in one's life as whole (Parasuram, Greenhouse, & Granrose, 1992). Life stress can result from specific major events or the cumulative effect of daily hassles (Rowdena, Matthewsb, Watsona, & Biggs, 2011). The life events tradition focuses on the global impact of life changes. It covers a wide range of events that either be positive or negative in nature. Research has shown that stressors are detrimental not only to indicators of psychological well-being, such as mood, but also to somatic complaints (Spector & Jex, 1998). Among others, the stress response is characterized by the activation of the sympatheticadrenal medullar system, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and catecholamine secretion. Over time, such reactions can result in the experience of somatic com-plaints, such as headache, back pain, and gastrointestinal problems.Social support is a significant feature of an individual's social environment and varying levels of support will be perceived as available to the individual in times of need (Snow, Swan, Raghavan, Connell, & Klein, 2003). …",

These symptoms may or may not be explained by a medical condition. The two major changes to the DSM-IV criteria included eliminating the requirement that somatic symptoms be organically unexplained and adding the requirement that certain psychobehavioral features have to be present to justify the diagnosis. The new criteria also eliminated somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, and pain disorder from the previous definitions.

In the modern world any person is subject to the influence of stress, regardless of the age and gender differences, culture and social status. Stress is a non-specific reaction of the body to the extreme impact of various factors - stressors. As stressors can be: emotional, social, physical, informational and other factors. In functional and morphological terms, stress is manifests itself as a general adaptation syndrome which mobilizes the body’s resources in order to maintain homeostasis. Stress is characterized by staging. The early period of stress is manifested by transient anxiety, with a decrease in body resistance – it is the first stage of the adaptation syndrome. The second stage of stress is characterized by the functional tension of the body’s systems and adaptation to new conditions. In the case of prolonged stress, the body’s reaction becomes pathological, with the depletion of adaptive reserves and the failure of protective mechanisms. At this stage is increase a vulnerability to any stressors. There is a further violation of the consistency of vital functions, and persistent anxiety is formed. In overwhelming majority of cases, stress-induced anxiety is develop of psychovegetative syndrome. In the case when combined the strategies of coping (it is the second stage of the reaction to stress - the stage of resistance) with stress and if it is interrupted at an early stage, in such a way the somatic symptoms are also interrupted at the stage of autonomic dystonia syndrome. When the persistent stress is, we have a development of the third stage – exhaustion. And against the background of limited adaptive reactions, there is a psychosomatic pathology. The above determines the need for early detection of psychovegetative syndrome and its timely treatment. The optimal choice is the appointment of combined drugs for stress, which have anti-anxiety, sedative and hypnotic effects. The combination of phenobarbital and ethylbromisovalerinate is one of the highly effective and widely used for the relief of stressinduced anxiety and manifestations of autonomic dysfunction, reducing the risk of developing psychosomatic pathology.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

Even in those patients with organic medical disorders, functional health status is strongly influenced by mood, coping skills, and social support, yet the predominant approach in medicine is to treat people with physical and chemical treatments that neglect the mental, emotional, and behavioral dimensions of illness. This critical mismatch between the psychosocial health needs of people and the usual medical response leads to frustration, ineffectiveness, and wasted health care resources. There is emerging evidence that empowering patients and addressing their psychosocial needs can be health and cost effective. By helping patients manage not just their disease but also common underlying needs for psychosocial support, coping skills, and sense of control, health outcomes can be significantly improved in a cost-effective manner. Rather than targeting specific diseases or behavioral risk factors, these psychosocial interventions may operate by influencing underlying, shared determinants of health such as attitudes, beliefs, and moods that predispose toward health in general. Although the health care system cannot be expected to address all the psychosocial needs of people, clinical interventions can be brought into alignment with the emerging evidence on shared psychosocial determinants of health by providing services that address psychosocial needs and improve adaptation to illness.",

However, some women experience severe physical and/or psychological symptoms before menstruation, which, if left untreated, can lead to a reduced quality of life. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) remain unclear. Despite the fact that PMS etiology remains unknown, there are some theories and studies supporting them that inappropriate inflammatory response and oxidative stress may be considered as the causes of occurrence of PMS. Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome can be nonspecific and individual for each specific woman, the diagnosis is made only on the basis of symptoms, pathognomonic hormonal disorders do not exist. Rarely, the symptoms are expressed to an extreme degree and disrupt the ability to work and the rhythm of a woman’s life, then premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) should be assumed, which is often underestimated, and the patient should be recommended to record her symptoms for ≥2 cycles. Usually, the treatment of premenstrual syndrome involves a combination of various methods in order to determine the most effective in each individual case: treatment includes lifestyle changes, micronutrient support, herbal medicine, pharmacotherapy. Drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives are first line for PMS and PMDD. Herbal medicines are used as maintenance therapy. Transdermal estradiol and cyclical gestogens in phase 2 of the menstrual cycle can be used as second line hormonal therapy.",

Un individuo che viene sottoposto per un breve periodo di tempo ad eventi stressanti, presentera quello che viene definito stress acuto, mentre se la durata dell’evento stressante permane per un lungo periodo di tempo, egli sara soggetto a stress cronico. Oltre alla distinzione dalla durata del tempo che un individuo e sottoposto a stress, si possono individuare due altre tipologie di stress basate sulla natura degli eventi stressanti. Si puo parlare di eustress quando gli stressor comportano conseguenze positive e dei veri e propri benefici che contribuiscono ad apportare una maggior vitalita dell’organismo. Anteposto all’eustress e il distress, caratterizzato da stressor negativi, nocivi per l’organismo. Quando il distress si presenta in maniera cronica, puo essere associato a numerosi disturbi e disfunzioni dell’organismo. Quando lo stress si presenta in maniera eccessiva e per un lungo periodo di tempo e necessario intervenire cosi da evitare delle conseguenze psicofisiche adottando delle strategie di coping, dei veri e propri meccanismi di difesa dallo stress cronico. Sono molteplici le ricerche effettuate per indagare quali strategie di coping sono piu ideali per prevenire o allentare lo stress e i correlati psicofisici che esso comporta.\r\n\r\nObiettivi\r\nGli obiettivi di questo lavoro di ricerca, oltre ad un approfondimento generale sul tema dello stress, ai suoi fattori scatenanti e ai rischi patologie correlate che esso include, e quello di individuare e valutare le strategie di coping piu efficaci che sono state e che vengono tutt’ora adottate da infermieri esperti clinici in salute mentale per allentare ed eliminare i sintomi dovuti allo stress assorbito sul proprio posto di lavoro. Lo sviluppo di tale lavoro si basa sull’analisi di sette articoli scientifici reperiti da diverse banche dati infermieristiche. Oltre a portare alla luce le differenti strategie di coping contro il distress cronico, sara mio compito scoprire e far emergere quali figure professionali possono contribuire e aiutare maggiormente gli individui che necessitano di queste strategie, in particolar modo cerchero di svelare il ruolo dell’infermiere in tale processo.\r\n\r\nMetodologia\r\nPer lo sviluppo di questo lavoro di tesi e stata utilizzata una metodologia di revisione della letteratura. Sono stati presi in considerazione sette articoli scientifici, accomunati da un indicatore temporale che va dal 2005 ad oggi. La stesura del lavoro e organizzata in quattro parti, nella prima parte vi e un’introduzione al lavoro con la motivazione della scelta. La seconda parte contiene il quadro teorico che supporta l’elaborazione della revisione. La terza parte presenta la revisione della letteratura, con i rispettivi risultate e la discussione. La quarta parte e composta dalle conclusioni del lavoro.\r\n\r\nRisultati\r\nDall’analisi dei sette articoli scientifici sono emerse nove efficaci strategie di coping, adottate da infermieri esperti clinici in salute mentale e psichiatria. Un ulteriore dato fondamentale che e emerso e che le strategie di coping adottate dagli infermieri in psichiatria rappresentano un campo ancora inesplorato, in quanto non vanta numerose evidenze scientifiche.",

A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

      "title": "Part III: Insomnia and Circadian Dysrhythmias",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is deﬁned as difﬁculty with the initiation, maintenance, duration, or quality of sleep resulting in the impairment of daytime functioning despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep (1,2). Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs) are reported to be among the most prevalent and unfavourable mental disorders in the individuals who have gone through life-threatening situations. For the late decades, they have been standing out against the background of marginal mental disorders. PTSDs are caused by an individual’s direct involvement in the stress event, fraught with grave consequences and accompanied by mortal fear, horror and sensation of powerlessness. The problem is pressing for the today’sUkrainein view of theDonbaswarfare, mass resettlement, changes of job and forms of activity. The disease may be diagnosed as PTSD in the case the groups of symptoms persist more than a month since a traumatic event has occurred. For a long time, a good many of soldiers have been reported to reveal anxiety-phobic and behavioural disorders, as well as the signs of organic cerebral lesion. Some of them occur during combat operations, whereas the most of symptoms develop and aggravate 1-2 years after coming home. The PTSD patients mostly develop insomnia, anxiety, depression, and increased aggressiveness, which cause conflicts. An individual may become wicked, aggressive, discontented and cynical on a social basis. Depressive symptoms are hypothesized to mediate the relationship between PTSD and aggression. The ATO men with PTSD, who do not take alcohol, develop depression 1-1.5 year after coming back and, with alcohol added, the problem of aggression arises. Based on this, we suggest that a staff of personnel, trained in psychological aid to the combatants with PTSD, should be formed. Besides, our cases prove that, with friendly support and compassion as well as active stand in life and adequate social work, aggression and proneness to conflict are unlikely to develop. On the contrary, lack of support results in excessive alcohol consumption and, thereof, increased proneness to conflict. The system of treatment and rehabilitation measures for survives should involve combination of psychotherapy, psychological correction, and medicines.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Einsamkeit wird zunehmend als bedeutendes Gesundheitsrisiko anerkannt. Diese Übersichtsarbeit fasst den aktuellen Stand der Forschung zusammen, indem sie die Auswirkungen von Einsamkeit auf die psychische und körperliche Gesundheit beleuchtet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Einsamkeit sowohl für die psychische als auch für die körperliche Gesundheit ein Risiko darstellt. Bisherige Übersichtsarbeiten zu den Auswirkungen auf die psychische Gesundheit zeigen, dass Einsamkeit insbesondere den Beginn einer Depression, einer sozialen Phobie und den Abbau kognitiver Funktionen vorhersagt. Außerdem kann Einsamkeit die Erholung von psychischen Störungen im Allgemeinen erschweren, was unter anderem auf den bidirektionalen Zusammenhang zwischen Einsamkeit und psychischer Gesundheit zurückgeführt werden kann. In Bezug auf körperliche Erkrankungen wurden bisher vor allem Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen als Folge von Einsamkeit untersucht. Einsamkeit sagt das Auftreten von Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen vorher und kann die Genesung von diesen erschweren. Übersichtsarbeiten zeigen zudem, dass Einsamkeit die Wahrscheinlichkeit für Suizidalität und Mortalität erhöht. Es wird jedoch auch auf den Mangel an Längsschnittstudien hingewiesen, der es erschwert, die kausale Wirkrichtung von Einsamkeit auf spätere Gesundheitseinschränkungen zu untersuchen. Die in dieser Übersichtsarbeit aufgezeigten gesundheitlichen Folgen von Einsamkeit, die teils irreversibel sind und Leiden sowie Beeinträchtigung verursachen können, unterstreichen die Bedeutung von Interventionen zur Reduzierung von Einsamkeit als präventive Maßnahme gegen sowohl psychische als auch körperliche Erkrankungen.",

However, many things that happen in our life can disrupt our emotional health. These can lead to strong feelings of sadness, stress, or anxiety. In today's world many things that happen in our life can disrupt our emotional health. Emotions are also associated with problematic changes in the cardiovascular, hormonal and immune system that may lead to allergies, headache, migraine, Arthritis, blood pressure, diabetes and may penetrate its way to the heart which gives you heart attacks. In fact, recent studies show, for over 40 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with depression, the number of people coping (or trying to cope) with loneliness is unknown, and that feeling of not belonging is depressing all by itself. Emotions like anger, fear, Disgust triggers strong sensations in the upper body. Other emotions like depression, sadness and shame shows diminished sensation in the lower body, while some emotions combined both type of response. Though emptions are created in the brain, they can be manifest as physical feelings throughout the body. The most common way to understand human emotion is by capturing and understand signals provided by the human body. With help of IoT, NLP, Machine learning, Social Analytics and Artificial Intelligence we can capture and understand physiological signals and develop an emotion recognition system based on information provided by physiological signals.",

Generalement, elles manifestent des reactions de stress depasse sous forme d’etat de choc ou d’agitation, voire de reactions mecaniques dont l’apparente normalite est souvent trompeuse. Ces reactions sont marquees par la detresse peri-traumatique et les symptomes dissociatifs. Les sujets predisposes peuvent declencher des troubles psychopathologiques nevrotiques (hysteriques, phobiques ou obsessionnels) ou des desordres psychotiques (trouble reactionnel post-traumatique, trouble psychotique bref, bouffees delirante ou autres affections psychotiques vraies). – Ces reactions disparaissent souvent au bout de quelques jours ou de quelques semaines. Cependant, certaines jeunes victimes voient leurs troubles persister et d’autres commencent a souffrir de symptomes prefigurant un syndrome psychotraumatique. D’autres encore vont inaugurer ou confirmer une psychopathologie nevrotique ou psychotique. – Generalement, chez les jeunes victimes, le syndrome post-traumatique apparait rapidement apres l’evenement critique.

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction often accompanies severe psychiatric illness and can be due to both the mental disorder itself and the use of psychotropic treatments. Many sexual symptoms resolve as the mental state improves, but treatment-related sexual adverse events tend to persist over time, and are unfortunately under-recognized by clinicians and scarcely investigated in clinical trials. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction adversely affects quality of life and may contribute to reduce treatment adherence. There are important differences between the various compounds in the incidence of adverse sexual effects, associated with differences in mechanisms of action. Antidepressants with a predominantly serotonergic activity, antipsychotics likely to induce hyperprolactinaemia, and mood stabilizers with hormonal effects are often linked to moderate or severe sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido, delayed orgasm, anorgasmia, and sexual arousal difficulties. Severe mental disorders can interfere with sexual function and satisfaction, while patients wish to preserve a previously satisfactory sexual activity. In many patients, a lack of intimate relationships and chronic deterioration in mental and physical health can be accompanied by either a poor sexual life or a more frequent risky sexual behaviour than in the general population. Here we describe the influence of psychosis and antipsychotic medications, of depression and antidepressant drugs, and of bipolar disorder and mood stabilizers on sexual health, and the optimal management of patients with severe psychiatric illness and sexual dysfunction.",

Extreme situations often produce hypnagogic states, like situations of war or near-death states or near coma states. Usually, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena are not indicative of dysfunctional or pathological processes. But when they last longer than usual, they may be indicative of a state where sleeping instead of being a container for the mind has turned into something scary or threatening. This is when sub-thalamic fears may appear. Primitive mental states usually follow these feelings and require a good deal of imagination to put all the split experiences together. The way the container functions is related to the initial experiences of life with the mother.",

Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

      "abstract": "Veel mensen in onze samenleving leiden aan regelmatige slaapproblemen of hebben gewoonweg niet voldoende tijd voor slaap. Wanneer slaapgebrek een chronisch probleem wordt zouden er wel eens veranderingen in hersenen en lichaam kunnen optreden die ernstige gevolgen hebben voor de psychische en fysieke gezondheid. Zo is er vaak gesuggereerd dat verstoorde slaap kan bijdragen aan het ontstaan van stemmingsstoornissen als depressie. In dit proefschrift worden studies beschreven naar de neurobiologische gevolgen van chronische slaaptekort in ratten. De dagelijkse hoeveelheid slaap werd tot minder dan de helft gereduceerd en in de weken daarna werden de gevolgen bestudeerd voor hersensystemen en hormonale processen die mogelijk betrokken zijn bij depressie. Hoewel een enkele dag van slaaptekort nog geen effecten had op deze systemen, waren er na een week al duidelijk veranderingen meetbaar in de gevoeligheid voor de neurotransmitter serotonine en in de regulatie van de hypofyse-bijnier as, het hormonale systeem dat betrokken is bij de reactie op stress. Na een maand van slaaptekort traden er zelfs morfologische veranderingen op in het brein. Er was een duidelijke afname in de grootte van de hippocampus, een hersengebied dat een belangrijke rol speelt bij de regulatie van emoties en cognitieve processen. Veel van de waargenomen neurobiologische en hormonale veranderingen na chronisch slaaptekort in ratten komen sterk overeen met afwijkingen die zijn vastgesteld bij depressieve patienten. De resultaten van deze studies leveren dan ook een sterke ondersteuning van de hypothese dat verstoorde slaap niet enkel een symptoom is van depressie maar, bij een deel van de patienten, mogelijk een causale rol speelt bij het ontstaan van de stemmingsstoornis.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

It is possible that the temporal overlapping of a constellation of factors may act as favouring and/or triggering factors for the onset of several acute diseases. Among these, epistaxis shows a circadian variability too. Such pattern, characterised by a prevalent peak in the morning and a secondary one in the evening, strictly resembles that of arterial blood pressure. The lack of differences between the temporal pattern of hypertensive and normotensive subjects suggests that the physiological pattern of blood pressure, and not strictly a condition of hypertension, may play a favouring role in certain hours of the day, probably together other local factors.",

      "title": "Functional limitations associated with mental disorders : inescapable fact or avoidable reality?",
      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

Sadness isn't a passing blue temperament, which nearly everybody encounters from time to time, but a complex mind/body sickness that meddling with ordinary working. It not as it were obscures one's viewpoint, it is commonly checked by rest issues and changes in vitality levels and craving. It changes the structure and work of nerve cells so that it disturbs the way the brain forms data and deciphers involvement. In spite of sentiments of sadness and worthlessness, depression could be a treatable condition. It can be treated with psychotherapy or medicine, or a combination of both. Depression is a common condition in modern life. According to the National Institutes of Health, each year more than 16 million adults in the United States experience at least one episode of major depression. The likelihood that a person will develop depression at some point in life is approximately 10 percent. Prolonged social stress and major disruption of social ties are known risk factors for depression, and major negative life events such as loss of a loved one, or loss of a job, increase the subsequent risk of depression. Significant adversity early in life, such as separation from parents or parental neglect or abuse, may create vulnerability to major depression later in life by setting the nervous system to over-respond to stress.",

      "abstract": "The mind and the heart are inextricably linked. Depression, worry, loneliness, anger, and chronic stress are all negative mental states that can increase the risk of heart disease or worsen existing cardiac problems. Cardiomyopathy develops in response to suddenly hearing stressful news, such as a loved one diagnosed with cancer. Thus, intense emotions, such as anger, can also lead to abnormal heart rhythms. When you are stressed, your blood pressure and heart rate both rise. Chronic stress causes your body to produce harmful quantities of stress hormones such as cortisol, which can alter blood clots. All of these factors can lead to a heart attack or a stroke. Negative thoughts, feelings, or emotions may influence lifestyle patterns, increasing the risk of heart disease. People who are chronically stressed, nervous, sad, or angry are more likely to consume excessive amounts of alcohol, smoke, overeat, and exercise insufficiently– all harmful habits that are detrimental to their heart health.",

      "abstract": "Stress and anxiety are necessary in life to a small extent and sometimes improve people’s performance, but sometimes and in situations such as today, when the disease is prevalent all over the world, this stress is higher than usual and it causes man problems that must be controlled. When this stress, worry, fear, and anxiety intensifies and persists, it becomes abnormal and morbid and causes a variety of reactions, including physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions. Physical reactions to stress include increased heart rate, sweating, dry mouth, tremors, dizziness, shortness of breath, headache and muscle aches, irritability, fatigue, upset stomach, frequent urination, decreased energy, tiredness, sleep problems, It is a change in appetite and so on.1,2 The cognitive component includes thoughts and beliefs about the person being injured or losing control of the situation. Thus, stress leads to a decrease in the ability to think, a decrease in the ability to pay attention and focus, problems related to memory and recall, magnification and catastrophizing problems, and so on. Emotional reactions include fear, worry, sadness, loss of interest in normal pleasurable activities, feelings of frustration, irritability, anger, feelings of helplessness, and so on. Behavioral reactions include avoid\u0002ing certain situations, asking frequently asked questions about how things are going, constantly looking for common sense, blaming others, spreading rumors, dependence on alcohol and drugs, and so on.2,3 In the current situation, the corona virus is a concern and needs attention and care, especially when we feel threatened and do not have the necessary ability to deal with it, it is natural to experience anxiety, worry, anxiety and fear. There are several reasons for this stress, including the speed with which the disease spreads from epidemic to pandemic; Unawareness and complete lack of knowledge of this virus in terms of its signs and symptoms; Methods of transmission, methods of prevention and primary care, duration of the disease, methods of treatment and its consequences, the existence of contradictory information, infodemias or statistics and unreliable information and its magnification through social networks, etc. have caused stress, Fear and worry about this disease becomes much more than the disease itself.3-5",

      "title": "Somatisation as a manifestation of emotional disturbance in children",
      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

      "title": "What Are Nurses Doing to Help PMS Patients?",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a hot topic these days but the disorder remains an enigma. Many women suffer, to some degree, the cyclic signs of PMS-irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired concentration, breast swelling and tenderness, headache, binge eating and/or craving for sweet or salty foods. But why? Is the cause hormonal and/or biochemical imbalance, poor nutrition, underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other unknown factor(1-3)? syndrome is defined as a complex of symptoms-somatic, behavioral, and emotional-occurring in the luteal phase. This phase usually begins in midcycle with ovulation, when the follicle is changed into corpus luteum, and ends at (or shortly after) menstruation(l). In many ways, PMS mimics dysmenorrhea; the key differences are in the timing of symptoms and in pelvic cramping. Although headache, nausea, edema, and fatigue are common to both, pelvic cramping is specific to, and the principal sign of, dysmenorrhea, which generally begins a day or two before menses and peaks in severity on the first or second day of flow. PMS has a wider variety of symptoms (150 having been identified in the literature)(4). syndrome also begins earlier in the cycle than does dysmenorrhea, and PMS is abruptly relieved at menses. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of women of childbearing age suffer some premenstrual symptoms. However, it is also believed that only 5 to 15 percent have very severe symptoms(5). Many theories have been proposed on specific etiology. An estrogen/progesterone imbalance, excessive prostaglandins, abnormal magnesium metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, reactive hypoglycemia, and neuroendocrine changes in the hypothalmic-pituitary axis are among them, but no theory has been conclusively proved(1-8). Theories on effective treatment also abound. AJN asked nurses, physicians, and researchers involved in the treatment and study of PMS what methods they used, and to what effect. It became clear that nurses are playing the key role in the management of patients with PMS, and that they can back up their advice on methods with solid evidence. Michelle Harrison, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, author of Self-Help for Premenstrual Syndrome, advises physicians that nurses are ideally qualified to handle patients with PMS(9). Guy E. Abraham, a California PMS specialist known for significant research on nutritional and vitamin treatment for the disorder, agrees: The in PMS treatment is that the patient has most of her contact with a nurse. Total nurse management is not unusual, unless a medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible disease. predominant model might describe Mary Ann Wilson, RN, C, a nurse practitioner who has seen over 100 PMS patients in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in East Hartford, Connecticut. department is staffed by five nurse practitioners, four physicians, and two RNs who do phone follow-up. Wilson says PMS patients are referred to the nurse practitioners. We do all the screening and counseling, unless a medical problem is indicated, or the patient requests an MD, she reports. initial PMS consult is scheduled during the patient's asymptomatic follicular phase (which runs from menses to ovulation), Wilson explained, since a PMS patient is then under less stress and she'll have much more energy to do what you suggest. Some women, says Wilson, will first call during an emergency. We'll do a 'validating' visit; we will talk and calm them and advise a visit when they don't feel so bad. If the patient seems in crisis, particularly if she is suicidal, we will send her immediately to the mental health department for counseling. Most HMO patients have had a thorough physical within six to 12 months of seeking help for PMS. nurse reviews the patient's chart for health problems that could be contributing to, or confused with, PMS. A nutritional history is taken, with particular attention to excessive alcohol, salt, and caffeine intake.

Estos pacientes suelen recibir un diagnóstico clínico de “trastorno de la personalidad”, pero probablemente sea más apropiado describirlos como pacientes “multiproblemáticos” debido a los déficits ampliamente extendidos en su funcionamiento cognitivo, emocional, conductual y social. Estos pacientes suelen experimentar estados emocionales negativos crónicos, como depresión, ansiedad, apatía, aburrimiento, soledad, culpa e ira. Este afectividad alterada es el principal impulsor de una plétora de respuestas de afrontamiento desadaptativas: las principales son la conducta suicida repetitiva y las conductas adictivas como el abuso de alcohol/drogas, los trastornos alimentarios y/o la automutilación crónica. Los pacientes multiproblemáticos también experimentan importantes déficits en el funcionamiento social e interpersonal. Tienen problemas para formar y mantener relaciones interpersonales y a menudo introducen en el proceso terapéutico un conjunto de cuestiones conflictivas en torno a la formación y el mantenimiento de relaciones adultas, tanto superficiales como íntimas. La cantidad y la magnitud de estos problemas conductuales, cognitivos y emocionales son una fuente de frustración para los terapeutas...",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

      "abstract": "The reporting of physical symptoms is influenced to a large degree by psychological processes. Individuals are more likely to notice subtle sensations in environments lacking in stimulation than those demanding external attention. The beliefs or schemas that people hold dictate where and how they attend to their bodies as well. These normal perceptual processes help explain why people are often poor at accurately detecting internal physiological activity. Several individual differences are also related to the symptom reporting process. Females are more likely to base their symptom reports on external situational cues than are males. In addition, individuals with chronic anxiety--those high in Negative Affectivity (NA)--report more symptoms than those low in NA. Finally, individuals, who have had traumatic experiences, either in childhood or within 1-6 months prior to a major symptom reporting episode, tend to be high symptom reporters. Several recommendations are made to help researchers and clinicians distinguish between psychological or perceptual factors with presumed biological effects. One implication of this work is that MCS and allied syndromes should be viewed as both a mental and a physical health problem.",

Los sintomas pueden afectar a diversos ambitos psicologicos, pudiendose agrupar en sintomas positivos (delirios y alucinaciones, principalmente), sintomas negativos (pensamiento empobrecido, alogia, deficit volitivo), sintomas afectivos (afecto aplanado, inadecuado; ahedonia, apatia) y sintomas cognitivos (deficits neurocognitivos, estrechamente vinculados al resultado funcional de los pacientes). En general, se acepta clasicamente que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia en la poblacion general es del 1%. Las cifras de prevalencia anual en el ano 1998, recopiladas por varios registros correspondientes a distintas provincias espanolas, coinciden con los valores asumidos de prevalencia mundial, que oscilan aproximadamente entre el 2 y el 4,5 por 1.000 habitantes4. Segun un estudio realizado en Cantabria por Vazquez-Barquero (1995), la incidencia aumenta hasta el 19 por 100.000 (18,8 para los varones y 19,3 para las mujeres) en la poblacion en situacion de riesgo (definida por los autores como aquella con edades comprendidas entre los 15 y los 54 anos)4. Segun las guias clinicas publicadas por la APA2, los objetivos del tratamiento de la fase de agudizacion psicotica interesan de manera primordial a los sintomas positivos: evitar que el paciente sufra lesiones, controlar las alteraciones del comportamiento, disminuir la gravedad de la psicosis y de sus sintomas asociados (delirios, alucinaciones, agitacion, agresividad, angustia) e identificar y analizar los factores desencadenantes del episodio agudo. Se trata ademas de recuperar con rapidez el mejor nivel de funcionamiento, establecer una alianza terapeutica con el paciente y su familia, formular planes de tratamiento a corto y a largo plazo y poner al paciente en contacto con los correspondientes servicios de asistencia ambulatoria. Vale decir que el tratamiento farmacologico instaurado para el manejo y control de estas fases agudas puede determinar el tratamiento de mantenimiento durante los periodos de compensacion clinica, por lo que la eficacia sobre sintomas negativos-afectivos-cognitivos debe ser tenida en cuenta en la eleccion terapeutica, entendiendo asi el abordaje integral de las diferentes fases y problematicas de la esquizofrenia. Durante la fase de estabilizacion, el objetivo principal del tratamiento, ademas del mantenimiento de la compensacion clinica, debe centrarse en continuar el proceso de recuperacion y lograr un mejor funcionamiento y calidad de vida2, y por ello la gran importancia de una buena vinculacion a dispositivos comunitarios, terapias rehabilitadoras, trabajo con las familias, etc. Ademas, en los pacientes que han sufrido dos o mas episodios en los ultimos 5 anos, se recomienda la administracion de medicacion antipsicotica de mantenimiento durante un tiempo indefinido2. En este sentido, los tratamientos antipsicoticos deben sumar a su eficacia un bajo perfil de efectos adversos (tolerancia), ya que cuanto menor sea la presencia de efectos indeseables, mayor sera igualmente la aceptacion subjetiva por el paciente de los farmacos prescritos, factor importante para aumentar la adherencia terapeutica (el 60-70% de los pacientes sin tratamiento de mantenimiento sufre una recaida antes de 1 ano, y este porcentaje aumenta hasta practicamente el 90% en los 2 anos siguientes2).",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

The compulsions (repetitive behaviours) include excessive cleaning and/or handwashing, arranging things in a symmetrical or in a perfect order, repeatedly checking on things and compulsive counting. Both obsessional thoughts and compulsion behaviours make an individual dysfunctional and significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions.

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "title": "ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE INTEGRATED CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN",
      "abstract": "In the holistic approach in medicine а person is viewed through the bio-psycho-social model. Human health is a trinity of “soma” (body), “psyche” (soul) and social role (position) that are constantly interacting with each other and with the environment. Any action on one of the dimensions inevitably affects the others. Chronic non-communicable diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. They cause social, economic and psychological burden for individuals, their families and the whole society. Much of the socially significant diseases (especially cancer and degenerative diseases) are associated with chronic pain. Epidemiological data shows that between 10.1% and 55.2% of people in different countries suffer from chronic pain. Pain has been shown to affect all dimensions of health related to quality of life. Patients with chronic pain also suffer from depression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Limitation of physical activity leads to overweight and all additional health risks related to this condition. Depression, inability to work, impaired social contacts and suicidal thoughts make chronic pain a public health problem. Drug medication along with psychological support and social commitment are important elements of holistic integrated care for patients with chronic pain.The purpose of this article is to analyze the ethical considerations of integrative care for patients with chronic pain.In modern medical ethics autonomy is basic principle. In bioethics autonomy means “the capacity to make an informed, uncoerced decision for your health”. To participate in the decision-making process patients, need sufficient and comprehensive information. The right to information is a basic patient’s right and obligation of the physician. The partnership model is of great importance in the treatment of chronic diseases. The patient is engaged as part of the therapeutic team, actively participates in the healing process and implements self-management of the disease. Numerous studies have proven that patient involvement improves medical outcomes and cost-effectiveness in healthcare. The communication between the doctor and the patient is a cornerstone and a premise for quality medical care.In conclusion, in the age of high-tech medicine, the human factor and patient-centered care have remained intact. Good awareness of patients is of key importance for their participation in the treatment. Easily available, true and relevant information is a prerequisite for understanding the pain control options.",

      "abstract": "Das Reizdarmsyndrom (RDS) zahlt zu den funktionellen gastrointestinalen Storungen (FGIS), welche in den letzten Jahrzehnten intensiv beforscht wurden. Bei dieser sehr haufigen Diagnose in der Gastroenterologie ist das Zusammenwirken somatischer, psychischer und sozialer Komponenten bei der Entstehung und im Verlauf des Beschwerdebildes besonders zu beachten. Typisch fur das RDS sind abdominelle Beschwerden, Stuhlunregelmasigkeiten, sowie das Fehlen von organpathologischen Befunden, die die Beschwerden ausreichend erklaren konnten. Viele Betroffene suchen wiederholt Hilfe bei gastroenterologischen Spezialisten oder Institutionen. Da dieses Beschwerdebild sehr beeintrachtigend und fur einen Teil der Betroffenen auch sehr beangstigend ist, weisen diese auch haufiger (in Spezialzentren uber 60 %) psychische Storungen auf. Der Anteil von PatientInnen mit irgendeiner Form von psychischer Stressbelastung oder Traumatisierung (psychisch, physisch oder sexuell) in der Anamnese ist groser als bei anderen „organischen“ Erkrankungen. Wenn die Beschwerden nicht ausreichend erklart und behandelt werden, fuhrt dies haufig zur Erhohung des Leidensdrucks und zu einer weiteren „Hilfesuche“ bei den Betroffenen. Dies hat auch gesundheitsokonomische Konsequenzen mit Kostensteigerungen. Die Integration psychosozialer Faktoren im diagnostischen Prozess und eine psychosomatische Betreuung der RDS-PatientInnen sind daher besonders wichtig. Stichworter: Reizdarmsyndrom, viszerale Hypersensitivitat, Psychosomatik, Hirn-Darm-Achse, bauchgerichtete Hypnosetherapie. The Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is part of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), which were studied intensively within the last decades. In this very frequent diagnosis in Gastroenterology the interaction of somatic, psychic and social components in aetiology and the course of the illness should be especially considered. Typical symptoms in IBS are abdominal complaints, irregular bowel movements and lack of pathological findings, which could explain sufficiently the symptoms. Many patients seek repeatedly help from gastroenterological specialists and institutions. Since the illness is very impairing, and for some also terrifying, these patients show more frequent psychological disturbances (in tertiary centres more than 60 %). The proportion of patients with any kind of stress or abuse (psychological, physical or sexual) in their history is greater in IBS than in other “organic” diseases. If the symptoms are not sufficiently explained and / or treated, the suffering and health care seeking of IBS patients leads to health-economic consequences with increasing costs. Therefore the integration of psychosocial factors in the diagnostic process and the psychosomatic care of patients with IBS are very important.",

Psychiatric emergencies can have a variety of presentations and occur in a variety of settings:. A psychiatric emergency can be conceptualized under following broad categories: Acute onset of illness in a person with no past background of a psychiatric illness Acute exacerbation of a chronic psychiatric illness or an acute relapse in a psychiatric illness of recurring nature Psychiatric symptoms resulting from an underlying medical illness or use of a psychoactive substance or prescription drug. Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death. Others include:- Delirium Tremens, Psychiatric Emergencies in Disaster Survivors, Rape and Sexual Abuse etc.",

      "title": "Symptoms, Symptom Management, and Psychological Morbidity Among Persons with HIV Disease",
      "abstract": "For the clinician caring for patients in some phase of symptomatic HIV disease, patients' current level of adaptation and potential to sustain a sense of well-being are critical. Symptoms of anxiety and depression raise concern, and must be assessed for their severity and enduring qualities. Are these expressions evidence of moods that fluctuate over time even within a given day? Or are they reflective of full-blown syndromes enduring over time? Finally, are these reported and observable symptoms signs of current or imminent psychiatric disorders? Too frequently, episodes of anxiety and depression in persons with life-threatening illness are misdiagnosed where transient moods are given clinical relevance and syndromes are underestimated. Specificity in assessment is needed to derive the most appropriate intervention program. This problem in the context of primary care services to persons with HIV illness can lead to too much concern about temporary distress and minimization of moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression. People with AIDS (PWAs) must cope with multiple complications while anticipating a shortened lifespan. Emotional distress is common and may be organically based, idiopathic, and/or reactive. The relationship of somatic well-being and subjective emotional distress needs attention since the severity of physical debilitation and heightened risk of psychological problems seem to be correlated in this population. Predicting increased anxiety and dysphoric moods at crisis points in the illness draws attention to the role of individuals' cognitive appraisals of their symptoms, judgments of self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies. Symptom severity and perceived control over symptoms are interlocking phenomena capable of influencing emotional distress in these patients.",

The onset of dementia can be abrupt, maximal, and static, e.g., following cardiac arrest or severe head trauma, or progressive such as occurs in the degenerative diseases of aging. Of the two forms the progressive types of dementia create by far the more frequent problem and, reflecting the increased longevity of the population, have become one of the major public health concerns of the Western world. Over 6% of adults aged over 65 years and 20% over the age of 80 are estimated to suffer from a medically or socially disabling degree of dementia.",

Existential distress is more specifically defined as that distress which arises from confrontation with the essence of existence—the issues of death, the meaning of life, aloneness, responsibility, freedom, choices, and a sense of personal worth. There are many potential causes of transient distress in palliative care, including insensitive comments, long waits in clinical departments, and disease symptoms. Such potential causes of distress should be an important focus of attention in everyday nursing practice, because the disruption and worry they cause is often unnecessary. The wish to continue living is a potent life force that is present in most people until the moment of death, and fear of death grows as death approaches. Antianxiety medication with long-acting benzodiazepines or antidepressants can also be helpful for very distressed people. Many nurses also feel they have little time to assess and address people's concerns comprehensively.",

Darüber hinaus ist Einsamkeit ein Phänomen, welches im klinischen Alltag häufig anzutreffen ist, auch wenn es von Patientinnen und Patienten nicht immer spontan berichtet wird. Das aversive Gefühl der Einsamkeit tritt auf, wenn unser menschliches Grundbedürfnis nach sozialen Beziehungen nicht genügend befriedigt ist. Es zeigt sich bei Betroffenen, die über zu wenige oder qualitativ nicht ausreichend befriedigende Kontakte verfügen. Es ist wichtig, zwischen vorübergehender, situativer und überdauernder Einsamkeit zu unterscheiden. Denn obwohl jede Art von Einsamkeit schmerzhaft ist, ist Einsamkeit nicht immer dysfunktional. Während vorübergehenden und situativ bedingten Einsamkeitsgefühlen in der Regel eine adaptive Funktion zugeschrieben wird, sind überdauernde Einsamkeitsgefühle mit einem hohen Leidensdruck und einer Vielzahl von psychischen und somatischen Beschwerden assoziiert. Überdauernde Einsamkeitsgefühle spielen bei der Entstehung und/oder Aufrechterhaltung verschiedener psychischer Störungen eine zentrale Rolle. Der Band sensibilisiert Fachpersonen für das Thema Einsamkeit, fasst den aktuellen Stand zur Phänomenologie und Verbreitung von Einsamkeit zusammen und nennt verschiedene Risikofaktoren für die Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung von Einsamkeit. Zudem werden empirische Zusammenhänge von Einsamkeit mit psychischen und somatischen Störungen sowie klinischen Phänomenen wie Suizidalität berichtet. Der Band stellt verschiedene Erklärungsmodelle vor und beschreibt spezifische, darauf aufbauende Interventionsmöglichkeiten. Diese sollen Fachpersonen beim Umgang mit dem Thema Einsamkeit in der Therapie unterstützen und eine auf die individuellen Umstände einer Person abgestimmte Therapie ermöglichen.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: How to Alleviate Her Suffering; Accurate Diagnosis, Tailored Treatments Can Greatly Improve Women's Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "Approximately 75% of women experience a premenstrual change in emotional or physical symptoms commonly referred to as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These symptoms--including increased irritability, tension, depressed mood, and somatic complaints such as breast tenderness and bloating--often are mild to moderate and cause minimal distress. (1) However, approximately 3% to 9% of women experience moderate to severe premenstrual mood symptoms that meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] PMDD includes depressed or labile mood, anxiety, irritability, anger, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and other symptoms that occur exclusively during the 2 weeks before menses and cause significant deterioration in daily functioning. Women with PMDD use general and mental health services more often than women without the condition. (3) They may experience impairment in marital and parental relationships as severe as that experienced by women with recurrent or chronic major depression. (2) PMDD often responds to treatment. Unfortunately, many women with PMDD do not seek treatment, and to 90% may go undiagnosed.4 In this article, we review the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PMDD. A complex disorder A distinguishing characteristic of PMDD is the timing of symptom onset. In women with PMDD, mood symptoms occur only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (ovulation until onset of menses) and resolve after menstruation onset. Women with PMDD report normal mood and functioning during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (first day of the menstrual cycle until ovulation). Although PMS and PMDD criteria share affective and somatic symptoms, more symptoms are required for a PMDD diagnosis, and symptoms often are more severe. (5) As defined in DSM-IV-TR (Table), (6) PMDD has a broader range of symptoms than PMS and includes symptoms not included in the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria for PMS, (7) such as impaired concentration, appetite, and sleep (hypersomnia or insomnia); and mood lability. PMDD symptoms must occur only during the 2 weeks preceding menses, although average symptoms last 6 days and severity usually peaks in the 2 days before menses. (1) The prevalence of subthreshold PMDD is fairly common; approximately 19% of women will meet some--but not all--DSM-IV-TR criteria for PMDD. (3) In a revision proposed for DSM-5, PMDD would be included as a mood disorder, which represents a significant change from DSM-IV-TR, where it is listed in the appendix as criteria. (8) In addition, in oral contraceptive users, a PMDD diagnosis should not be made unless the premenstrual symptoms are reported to be present and as severe when the woman is not taking the oral contraceptive. (8) DSM-IV-TR research criteria for PMDD A. In most menstrual cycles of the past year, [greater than or equal to] 5 of the following symptoms must be present for most of the time during the last week of the luteal phase, begin to remit within a few days after the onset of the follicular phase, and are absent in the week postmenses, with [greater than or equal to] 1 of the symptoms being either 1, 2, 3, or 4: 1. Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopeless, or self-deprecating thoughts 2. Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being keyed up or on edge 3. Marked affectivity lability 4. Persistent and marked anger or irritability or increased interpersonal conflicts 5. Decreased interest in usual activities 6. Subjective sense of difficulty concentrating 7. Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy 8. Marked changes in appetite, overeating, or specific food cravings 9. Hypersomnia or insomnia 10.

In volunteer subjects, they have been known to produce a variety of intense and unusual psychic effects. These include bizarre visual phenomena, ranging from a heightening of the apparent brightness or beauty of colored objects in the environment, through distortions in the perceived nature or meaning of real objects (illusions) to true visual hallucinations of colors, shapes, or even of complex scenes or events. These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions. Subjects describe changes in body image, the body or its parts appearing larger or smaller, intense feelings of depersonalization, including states in which the subject believes he is",

      "title": "Investigation des fonctions mnésiques impliquées dans le processus de rémission de l'état de stress post-traumatique",
      "abstract": "L'etude de l'etat de stress post-traumatique (ESPT) amene a se poser deux types de questions fondamentales : 1) pourquoi certains individus exposes a un evenement traumatique developpent le trouble alors que d'autres non? et 2) parmi ceux qui developpent le trouble, pourquoi la majorite des individus entrent en remission apres quelques mois alors que d'autres developpent un ESPT chronique qui persiste pendant plusieurs mois, voire plusieurs annees? La presente these avait donc pour but de trouver certaines explications a cette deuxieme question qui semble plus importante d'un point de vue clinique en raison des repercussions que ce trouble peut avoir sur le fonctionnement quotidien des victimes et de leur entourage. Effectivement, pour certaines victimes, plus le temps passe, plus les symptomes s'installent et se cristallisent. Pour ces individus, les symptomes chroniques et dommageables seraient souvent jumeles a differentes complications, notamment un trouble depressif ou anxieux, un trouble de dependance ou d'abus de substances, un changement au niveau de la personnalite, ainsi qu'a une degradation durable au plan du fonctionnement social et professionnel (Ehlers & Clark, 2000). Il a ete propose que le processus de remission ne requiert pas un oubli, mais reflete plutot un nouvel apprentissage (Foa, 2000) et que les dysfonctions mnesiques (souvenirs recurrents et involontaires du trauma et difficultes a se souvenirs du trauma) observees chez les victimes d'evenements traumatiques pourraient interferer avec la remission du trauma, un processus d'adaptation qui requiert ce nouvel apprentissage par extinction (Shalev, 2000). La these se compose de quatre chapitres. Le premier consiste en une description des modeles theoriques et neuronaux ainsi qu'une recension de la litterature sur les processus mnesiques impliques dans l'ESPT ainsi que les facteurs neurobiologiques sous-jacents aux dysfonctions mnesiques retrouvees dans l'ESPT. Cette recension met en evidence la controverse dans la litterature en ce qui a trait a la memoire traumatique ainsi que les principales failles methodologiques qui empechent de repondre au questionnement souleve. Le deuxieme chapitre presente une etude qui avait pour but d'examiner, de facon longitudinale, la fidelite des souvenirs retrospectifs des experiences emotionnelles peritraumatiques (detresse et dissociation vecues au moment du trauma) chez des individus exposes a un evenement traumatique en fonction de leur statut diagnostic. Il etait anticipe qu'en appliquant la theorie d'une relation en « U » inversee entre l'intensite du stress et le systeme mnesique hippocampique (Metcalfe & Jacobs, 1998) et en tenant compte du statut diagnostique, nous pourrions mieux comprendre les resultats contradictoires obtenus jusqu'a maintenant au sujet des souvenirs traumatiques. Les resultats de cette etude ont demontre que le statut diagnostique est associe a la fidelite des souvenirs retrospectifs des reponses peritraumatiques. Ces resultats sont donc en accord avec la theorie de Metcalfe & Jacob (1998) sur la memoire traumatique humaine qui suggere qu'un niveau de stress modere produit un souvenir forme a l'aide de l'hippocampe et est associe avec la memoire episodique, autobiographique et contextuelle, alors qu'un niveau de stress extreme mene a un encodage independant de l'hippocampe, mais associe a l'activation de l'amygdale, menant a la creation d'un souvenir decontextualise, sensoriel et charge emotionnellement. Le troisieme chapitre presente une deuxieme etude qui avait pour but d'examiner, de facon longitudinale, le role des facteurs neurobiologiques sous-jacents aux fonctions mnesiques dans l'evolution des symptomes d'ESPT en etudiant l'implication de certains SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphism) du gene FKBP5 dans le processus de remission du trouble. Les resultats ont demontre que le gene FKBP5 pouvait prospectivement predire le manque d'amelioration des symptomes d'ESPT chez des individus ayant recours a une therapie pour un ESPT aigu. Des analyses plus specifiques ont aussi demontre un effet interactif des SNPs du gene FKBP5 et du souvenir subjectif de la severite du trauma (c.-a-d., les reponses peritraumatiques) sur les dysfonctions mnesiques. Les resultats demontrent donc une relation entre les corticosteroides et les performances mnesiques, ce qui pourrait interferer avec l'apprentissage par extinction, et par consequent, en partie expliquer la persistance du trouble. Le dernier chapitre propose une discussion generale des resultats qui permettent de constater que les processus mnesiques sont impliques dans la remission/persistance de l'ESPT. Les differentes forces et limites ainsi que les implications cliniques et theoriques de la presente these sont aussi examinees.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________",

      "abstract": "Many GPs find the care of patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) challenging. Therefore, the WONCA Working Party for Primary Mental Health asked for MUS guidance for family doctors worldwide in order to improve the care of patients with MUS globally. This article is a summary of this guidance.\n\nMUS are physical symptoms that have existed for several weeks and for which adequate medical examination or investigation have not revealed any condition that sufficiently explains the symptoms. MUS is a working hypothesis based on the (justified) assumption that somatic or psychiatric pathology have been adequately detected and treated, but that the clinical condition presented by the patients was not adequately resolved. Any change in symptoms could be a reason to revise the working hypothesis of MUS.1 For some patients with physical symptoms, a somatic or psychiatric condition may be present. However, if the physical symptoms are more severe or more persistent, or limit functioning to a greater extent than expected based on the condition in question, they too are referred to as MUS.\n\nMUS can be seen as a continuum ranging from self-limiting symptoms to recurrent and/or persisting symptoms and symptom disorders. The group with recurrent and/or persisting symptoms is especially relevant in primary care as these …",

      "title": "O PAPEL DO TRATAMENTO FARMACOLÓGICO E NÃO FARMACOLÓGICO NA REDUÇÃO DE RECIDIVA NO TRANSTORNO DE ANSIEDADE GENERALIZADA",
      "abstract": "Introdução: O transtorno de ansiedade generalizada difere da ansiedade normal visto que além da preocupação excessiva, invasiva e de difícil controle, está diretamente relacionada a sofrimento e prejuízo significativo. Com isso pessoas acometidas com TAG apresentam uma perda de desempenho considerável em vários setores da vida, causando uma situação severa de autocobrança o que piora o quadro do paciente e culmina em significante diminuição da qualidade de vida. Esse excesso de ansiedade promove uma exaustão no organismo, e com isso o surgimento dos sintomas, e a persistência dessa exaustão pode desencadear ao longo da vida outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Com o crescimento exponencial do número de pessoas acometidas por preocupações excessivas, sem o controle para parar de se preocupar, mesmo que por pouco tempo, e as repercussões negativas que isso acarreta a saúde, se faz importante um acompanhamento desse paciente para alívio desses sintomas assim como evitar recidivas. Objetivo: Busca-se identificar os reais benefícios da associação do tratamento farmacológico e não farmacológico na TAG. Métodos: Trata-se de um trabalho realizado por meio de uma revisão bibliográfica integrativa, foi utilizado como fonte de busca dos dados eletrônicos o PubMed Central®️ (PMC), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) e Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS), sendo selecionados os descritores em inglês (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Pharmacological Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) e português (Transtorno de Ansiedade Generalizada, Tratamento Farmacológico, Terapia Cognitivo Comportamental,). Os artigos incluídos serão aqueles publicados na íntegra, disponíveis eletronicamente, em inglês ou português; realizados com seres humanos e que abordem a temática selecionada. Serão excluídos: editoriais; cartas ao editor; dissertações; teses; livros; relatos de experiência; estudos que não abordem a TAG e suas abordagens terapêuticas e trabalhos com menores de 18 anos. Resultados Esperados: Espera-se com esta pesquisa, trazer informações na literatura que proponham as melhores estratégias de adesão ao tratamento não farmacológico por parte dos pacientes com transtorno de ansiedade generalizada, assim como avaliar os reais benefícios da associação dos tratamentos farmacológicos e não farmacológicos no transtorno de ansiedade generalizada e o reflexo na redução de recidivas. Conclusão: Em síntese, o Transtorno de Ansiedade Generalizada faz parte de um grupo de doenças psiquiátricas, sendo assim, a saúde mental é tão importante quanto a saúde física e o tratamento farmacológico ou não farmacológico é fundamental para a redução da recidiva do TAG, ocorrendo a escolha do tratamento de acordo com a necessidade de cada indivíduo.

      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "The problem of drug abuse and addiction is one of the most complex problems that affects all countries worldwide, due to the serious damage it can cause to various health, psychological, social, economic and security aspects. All countries strive to fight it by any means necessary. The World Health Organization defines addiction as the compulsive desire to continue using or obtaining a substance by any means, with a tendency to increase the dose taken. This addiction causes psychological and physical dependence and a detrimental effect on both individuals and society. This complicates the treatment project process, especially if the patient/addict suffers from psychological and/or mental disorders associated with addiction. In particular, personality disorders have a direct impact on the behaviors, performance, functions and thinking patterns of the sufferer. As the latter adopts an unhealthy and rigid pattern that causes them and those around them to suffer several psychological, health, social, professional and relational problems... Relatedly, we decided to present a clinical case with a dual diagnosis, as this patient has been suffering from the consequences of addiction for many years accompanied by a personality disorder. As for the clinical symptoms that top the clinical board of the case, we find a complete aversion to his body as he has not looked in the mirror for nearly 30 years. The patient has lost the symbolic representation of his body as a physical reality through which it is located internally, externally and cognitively. This comes in addition to severe clinical suffering at the level of familial, social and professional relationships, which made him live in a state of permanent social isolation. In our therapeutic approach to the condition, we use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a common type of psychotherapy in a regular manner, through a limited number of therapeutic sessions. The therapeutic intervention was carried out at the level of perception of incorrect or negative thinking, which enabled difficult situations to be presented more clearly and responded to in a more effective manner.

      "abstract": "Climate solutions are available now, are widespread, and support psychological health.Increasing adoption of active commuting, public transportation, green spaces, and clean energy are all solutions that people can choose to support and integrate into their daily lives.These climate solutions, among others, can help to curb the stress, anxiety, and other mental illnesses incurred from the decline of economies, infrastructure, and social identity that comes from damage to the climate.Major acute mental health impacts include increases in trauma and shock, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compounded stress, anxiety, substance abuse, and depression.Climate changeinduced extreme weather, changing weather patterns, damaged food and water resources, and polluted air impact human mental health.Increased levels of stress and distress from these factors can also put strains on social relationships and even have impacts on physical health, such as memory loss, sleep disorders, immune suppression, and changes in digestion.Major chronic mental health impacts include higher rates of aggression and violence, more mental health emergencies, an increased sense of helplessness, hopelessness, or fatalism, and intense feelings of loss.These feelings of loss may be due to profound changes in a personally important place (such as one's home) and/ or a sense that one has lost control over events in one's life due to disturbances from climate change.Additionally, a sense of loss regarding one's personal or occupational identity can arise when treasured objects are destroyed by a disaster or place-based occupations are disrupted by climate change.Personal relationships and the ways in which people interact in communities and with each other are affected by a changing climate.Compounded stress from a changing environment, ecomigration, and/or ecoanxiety can affect community mental well-being through the loss of social identity and cohesion, hostility, violence, and interpersonal and intergroup aggression.Recent increases in natural disasters illustrate the relationship between the acceleration of climate change and severe weather.Areas that endure a natural disaster face a number of risks and difficulties.Direct physical impacts range from brute physical trauma to more pernicious effects, like increased incidence of infectious disease, asthma, heart disease, and lung problems.These physical health impacts interact with mental health impacts, which is why they are detailed in this report on page 39.In this section, we use floods, the most common form of natural disasters (EM-DAT, 2011, as reported in Alderman, Turner, & Tong, 2012), as an example to illustrate the ways in which direct health impacts of disasters come about.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is a complex multidimensional phenomenon. Pain complaints in the elderly are modulated by several psychosocial factors. They can be understood as a way to indicate suffering or to get attention and sometimes as a mean to regain self-esteem. There is little quantitative change in pain associated psychopathology and coping mechanisms in the elderly as compared to younger patients. However, qualitative changes are identified. The high degree of association between chronic pain and depression remains throughout the age span. However, age variations in the expression of psychological distress are to be noted. Elderly patients have a tendency to make a greater use of somatic complaints and avoid the expression of the emotional dimension of distress. This clinical particularity is discussed. Special attention should be paid to the multidimensional aspects of pain complaints in the elderly in order not to underestimate its affective components.",

      "abstract": "Proses penuaan lansia akan mengalami kemunduran fisik dan mental, namun pada kenyataannya hal tersebut ternyata bervariasi tergantung dari gaya hidup sewaktu muda. Angka harapan hidup diperkirakan mencapai 73,7 tahun, suatu peningkatan yang cukup tinggi dari angka 69,0 tahun pada saat ini. Seiring dengan peningkatan usia lanjut dan tingginya harapan hidup, masalah kesehatan pada lansia juga menonjol, baik fisik maupun psikologis. Salah satunya masalah psikis yang sering dihadapi oleh lansia yaitu depresi. Depresi adalah gangguan alam perasaan ( mood ) yang ditandai dengan kemurungan dan kesedihan yang mendalam dan berkenjutan sehingga hilangnya kegairahan hidup. Usia harapan hidup semakin bertambah, stressor psikososial semakin berat, berbagai penyakit kronik dan kehidupan beragama semakin ditinggalkan serta mengakibatkan ketergantungan kepada orang lain. Apabila ketergantungan pada lansia tidak segera diatasi, maka akan menimbulkan beberapa akibat seperti gangguan sistem tubuh, timbulnya penyakit, menurunnya Activity of Daily Living (ADL). Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk melihat  hubungan kejadian depresi dengan kemampuan melakukan aktifitas dasar sehari-hari.  Penelitian ini dengan jenis analitik dengan desain penelitian yang digunakan adalah cross sectional . Hasil penelitian menunjukan bahwa Depresi merupakan gangguan efek yang sering terjadi pada lanjut usia dan merupakan salah satu gangguan emosi. Pada umumnya efek yang secara dominan muncul adalah perasaan tidak berdaya dan kehilangan harapan hidup. Kata Kunci : Depresi, Lansia, Activity Daily Living (ADL)",

Only one out of ten patients remains completely free of symptoms within an observational period of 3 to 7 years. The majority of patients suffer long-standing anxiety symptoms which do not significantly interfere with working performance or social relationships. Another ten percent of the patients are continuously impaired in everyday living by severe symptoms. Long duration and severe degree of symptoms at the initial assessment, as well as coexistent depression are associated with a poor outcome. There is evidence of an increased mortality in patients with panic disorder. Suicides are overrepresented among the causes of death. It is not clear whether this is due to the frequent comorbidity between panic disorder, major depression, and substance abuse.",

      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

      "abstract": "Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are frequently presented in primary care.1 In about 25–50% of all symptoms presented in primary health care, no support for an underlying physical disease can be found. MUS are a heterogeneous group of symptoms and can involve almost all types of symptoms that patients present to their GP. Functional somatic syndromes, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), as well as symptoms stemming from a specific somatic disease that are more severe, more persistent, or limit functioning to a greater extent than expected, based on (objective) disease parameters, are also referred to as MUS. MUS represent a spectrum of severity from mild via moderate to severe, characterised by an increased number and duration of symptoms and functional limitations. Most of the time MUS are transient and self-limiting, but sometimes MUS persist, resulting in extensive investigations and referrals and unnecessary healthcare costs. Therefore, early recognition of MUS is of paramount importance. Although only 2.5% of the patients in general practice meet criteria for persistent or severe MUS (such multiple symptoms that persist for longer than 3 months resulting in severe functional limitations), GPs experience many difficulties in caring for these patients.2 For that reason the Dutch College of General Practitioners decided to publish the evidence-based primary care guideline on MUS, which provides …",

Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw. Verlauf des Pruritus sowie Hinweise zu ihrer jeweiligen Diagnostik Material und Methode Es handelt sich um eine Überblicksarbeit. Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

      "title": "The Impact of Chemical Changes in The Brain Caused by Chronic Stress Can Trigger Depression",
      "abstract": "The present research has attempted to study the link between chronic stress, the chemical changes in the brain caused by it, and depression. Chronic stress (also known as chronic strain) has been defined in a variety of ways, but it usually refers to one or more types of stress that have persisted for at least many months. Numerous chemical changes occur in the human brain when the human body is subjected to chronic stress over a lengthy period. Chronic or ongoing stress can cause several psychological and physiological problems and stress has been found to influence brain chemicals including cortisol and corticotropin-releasing factor. Cortisol levels that are elevated for an extended period have been related to mood disorders and hippocampus shrinkage in the brain. Stress is a key contributor to chronic inflammation in the body. Furthermore, diabetes and heart disease can also be caused by chronic inflammation. Chronic stress elevates cortisol levels in the blood and has an effect on serotonin levels in the body. This contributes to the fact that continuous stress causes a series of chemical changes in the human brain, which may simply make the individual more prone to developing depression or relapsing (the condition is prone to recur in someone who has recovered). These physiological and biochemical changes make the human body more sensitive to depression and make it more likely to acquire the mental illness (known as Major Depressive Disorder). The current study examined many research studies that support a substantial relationship between chronic stress and depression",

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia is associated with social, economic, and individual burdens, including loss of independence, poor quality of life, and disability. In a short period of time, ideas about sarcopenia transformed from geriatric syndrome to disease. Initially, sarcopenia was considered in the context of gradual age-related deterioration in the functioning of all physiological systems. Over the years, it became clear that it can develop a second time, as a consequence of various diseases and pathological conditions. To date, there have been no generally accepted diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia. There are several tests and tools available for screening sarcopenia, the choice of which depends on physical capabilities of the patient, capabilities of the medical institution, and the purpose for which it is detected (research or clinical practice). From the point of view of human health, sarcopenia increases the risk of falls and fractures; impairs the ability to perform daily activities; is associated with the progression of major diseases and cognitive impairments; leads to movement disorders; contributes to a decrease in the quality of life, loss of independence or a need for long-term care. The presence of sarcopenia increases both the risk of hospitalization and hospitalization costs. The aim of the literature review is to provide an analysis of up-to-date information on the causes, pathogenesis, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and consequences of sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and sarcopenic obesity. The search for literature containing information on relevant studies was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar by the following keywords: sarcopenia, dynapenia, myosteatosis, sarcopenic obesity, nutritional status, malnutrition.",

      "abstract": "Sport retirement is a multifaceted process consisting of a variety of emotional and psychological responses. Sport transitions may be accompanied by changes in identity, interpersonal relationships, schedules, and behavioural changes. Psychosocial outcomes following sport retirement can be broadly differentiated between acute psychological distress, mental health disorders, and healthy adjustment. Acute psychological distress following sport retirement may be best understood in the context of stressful life events. Stressful life events, such as job transitions and family conflict, have been shown to predict the onset of mental health concerns, such as depression. Sport retirement is a significant life event, and negative emotions are a common response to the transition. Adjustment disorder is characterised by the onset of emotional or behavioural symptoms within three months of an identifiable stressor and does not persist past six months after termination of the stressor.",

Symptoms of grief or bereavement may be characterized by agitation, somatic complaint and social withdrawal. Other situational factors may precipitate maladjustment with depressed mood. Of course, general medical problems inherent to late life are associated with loss of autonomy together with increased chronicity of depression and refractoriness to treatment. Some individuals who are depressed may simply develop failure to thrive. Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease. Subsyndromal depression may also be present or atypical forms of depression including masked depression with sadness or dysphoria; depressive pseudodementia with reversible cognitive impairment, and hypochondriasis or depression with prominent somatic complaints.",

In addition to that, heart function, emotions, moods etc. could be mentioned as the results of gradual aging. Such conditions are usually accompanied with increase in medications consumption and decline in quality of life. Though usually medical sciences study mental health conditions, sociology also needs to be applied to appraise the \"cause and effect\" of mental health. As life expectancy is globally increasing, more and more people are subject to mental disorders, Alzheimer's disorders, dementia, depression and many more, as the effects of aging extensively impact mental health. Therefore, under the conditions of rapid aging, geriatrics needs to be strengthened and improved as much as possible to safeguard mental health. However, structural changes in terms of biological, physical, psychological and chemical reactions which inevitably occur with aging, need prevention and appropriate medication, and other investments in long term, and if not, other vulnerabilities will inevitably appear.",

      "abstract": "Ten years research into the physical and psychosocial consequences of severe brain damage in adults has revealed substantial information about the process of recovery. The main features are evidence that the greater part of physical and mental recovery occurs within six months of injury and that in most cases the mental consequences of injury outweigh the physical ones and place the greater burden upon the injured person's relatives. Impairment of memory is the most common cognitive disorder and alterations in personality often occur also and are the most taxing of the mental deficits for all concerned. The process of recovery has three stages, in the first the patient is unconscious, in the second he or she regains full consciousness signified by the end of the period of post traumatic amnesia and continues to show evidence of rapid improvement in basic physical and mental functions. The rate of recovery shows within six months of injury in most cases and this represents the end of the second stage. In the third stage, which may last for many months, both the patient and his or her relatives adapt to the residual disabilities of the former. Methods of managing the three stages should include physical, psychological and social techniques and the way in which they may be linked to the patients' differing physical and psychosocial needs during the three stages of recovery are briefly discussed.",

      "abstract": "The Numbers of elderly people are gradually increasing in our society, and mood disorders are progressively increasing among older people. Old age depression may also occur after life events: the death of the significant other, economical reasons, health problems (neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, nutritional deficiency) and can develop into a depressive state. Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life in older people. Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young/adults and in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality. The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities: - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do not complain about their low mood; - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including hallucinatory symptoms are often present; - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with neuro-sensory symptoms; - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask and overlap the depressive state; - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from \"pseudodementia\" and \"dementia\". In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial disease.",

Fifty-eight MS patients and 259 controls answered a questionnaire covering 15 symptoms and signs of FS. Six of the 15 symptoms and signs of FS (dizziness, low body mass index, cold hands and/or feet, tendency toward perfectionism, reduced thirst, feeling cold) were found significantly more often in MS patients than in controls. Seven additional symptoms and signs (tinnitus, headaches, increased pain sensation, long sleep-onset time, migraines, increased response to certain drugs, low blood pressure) also occurred more often in MS patients, but the difference in frequency was not statistically significant. One sign (reversible skin blotches) was found less often in MS patients, but the difference in frequency was not statistically significant. One symptom (increased smell perception) was found significantly less often in MS patients. MS patients suffer significantly more often from FS symptoms and signs than controls. The reason for this association between MS and FS and the potential implications of this association still need to be determined.",

      "title": "Animal well-being. II. Stress and distress.",
      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

      "title": "Growth at adolescence. Clinical correlates.",
      "abstract": "Several highly significant changes occur within a relatively short period of time during adolescence. Great alteration in physique, developmental progress in thinking, and psychologic gains toward attaining ego identity take place but not always synchronously. Attention is paid to physical changes because they are visible and are of intense concern to adolescents, but physicians and other professionals should remember cognitive and psychosocial growth are affected by physical growth, and vice versa. Often there is a temporary disequilibrium in the relationship of these three areas of growth, and this can affect one or another part of the developmental pattern. It is therefore necessary to remind ourselves of the diversity of adolescent growth, and of adolescents, when caring for a young patient and be cognizant of growth in areas other than physical. More and more children with congenital or acquired handicaps are living to become adolescents and perhaps adults. Handicaps can be limited to one of the three major areas of growth or involve them all in varying degrees. For example, sickle cell disease, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis may postpone physical growth for a significant period; this lack of pubertal change can affect psychosocial development but usually does not impair cognitive growth. Mental retardation may have no apparent effect on physical growth but can handicap the adolescent's psychosocial development. Growth still occurs in a sequential pattern but often it seems that handicapped youngsters reach a developmental milestone by a series of \"detours.\" Physicians must recognize these lags or differences and try to facilitate progress, promote self-esteem, and provide understanding. Much can be done with anticipatory guidance. Adolescence often provides the opportunity to overcome past damage or, in some instances, to start anew on a more optimal program for physical and psychosocial growth. Young adolescent boys and girls usually look to the physician for factual information and guidance; they long for understanding by an adult outside of the family. If we can successfully fill their expectations, adolescents will be the better for it.",

      "title": "Guidelines for treating depressive illness with antidepressants: A statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common illness which affects some 3% of the population per year. At least 25% of those with marked depression do not consult their general practitioner and in half of those who do the illness is not detected. Depression is easy to recognize when four or five of the core symptoms have been present for 2 weeks which often coincides with some occupational and social impairment. The core symptoms are depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, loss of energy or fatigue, concentration difficulties, appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, agitation or retardation, worthlessness or self blame and suicidal thoughts. A diagnosis of depression is made when five of these core symptoms, one of which should be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, have been present for 2 weeks. Four core symptoms are probably sufficient. Response to antidepressants is good in those with more than mild symptoms. When there are only few or very mild depressive symptoms evidence of response to antidepressants is more uncertain. Antidepressants are effective, they are not addictive and do not lose efficacy with prolonged use. The newer antidepressants have fewer side effects than the older tricyclics, they are better tolerated and lead to less withdrawals from treatment. They are less cardiotoxic and are safer in overdose. Antidepressants should be used at full therapeutic doses. Treatment failure is often due to too low a dose being used in general practice. It may be difficult to reach the right dose with the older tricyclics because of side effects. To consolidate response, treatment should be continued for at least 4 months after the patient is apparently well. Stopping the treatment before this is ill-advised as the partially treated depression frequently returns. Most depression is recurrent. Long-term antidepressant treatment is effective in reducing the risk of new episodes of depression and should be continued to keep the patient well.",

      "title": "Anxiety and sleep disorders in cancer patients",
      "abstract": "Even though most cancer patients do not meet diagnostic criteria for any specific mental disorder [1], many experience symptoms such as anxiety and sleep disturbances that may interfere with their overall adjustment to their disease. Anxiety is a common reaction to a cancer diagnosis and a normal response to perceived threats like loss of body functions, alterations in appearance, family disruption, death, etc. Anxiety may persist throughout the disease process, affecting the patient’s quality of life significantly, and often coexists with depression in cancer patients. Anxiety tends to appear or worsen at critical points during the course of the illness (diagnosis, beginning and end of treatment, recurrence, survival and terminal stage).\r\n\r\nSleep disorders are frequently associated with the psychological impact of cancer as well as with the physical illness itself, pain, hospitalisation and specific medical treatments. Altered sleep adversely affects emotional wellbeing and daytime performance, and may be an early sign of delirium in the oncology setting. In the general population, persistent insomnia has been associated with a higher risk of developing clinical anxiety or depression [2].\r\n\r\nTo effectively adjust patient needs to optimal treatment interventions, health-care professionals must be able to distinguish normal adjustment to cancer from altered reactions to the disease. This paper will focus on anxiety and sleep disorders in the oncology setting and will describe their clinical presentation, assessment, aetiology and treatment.",

The SCN aligns whole-body cellular, behavioral and phenomenological processes with the Earth’s 24-hour day/night rhythm. When disruptions to the SCN’s perceptual system occur (e.g., “jet-lag,” prolonged waking, chronic exposure to light at night or habit change as the result of becoming a parent), disrupted melatonin and glucocorticoid secretion can lead to widespread dysregulation of sleep and circadian cycling. The effects of circadian disruptions are often compounded by the homeostatic sleep drive, wherein sleep pressure accumulates with protracted wakefulness to affect mood, cognition, health and well-being.",

Though in present scenario “Psychological Health” is a relatively negligible term; may be because it does not attract much commercial interests. But if we analyze, all our being is based on Psychological Health. Psychological Health is based on interaction of our biological system with the society and the nature. Biological aspects needs biological intervention, and social and nature interactions needs psychological intervention; hence interdisciplinary. Majority of the health issues like cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, insomnia, depression, etc., has some link with Psychological Health. Quality sleep which is the basis of almost all health aspects has direct link with psychological health. Our behavior, relevancy and efficiency of our working, our comprehending ability, etc., are based on our Psychological Status. Thus we can say our happiness depends on Physiological Health; as better health, and better performance and good behavior, makes us happy and satisfied. We have explored in this article importance of Psychological Health, in context to overall health related to: thoughts, superiority, romance, learning, physical activity, etc; and for what interventions can be made, at both psychological and physical level. As our topic may interest even common individual, hence language has been purposely kept simple.",

      "title": "Ruminative Coping with Depression",
      "abstract": "Most people have periods in which they become at least moderately depressed: they feel sad, they lose their motivation and interest in their usual activities, they slow down and are chronically fatigued, and so on. For most people, these periods last only a few days and their symptoms never become debilitating. For others, these periods last weeks or months, and their symptoms become worse with time. I suggest that the ways people initially try to regulate or cope with their symptoms of depression can affect the severity and duration of these symptoms. Specifically, people who have a ruminative style of responding to their initial symptoms of depression will have longer and more severe episodes of depressed mood than people who have more active, less ruminative response styles. A ruminative response style for depression is defined as the tendency to focus passively and repetitively on one's symptoms of depression and on the possible causes and consequences of those symptoms without taking action to relieve them. Ruminative responses to depression exacerbate and prolong periods of depression through at least three mechanisms. First, rumination enhances the negative effects of depressed mood on thinking, making depressive interpretations of events and negative memories more accessible and more likely to be used in ongoing deliberations about one's life. Second, rumination interferes with complex interpersonal problem-solving, in part because it enhances pessimistic, distorted thinking. Third, rumination inhibits people from engaging in everyday instrumental behaviors that could enhance their sense of control and lift their moods.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest that anxiety and depression are less common in older than younger adults. One in ten people aged > or = 65 fulfils the diagnostic criteria for at least one common mental disorder. Older depressed patients have an increased risk of both cardiac and all-cause mortality. Both anxiety and depression in older patients are often unrecognised and untreated, and have a poor prognosis. There is a progressive decline in the prevalence of common mental disorders above the age of 55. Anxiety and depression often occur together, and share many risk factors. However, anxiety tends to follow threats or traumatic events, whereas depression follows loss events. Chronic diseases, cognitive impairment, pain and functional disability are risk factors for the onset of depression, but not anxiety. Depression is between two and three times more common among those with a chronic physical health problem. Even patients with major depression often remain unrecognised and untreated. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is by far the most common anxiety disorder in older people but most GAD patients are not recognised in primary care and only a third of them receive any form of treatment. Older patients often deny feeling anxious or depressed and are more likely to present with insomnia, irritability, agitation and multiple somatic complaints. GPs may erroneously believe that depression is a normal reaction to the losses of old age, and may be reluctant to initiate treatment. A good case can be made for replacing the PHQ-9 with the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale which almost entirely avoids somatic questions. This is a screening not a diagnostic tool and does not evaluate symptom severity.",

In this article, we focussed on) the clinical evaluation, the semiology of somatic symptoms and the management of pediatric SSD. The clinical assessment is multidisciplinary and must consider the environment in which the child develops. One may distinguish general signs (common to all SDD) and specific signs (which will guide the differential diagnosis for particular somatic pathology). When the diagnosis of SDD is certain or even probable, effective interventions should be implemented. Medical interventions are based on diagnostic information appropriate to the child and his family, a coordinated healthcare circuit and behavioral interventions determined from the functional analysis of symptoms of SDD.Troubles à symptomatologie somatique de l’enfant. Les symptômes somatoformes sont très fréquents chez l’enfant. Lorsqu’ils ont un retentissement fonctionnel majeur, ils constituent un trouble à symptomatologie somatique. Cette mise au point aborde l’évaluation clinique de ces troubles, leur sémiologie et leur prise en charge chez l’enfant. L’évaluation clinique est multidisciplinaire et doit prendre en compte l’environnement dans lequel l’enfant se développe. Le critère clinique essentiel est la réponse inadaptée de l’enfant à un ou plusieurs symptômes. On distingue des signes généraux (communs à l’ensemble des troubles à symptomatologie somatique) et des signes spécifiques (qui permettent d’orienter le diagnostic différentiel par rapport à une pathologie somatique particulière). Quand le diagnostic de troubles à symptomatologie somatique est considéré comme assuré ou seulement probable, des interventions appropriées doivent être mises en place. La prise en charge se fonde sur une information diagnostique claire et appropriée à l’enfant et sa famille, une coordination médicale du parcours de soins et des interventions comportementales déterminées à partir de l’analyse fonctionnelle des symptômes du trouble.",

The DSM-V then classifies insomnia as either episodic (at least 1 month but less than 3 months), persistent (lasting 3 months or more) and recurrent (2 or more episodes within a year), and considers potential contributing comorbidities. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) classification system, symptoms must occur at least 3 times per week, and insomnia is categorized as either short term or chronic. Short-term insomnia disorder in this paradigm (ICSD-3) occurs when the sleep problems have lasted more than 1 but less than 3 months, while chronic insomnia disorder occurs when symptoms persist for more than 3 months.",

Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

Insomnia or Nidranasha, is not just about being not getting proper sleep but it means that the nervous system has been weakened and reduces our ability to cope up with daily sleep. Insomnia is named as Nidranasha, happens due to vitiation of Kapha, Pitta and Vata dosha. Proper and deep sleep helps the person keep Energetic, Enthusiastic, does Brumhana, increases the Bala, increases vigour and vitality and most it keeps the Mind in stable state for gaining knowledge. Insomnia means inability to get sleep at night or inability to have a restful and sound sleep. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Arthritis, menopause, and certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol.

      "abstract": "Health and disease processes are developed due to biological, psychological and social determinants. Obesity is usually associated with mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. This association is evidenced in both directions. Mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders, contribute to the development of obesity, as well as obesity increases the incidence of mental disorders. When stability and homeostasis are disrupted, due to chronic stress and factors such as genetics, environment, affective relationships and psychosocial support, allostatic overload is evidenced. Through this overload, multiple systems are misbalanced and clinical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, occur. The diagnoses of mental disorders are made based on a combination of somatic and psychiatric symptoms. Unexplained physical complaints and generic symptoms like depressed mood, sadness, impatience, irritability and restlessness are the most frequent ones, together with sleep and appetite disturbances, caused both by physical and mental disorders. These factors often make the correct diagnosis in obese patients more difficult. The primary care professionals must be alert to physical complaints and psychological distress present in organic disorders. The understanding of physiopathological effects of stress and emotional suffering in somatic disorders reinforces that effective care in chronic diseases, such as obesity, has to be organized including these aspects. Treatment needs to be comprehensive so that care can be effective and physical and mental disorders can be properly solved. New therapeutic approaches must be focused on the person, the family and the community instead of focused on the disease. This is essential in the treatment of obesity as it is directly associated with lifestyle, emotional state and stress level, which depends on a change of the individual and his ways of living to be solved. Through this approach, primary care may promote health and prevent diseases.",

Although some contradictory results exist, the majority of studies demonstrate that depressed patients experience more stressful events in the months that precede the onset of their disorder than do normal controls or schizophrenics. In calculating relative risk figures, it seems that depressive risk is increased by a factor of about 5 or 6 for the six months after an event. Certain events, such as undesirable, loss, or severely threatening events, are particularly likely to precede a depression. These results suggest that stressful events can bring about depressive episodes, but most of the evidence that supports this conclusion emanates from retrospective studies, and corroborating prospective studies are definitely needed. Furthermore, not all depressives report precipitating events, so other causal factors are also operative.",

If you've answered yes to these questions, chances are you're stressed out .Stress is not always bad; it is our body's way of preparing us for the challenge a-head. Some amount of stress is in fact, healthy; some stressors get you going and help you to accomplish your goals. However, situations that over-whelm us cause distress .Our life require us to deal with many challenges simultaneously. When 'things become too much' stress can have an adverse impact on the mind, body, emotions and behavior eventually resulting in health problems .People often cope with stress by resorting to unhealthy behaviors such as drinking, smoking, comfort, eating and self-medicating . At work, stress manifests itself in increased absenteeism; stressed people tend to fall ill more often .Silly mistakes, difficulties making decisions, poor work performance, being hostile towards co-workers and clients, and inability to follow through on deadlines are some signs of work- related stress. When left unaddressed chronic stress can lead to burnout, a debilitating condition of emotional exhaustion, apathy and cynicism. Effective management of stress can lead to harmony in personal and professional relationships resulting in a calmer and healthier self. Our tolerance of stress largely depends on the support system , we have including our friends and family .Having the right attitude and outlook can help one embrace challenges and take charge.

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

Among all mental health illnesses, sexual dysfunction is underestimated and more common in the general population compared to those with mental health issues. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the sexual abnormalities and behaviors that are often seen in bipolar female patients. Final thoughts: Sexual dysfunctions and abnormal behaviors were more common in women with BD. Manic episodes are associated with increased hazardous sexual conduct in people with BD. Additionally, it was mentioned that couples' sexual pleasure is negatively impacted by hypersexuality during manic episodes and hyposexuality during depressed episodes, and this effect typically continues into the times between episodes. On the other hand, sex may be linked to negative emotions rather than diminished desire during depressed periods. Individuals with mental health illnesses have a greater chance of sexual difficulties damaging personal interactions and quality of life.",

So defined, it is neither a disorder nor a diagnostic category but a generic term for a set of experiential, cognitive, and behavioral characteristics of patients who complain of physical symptoms in the absence of relevant medical findings. Such patients are ubiquitous in all medical care settings, pose difficult diagnostic and management problems, and overutilize health care thus contributing to its cost. Somatization may be transient or persistent, and may or may not be associated with a diagnosable medical or psychiatric disorder. The most common concurrence of somatization is with affective and anxiety disorders, and, to a lesser degree, the somatoform disorders. Persistent somatization poses a serious clinical, social, and economic problem and hence early identification of potential chronic somatizers should be attempted to avoid its development. Pain, fatigue, dizziness, and dyspnea are the commonest symptoms. Etiology of somatization is multifactorial and so should be its management.",

Placement of children \nand adolescents in residential treatment occurs for a variety of reasons, ranging from \nsevere psychopathology or extreme behavior problems (including legal involvement) \nto significant family dysfunction that interferes with healthy and successful academic, \nsocial, and community functioning. Many young people referred for residential treatment have a long history of family dysfunction that may include experiences of abuse, \ndomestic violence, substance abuse in the home, or neglect, and often school failure \nand aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. Typical diagnoses include Major Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychotic Disorders, Conduct Disorder, Substance \nAbuse Disorders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and other severe personality and \npsychological disorders. They often present with symptoms of oppositional/defiant \nbehavior, anger outbursts, severe mood disturbance, anxiety, self-injurious behaviors, \nsubstance abuse, and poor social skills. It is widely accepted that placing children in the \nleast restrictive placement possible is the goal; however, a child’s referral for this level \nof care often results from the need for more intensive treatment than can be obtained \nthrough outpatient means.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

In older people, the relationship between depression and impaired social functioning and quality of life is complex and ill defined. Despite well-tolerated and effective treatments, many depressed individuals are undiagnosed or under-treated. The impact of depression on the quality of life (QOL) and social functioning of older people can be considerable. Furthermore, impairment of social functioning, consequent on the social isolation and functional disability that goes hand-in-hand with ageing, may be a causative factor in old age depression. Once depression develops, it may result in further narrowing of social repertoire, compounding the problem. Notwithstanding some of the difficulties in measuring social functioning and quality of life, progress has been made in defining the extent of these problems in older depressed individuals. The impact treatment of depression has on these parameters is becoming increasingly recognised and evaluated in clinical trials.",

Various situational factors have been considered as possible precipitants of emotional disturbances: a child marrying, or having 3 or more children. However, studies indicate that women in the year of the menopause were less likely to develop an episode of mental illness requiring admission to a hospital than at other times. Estrogens do improve symptoms of flushes, dryness and sweats. Changes in emotional imbalance are less clear. Women who come for treatment of menopausal symptoms may frequently be suffering from depression which makes toleration of these symptoms more difficult.",

Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental illnesses together with sleep disorders and astheno-neurotic syndrome [3]. Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term, uncorrected disturbances of circadian rhythms lead to clinically significant distress and cause mental, physical, social, professional, educational, or other functional impairments [6].",

These emotional disturbances may be relatively acute in an otherwise stable person, or, as is so often the case, they stem from a chronic, lifelong instability of personality. They are translated into symptoms by means of: (1) tension primarily in the autonomic nervous system and (2) symbolism. When a person is afraid, or hates or is irritable, his heart rate tends to increase, his blood pressure to rise, his intestines to contract. These manifestations result from disturbed activity of the autonomic nervous system (usually both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems are involved), and since every portion of the organism is under the influence of these symptoms, the unstable and emotional person tends to have symptoms in most of the body. Many neurotic patients will come to the physician with one presenting complaint, yet on more thorough investigation",

The DSM-IV also excludes confounding disorders and requires confirmation of the diagnosis after 2 months of prospective daily ratings. These strict criteria reinforce the fact that not all women who have premenstrual symptoms have a mental illness. These criteria also allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which is primarily reserved for milder physical and emotional symptoms.5 These criteria allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual magnification (PMM), which occurs when symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric or medical disorder are magnified during the premenstruum.6",

The diagnosis is relatively easy in the classical forms, with a meticulous interview when the context and the patient's complaints are in favour of this condition, but there are various cases in which the symptoms are not typical or in which other diagnoses are in the forefront. In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

Most illnesses, except the very trivial, require a period of adjustment and a re-appraisal of lifestyle, ability to work and engagement in leisure activities. Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression. Depression resulting from the emotional impact of an illness follows an appraisal of the implications that the illness has on relationships, lifestyle, work prospects, long-term disability and mortality.",

      "abstract": "Se estudian, con el fin de valorar su utilidad diagnóstica, los síntomas de tipo somático que carecen de una base orgánica demostrable (síntomas hipocondríacos) en 152 enfermos depresivos mayores de 60 años ingresados en un Servicio Psico-Geriátrico de Londres. &#x0D; &#x0D; Más de la mitad de los enfermos (63,81%) presentaron estos síntomas. Esta cifra es mucho más elevada que la que se encuentra en enfermos depresivos más jóvenes y puede atribuirse al efecto patoplástico de la edad. El sexo del enfermo no guarda ninguna relación estadística con la frecuencia con que aparecen estos síntomas. &#x0D; &#x0D; Los síntomas hipocondríacos se manifestaron, solos, o acompañados de otros síntomas depresivos, desde el comienzo de la enfermedad en 72-casos (47,3%).

Emotions and moods have a physical effect on the body, and what happens to the body, and how you react to it, has an effect on the mind. If you are ill, you are likely to have moments when you experience feelings of loss, envy, anger, frustration, worry and anxiety, fear or low spirits.

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Individuals living with chronic health conditions are often advised to adopt healthier lifestyles, including improving their nutrition. What is often disregarded by health professionals is that information-giving is often insufficient in supporting maintainable, substantial changes. Making long-term alterations to one9s lifestyle is challenging regardless of one9s circumstances. However, in the context of managing a chronic health condition one is faced with psychological barriers of a specific kind. Individuals with chronic health conditions may dislike being reminded of their physical difficulties, but adhering to a new 9healthier9 schedule means that one remains vigilant of daily choices and is consequently more aware of the underlying health condition. This awareness may result in undesirable emotional states such as sadness or anxiety that one might find difficult to handle. In an effort to then avoid, deny, or numb oneself from the worries or reminders of the chronic illness, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain a healthier lifestyle. The presentation will introduce mindfulness techniques for identifying and better handling undesirable thoughts, emotions and physical sensations that may act as barriers to healthier lifestyles. It will also discuss ways for initiating and maintaining internally motivated lifestyle changes though the activation of one9s personal values rather than acting on mandates of others such as family members or health professionals. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared <h3>DOI</h3> 10.1136/annrheumdis-2014-eular.6127",

      "title": "A Life Setting Conducive to Illness",
      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

      "title": "Combined Exercise Programmes for Improving the Mood and Mental Health of Older People With Mild Cognitive Impairment",
      "abstract": "To Editor, Regular exercise and/or physical activity have long been recognised for their numerous benefits on physical health, but their impact on mental health and mood, particularly in older people experiencing cognitive decline, is equally profound. Cognitive decline, which may manifest as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or progress to conditions like Alzheimer's disease, is often accompanied by mood disturbances such as depression, anxiety and irritability (Ismail et al. 2018). Engaging in consistent physical activity has been shown to mitigate these issues, offering both physiological and psychological benefits that enhance overall quality of life (Kim and Lim 2022). Depression and anxiety are common symptoms in older people with cognitive decline. These mood disorders can worsen cognitive symptoms, creating a vicious cycle of poor mental and emotional health, and chronic stress is a significant risk factor for both cognitive decline and mental health in older people. Regular exercise and/or physical activity act as a natural stress reliever by lowering levels of cortisol, the body's main stress hormone, and physical activity also helps manage emotional issues associated with cognitive impairment by providing a constructive outlet for tension and frustration (Smyth et al. 2020; Quinn et al. 2016). The effectiveness of regular exercise and/or physical activity in improving mood and mental health depends on its consistency and suitability for the individual. Older people with cognitive decline may have physical limitations or comorbid conditions that require tailored exercise programmes. Consistency is crucial for reaping the mental health benefits of exercise and/or physical activity. Even moderate physical activity—as little as five 30-min bouts of moderate intensity or three 25-min bouts of vigorous intensity per week—can lead to noticeable improvements in mood and cognitive function. Regular exercise and/or physical activity are powerful tools for improving mood and mental health in older people experiencing cognitive decline. Through physiological mechanisms such as increased neuroplasticity and reduced inflammation, as well as psychological benefits such as stress reduction and enhanced social connections, exercise addresses multiple dimensions of mental well-being (Lee et al. 2021). By incorporating consistent and individualised physical activity into their lives, older people with cognitive decline can experience significant improvements in mood, resilience and overall quality of life. This underscores the importance of promoting exercise as a key component of holistic care for this vulnerable population.

Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

      "abstract": "As Far As We Can Tell, Two Powerful Brain Events Always Occur with Sexual Experience:* Attachment (bonding) to the sexual partner* Desire for repetition of sex acts (addiction)Sex may not always lead to permanent attachment or uncontrolled addictive behavior because of multiple other influences (family, faith, control of actions by higher brain centers, etc.) But observations of brains with new imaging techniques and of behavior suggest that sexual experience can have a powerful brain impact.1 PET scans can identify specific areas of the brain involved when a person is interested in another person, but cannot distinguish between lust and Only time and other behaviors can reveal the difference.2* Lust is a powerful emotional state and can cause people to do things that they would not ordinarily do, often for self-gratification.* Early is a powerful emotional state, which can last several months and cause people to think of doing things they would not ordinarily do.* Mature love is the deep, abiding love of a couple that stays together and follows the healthy evolution of early love. It is the stability of this mature love on which marriage, home, & family depend.3A separate brain area for pain has also been identified. The brain lights in the same area if it's physical pain, like a broken bone, or emotional pain, like a broken relationship.4 Emotional Consequences of Sexual Activity with broken relationships:* Pain and suffering from broken relationships* Fear, confusion about romantic feelings* Altered self-esteem* Sense of betrayal and abandonment* Guilt, depression and emotional rollercoaster* Impaired ability to form healthy long-term relationshipsBroken bonding may explain a large percentage of adolescent depression. According to a national survey of teen health, girls who were sexually active were three times more likely to be depressed than those who were abstinent. Suicide is attempted more often by sexually active teens than those who have not had sex: three times more often by girls and eight times more often by boys.5Sex & Depression - College Students* 30% of students reported they felt so depressed that it was sometimes hard for them to function.* 6% of students reported seriously considering attempting suicide at least once during the past year and 1.3% had actually attempted suicide.6Damage to the Human Bonding Ability* Individuals who have had multiple sexual partners prior to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than individuals who did not have multiple partners prior to marriage.* Couples who cohabit before committing to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than couples who did not cohabit.'Young Women Are More Vulnerable to premature sexual activity. They are much more likely to be pressured for sex8 and their behavior decisions can be influenced unconsciously.9* By pheromones. Young women are sensitive to pheromonal concentrations as little as l/100th of a drop. These powerful chemicals influence desire for sex, and cause the young womans mood to brighten and mental focus to sharpen, increasing propensity to sexual behavior.* By release of oxytocin with sexual activity. Oxytocin not only makes them bond it can also make them trust. More women than men say their beloved's faults don't matter much to them and women score higher on the test of passionate love.The Emotional TruthsFifty percent of teen relationships break within six months of beginning a sexual relationship. Many teens report two weeks is common length of relationships. This has spawned the concept of up = sex without relationship. Hooking results in unhealthy molding of the brain. More sex partners may lead to attachment difficulty. Brain molding that result from incomplete or unhealthy attachments is a threat to one's emotional and physical health. …",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

      "abstract": "Depression considers one of the most common symptoms associated with malignancy that is difficult to detect and therefore treat. It consists of a significant psychological disorder, which worsens during chemotherapy and can continue after the end of chemotherapy or in the recurrence of treatment and adversely affect the quality of life. Depression often accompanies many symptoms, such as fatigue, weight loss and food disorders widely accepted as a result of cancer. The current study was to designed investigate depression symptoms among cancer patients during chemotherapy and its association with socio-demographic data. However, the difficult economic conditions and financial problems were the most obvious reasons and the unrecognised social problems of people who lost a partner or living alone who contributed to depression in the cancer patient. The treatment of patients with another type of cancer in another organ of the body or originally infected with Chronic diseases condition increases the patient's ill-being, lack of medication, supplies and frequent visits of the hospital, especially for visitors from villages outside cities, number of chemotherapy cycle Especially when the patient is responsible for the family. Patients during chemotherapy usually have symptoms as a result of their cancer or treatment side effect. These symptoms have been affected by the physical and emotional conditions of the patients and also have a negative effect on treatment. Cancer patients may be subject to psychological disorder during the clinical course of their illness.",

      "abstract": "A variety of subjective illnesses with few or no objective findings have appeared at regular intervals as epidemics in our society under different labels. There are few or no objective findings that might explain the \"disease\" or the complaints go beyond what is regarded as \"reasonable\" by the physician. Muscle pain and other types of subjective health complaints are among the most frequent reason for encounters with general practitioners, and one of the major causes for sickness absence. The prevalence of subjective health complaints is very high, with at least 75% of the population reporting one or more subjective health complaints the past 30 days. From a statistical point of view, it is \"normal\" to have complaints. It is when they become intolerable that assistance is required. The difficult thing is that this threshold is individual and subjective. The psychiatric definitions of these complaints, therefore, refer only to the tip of an iceberg.",

      "title": "Natural history of alcohol use disorders in liver transplant patients",
      "abstract": "A. Liver transplantation (LT) patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) often have the comorbid psychiatric disorder of alcohol dependence (AD). 1. Not all patients with AD will develop ALD. 2. Most, but not all patients, with ALD will be AD. 3. Approximately 75-80% of ALD LT patients have AD. B. Diagnostic criteria of alcohol use disorders. 1. Alcohol abuse. a. Clinically important impairment or distress repeatedly in one or more of the following items in a 12-month period. i. Failure to fulfill major obligations (e.g., absences/suspension from work, neglecting household duties). ii. Physically hazardous (e.g., driving while intoxicated). iii. Legal problems (e.g., disorderly conduct, arrest for driving while intoxicated). iv. Social/interpersonal problems (e.g., arguments with spouse about drinking, physical fights). b. Approximately 60% continue with abuse; only 10% go on to develop AD. 2. Diagnostic criteria of AD. a. Clinically important impairment or distress in 3 or more of the following in a 12-month period. i. Tolerance (e.g., increased amount needed for effect, diminished effect). ii. Withdrawal (e.g., autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, or use to avoid withdrawal). iii. Larger amounts/longer period than intended. iv. Persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to cut down. v. Excessive time spent with alcohol (e.g., spending all of spare time at bar or recovering from effects of alcohol). vi. Activities given up as a result of alcohol (social, occupational, recreational activities give up to use alcohol instead—e.g., preferring to drink instead of attending son's baseball game). vii. Continued use despite problems (e.g., knowing of physical disease such as liver disease or psychological problem such as depression caused or worsened by alcohol use). b. Most LT candidates with ALD meet diagnostic criteria for AD (∼75-80%). c. Nearly 70% of our alcohol-dependent LT cohort endorsed ≥4 of these criteria (when they were active in their addiction before LT). d. Lifetime prevalence of AD is approximately 4%. LT, liver transplantation; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; AD, alcohol dependence; HCV, hepatitis C virus. A. First use of alcohol typically begins early with the development of dependence by early adulthood. 1. AD remains stable over years (unless a patient abstains). 2. Associated with a 10-15-year decrease in life span for a variety of health reasons (including, trauma, suicide). 3. Most (nearly 75%) of those with AD never receive treatment. 4. Physicians need to screen for alcohol consumption and refer AD patients for treatment. B. AD is a chronic medical disorder. 1. Heritability estimates from twin studies indicate that a 60% variance of risk is genetic (heterogeneous and polygenic). 2. Risk factors reflect familial/genetic factors and environment and personal choice. 3. Dependence has a distinct pathophysiology. 4. Effects on brain circuitry. a) Alcohol/drugs either directly or indirectly acutely activate mesolimbic dopamine-rich reward system. b) Prolonged use→changes in brain function. i. Brain metabolic activity. ii. Receptor availability. iii. Gene expression. iv. Responsiveness to environmental cues. c. Unclear whether changes return to normal with abstinence. 5. Changes in brain circuitry→increased difficulty changing alcohol behavior. a. Pairing of person/places/things/specific emotions→rapid and entrenched learning/conditioning. b. May elicit cravings even after long abstinence. C. Treatment is effective. 1. Goals. a. Minimize symptoms/exacerbations. b. Maximize function (physical, social, and role function). c. Treatment requires chronic care and monitoring. i. Insurance restrictions often limit covered services. ii. Emphasis is on acute care rather than ongoing treatment or on the process of relapse to prevent recurrence. 2. Treatment does not cure but reduces symptoms/improve functioning. 3. Longer treatment course more effective. i. Marked decrease in alcohol use in persons in treatment <3 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program lowered 35%, outpatient lowered 65%. ii. Much lowered use if in treatment ≥6 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program/outpatient lowered 75%-80%. A. The percentage of those receiving LT for ALD with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been relatively stable, if not slightly decreasing over the past decade representing 15-20% of all U.S. LTs. B. Patients with ALD are not proportionally represented among LT recipients. ALD accounts for: 1. Thirty percent of all liver deaths in United States. 2. Only 15% of all LTs in the United States. C. AD is a chronic medical illness that spans decades. 1. After ≥10 years of AD, as few as 20-35% will be abstinent for 1 year. 2. Patients with ALD often drink in a heavy, sustained pattern for 10-20 years. 3. Patients referred for transplant often, but not always, have a sustained period of sobriety. D. Patients with AD have greater odds of having: 1. Mood disorder (mostly depression)—4× risk. 2. Drug dependence—37× risk. 3. Nicotine dependence—6.4× risk. E. Our cohort of 208 ALD LT patients. 1. Predominately white men, average age 51 years. 2. Nearly 75% AD. 3. Approximately 60% family history of alcohol use disorder. 4. Seventeen percent depressive disorder. 5. Forty-one percent used drugs in addition to alcohol (38% used intravenous drugs). 6. Nearly 75% used nicotine (smoked or smokeless). 7. Eight percent sober for ≥1 year. 8. Forty-five percent attended addiction rehabilitation. 9. Many similarities to the AD population in general. A. Time to specific alcohol use outcomes by 5 years after LT in a cohort. 1. Any alcohol use—43% had had at least one drink. 2. Binge use—27% had at least a single binge episode (defined as ≥6 drinks per occasion). 3. Frequency use—20% had at least a 1-week period that included 4 days of drinking. 4. Drinking most often began within the first post-LT year but could begin even after ≥4 years of post-LT sobriety. B. Those who took a first drink were at very high risk to continue drinking and to escalate to other, more serious patterns of use. Sixty percent who took a first drink eventually went on to have a binge episode. Additionally, for 20%, their first drink was a binge episode, highlighting the quick loss of control over drinking. For this reason, we recommend no alcohol at all, not even a single drink for a special occasion. C. Drinking trajectories—demonstrating the quantity, frequency, and duration of alcohol consumption. 1. Seventy-one percent either were complete abstainers or drank very minimally on 1-2 occasions. 2. Sixteen percent drank minimally to moderately rarely to occasionally. 3. Only 7% developed an escalating heavy drinking pattern. 4. Five percent drank moderately over time. D. Predictors of post-LT alcohol use—predicted the time to onset of specific alcohol outcomes and the moderate to high drinking trajectories. 1. Diagnosis of AD was associated with a 2.8× greater likelihood of alcohol use. 2. Each month of pre-LT sobriety conferred a lesser risk to drink (21% less risk for each month sober). 3. Addiction rehabilitation was associated with a 2× greater likelihood to use alcohol. We interpreted this to mean that patients who required addiction rehabilitation in order to stop drinking before LT (compared with those who stopped on their own) had a more severe form of the addiction. 4. First-degree biologic relative with an alcohol use disorder was associated with a 1.5× greater risk. E. There was no specific clinical cutpoint for pre-LT length of sobriety that would have high sensitivity and specificity in determining those unlikely to drink. 1. Months of pre-LT sobriety conferred less risk in a linear fashion. 2. Similar to what is seen in the general AD population, the longer the sobriety, the less risk to drink. 3. In the general AD population, stable sobriety is measured in years, not months. F. Survival up to 7 years after LT was not different between groups based on drinking outcomes. Our survival data are comparable to United Network for Organ Sharing survival data. G. Causes of death. 1. For recurrent diseases, 48% of our cohort was infected with hepatitis B virus and/or HCV. Fifteen died of recurrent HCV, with a mean survival of 3.3 years. 2. Thirteen died of cancer; mean survival was 3.5 years. Seven cancer deaths were most likely from tobacco exposure (lung and throat cancers in smokers/chewers). 3. Five died of alcohol-related causes; mean survival was 4 years. A. AD LT recipients share the same general characteristics of those with AD in the general population. 1. We have patients with complex histories, early onset, family histories of AD, comorbid drug use, depression, and tobacco use histories. a. We are selecting patients for LT with long sobriety. b. In the general AD population, this represents only a small percentage: 20-35% who had AD for 10-20 years and were 1 year sober. c. Members of our cohort were more likely to have attended addiction rehabilitation before LT. B. Outcomes are very good. 1. Most (71%) were completely or nearly completely abstainers. 2. Only 12% returned to a pattern of repeated drinking (only 7% in the heaviest repeated pattern of use). Many of these patients sought help for their addiction. 3. Few died as the result of alcohol consumption. 4. Patients in our cohort were more likely to die of recurrent HCV or cancer. C. Suggest considering recruiting patients from the still alcohol-dependent population if they can. 1. Begin active addiction treatment. 2. Have adequate support (family and LT team) for ongoing addiction treatment. 3. Demonstrate abstinence. 4. Recall that 75% of AD population never get treatment for their addiction. We could improve the course of their AD and medical outcome by identifying these patients and referring them for assessment and addiction treatment.

      "abstract": "The functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are the most frequent clinical conditions seen in practice. Up to 60% of these patients is also suffering from psychosocial problems. Therefore it is important to define the patient's complaints in terms of a biopsychosocial disorder, to acknowledge the relevance of the psychosocial aspects and to provide an integrated psychosomatic treatment or a psychotherapy if indicated. Most of the research on psychotherapy in FGID to date has focused on the irritable bowel syndrome and different methods of treatments were studied (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, dynamic psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, and relaxation). Randomised controlled studies have shown that psychotherapy is superior to conventional medical therapy. Hypnotherapy is successful not only for irritable bowel syndrome but also for functional dyspepsia. Predictors of a positive response to psychological treatment generally are: (1) awareness that stress exacerbates their bowel symptoms, (2) at least mild anxiety or depression, (3) the predominant bowel symptom is abdominal pain or diarrhea and not constipation, (4) the abdominal pain waxes and wanes in response to eating, defecation, or stress rather than being constant pain, and 5) the symptoms are of relatively short duration. Benefits persist over years, and in the long run, clinic visits and health care costs can be reduced.",

      "title": "Los trastornos de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia",
      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. PMS has been shown to have negative impacts on a woman's subjective and psychological well-being, leading to changes in her activities, incompatibility in marriage, and inappropriate behaviour with children. PMS symptoms are divided into two categories: physical and psychological. Feeling burdened, prone to stress, difficulties concentrating, decreased social contact, loneliness, performance impairment, substance abuse, angry outbursts, and death wishes are all examples of psychological conditions.",

      "abstract": "Depression is often accompanied by a wide variety of somatic symptoms even when there is no evidence of any organic disorder that can cause such symptoms. Though the underlying mechanism still remains unclear, there are two assumptions explaining the associations between somatic symptoms and depression. One is that depression itself causes several somatic symptoms. That is, people with depression may express their mental conflicts in various somatic symptoms. This hypothesis could apply especially to those who have a vague feeling of stigma or prejudice against mental disorders, and who are reluctant to frankly express their mental symptoms. From another point of view, this might mean that some chronic somatic symptoms are magnified due to the person’s depressive state. Another possible hypothesis is that those who have had chronic somatic symptoms of unknown origin, in other words, functional somatic symptoms, are likely to be depressed since they cannot always receive effective medical treatment for such symptoms.",

      "title": "The epidemiology of pain in depression",
      "abstract": "Over 75% of depressed patients in primary care complain of painful physical symptoms such as headache, stomach pain, neck and back pain aswell as non-specific generalized pain. The presence of such symptoms predicts a greater severity and a less favourable outcome of depression with a poorer health-related quality of life. World Health Organization data obtained in primary care centres worldwide show that 22% of all primary care patients suffer from persistent debilitating pain and that these patients are four times more likely to have co-morbid anxiety or depressive disorder than pain-free primary care patients. Not unexpectedly, the risk of depression is greater when the pain is more diffuse, as indicated by the number of painful sites, and has a greater effect on the quality of life. Certain depressive symptoms, such as low energy and sleep disturbances, are commonly found in patients with co-morbid pain, whereas the opposite is true for symptoms such as guilt and loneliness. Increasingly, major depression is seen as being composed of psychological, somatic and painful physical symptoms. In order to achieve full sustained remission it is necessary to treat symptoms in all three of these areas. The area of painful physical symptoms is unfortunately still poorly understood and clearly merits greater attention. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Patients were divided into two groups depending on the form of alcohol abuse: 1) periodic (drunk), 2) permanent. Alcohol dependence with a drunken form of alcohol abuse was characterized by the presence of more than one spontaneous or socially conditioned remission (more than one month of sobriety) for a year, a short period of hard consumption of alcohol before the development of a psychotic disorder, a shorter period or no control period of consumption alcohol. On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse. In the case of a drunken form of alcohol abuse, more expressive vegetative signs of withdrawal syndrome (tachycardia, arterial hypertension, hyperhidrosis) were noted in the structure of the of alcoholic delirium. These patients had more expressive aff ective (mostly anxiety) and psychomotor agitation. Productive psychotic symptomatology (delusion, hallucinations) had a more signifi cant eff ect on the behavior of patients with a drunken form of alcohol abuse. In patients with permanent alcohol abuse, visual hallucinations were more often associated with tactile hallucinations. In this group, a prolongation of the psychotic disorder occurred more frequently due to the exacerbation of somatoneurological diseases, which often had at these patients.",

Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

      "title": "Got Stress? You May Be Harming Your Brain",
      "abstract": "Stress, is a concept that is borrowed from engineering and when too great a stress load is placed on a lawyer, he or she can suffer from damage or even collapse. Acute stress is short-lived and the body reacts to it by mobilizing resources to deal with intellectual or physical challenges. Chronic stress is long-lasting, persisting for many days or months, and results in serious physical and mental symptoms. The human response to stress is to engage the fight-or-flight system ensuring survival. This response was meant to address acute stress, lasting for short periods, to manage immediate predator threats. The endocrine system releases the stress hormones adrenalin and glucocorticoids (the preeminent glucocorticoid is cortisol), which elevate heart rate and blood pressure, slow digestion, and suppress immune responses. Chronic stress causes a lengthy stress response and the lawyer body and brain suffer.Long-term elevated levels of stress hormones can cause impaired immune response, increased appetite, decreased muscle mass, and increased mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and depression. If a lawyer spends too much time in fight-or-flight overdrive, his or her cognitive performance can also be impaired. Sitting deep in the lawyer brain and shaped like a pair of horns, one in the left hemisphere and one in the right, is the brain’s memory processor. The hippocampus is critical to the work of lawyers because it processes client facts, statutes, cases, and regulations, and facilitates their transfer into long-term memory. The hippocampus is one of a few places in the brain that can grow new brain cells in a process called neurogenesis. And it is extremely sensitive to stress.The impact of stress on cognition includes deterioration in memory, concentration, problem-solving, and language processing. Curiosity, creativity, and motivation are also diminished. These cognitive problems are likely due to stress hormones, which suppress neurogenesis, and cause neurodegeneration and cell death in the hippocampus. And the brain cells that remain do not function as well. Research using brain scans shows that hippocampi shrink in size in people who experience post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, and repeated jet lag. There is some good news about stress and brain health. Neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, the growth of new brain cells and the development of new brain networks, allow for healing the stressed lawyer brain. The prescription for optimal brain health is a combination of aerobic exercise, adequate sleep, and restorative practices. Any exercise that raises the lawyer’s heart rate increases blood and oxygen flow to the brain; elevates key neurotransmitters; and produces a brain cell building block called Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor. Research indicates that any amount of aerobic exercise improves brain function, but the more fit the body, the greater the brain resilience and cognitive capacity. Sufficient sleep is critical for consolidating memories, which happens largely during REM sleep cycles. Restorative practices such as mindfulness, meditation, gratitude, and yoga strengthen the rest-and-digest system and calm the fight-or-flight response. These practices can lower heart rate and blood pressure, improve digestion, strengthen the immune system, and reduce stress hormone levels.Lawyers know they need to take care of their physical health, but they also need to cultivate brain health. The brain-boosting benefits of exercise, adequate sleep, and restorative practices can rehabilitate the stressed lawyer brain.",

Pain has its meaning and is produced out of the complex interactions of body, mind, and culture. Pain can be interpreted differently from individual to individual depending on the time and place where that person is [1]. Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage [2]. Pain is described as acute or chronic. Acute pain is experienced for short time (two weeks) due to trauma while chronic pain last longer than three months and is associated with injury to tissues or nerves. There are four factors that commonly affect pain expressions: Location, Duration, Intensity and Etiology. The location is the place where the pain occurs. Duration is the time that pain lasts, and is classified as chronic or acute. Intensity tells how severe the pain is. It is usually measured through a pain scale from zero to ten. The patient's rate themselves. Usually, four to six is considered as a moderate level, and above seven is considered to be severe pain [3].",

The WHO tries to achieve homogeneity on the one hand by using similar exclusion criteria like those of DSM-IV (time factor, organic cause, etc.), but on the other by defining subgroups (see p. 7ff). The first way, the time factor, however, applied by the WHO is somewhat more complicated than that of the APA. The first time factor used by the WHO concerns the development of symptoms (the time-interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks). And the second factor, the duration of an episode, depends on the type of the subgroup: the total duration of the disorder in the subgroups with schizophrenic symptoms (F23.1: Acute Polymorphic Psychotic Disorders with Symptoms of Schizophrenia, F23.2: Acute Schizophrenia-like Psychotic Disorders) must not exceed 1 month. This is also valid for the unspecified type (F23.8).",

Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

However, chronic pain often can produce depression, anxiety, and marital difficulties. Although physical examination and other studies, including x-ray studies, 3D-CT, electromyelograms (EMG), nerve conduction velocity studies and MRI in many cases may document an organic basis of chronic back pain, some organic syndromes defy definition by objective tests. This may be a greater problem for women, where physician prejudice can result in a significantly less extensive evaluation of their complaints of back pain. Also, any litigation may influence symptoms and the type of litigation may influence outcomes [8]. Therefore, there is a need to differentiate between “organic” and “functional” (negative physical and laboratory examination) back pain.",

The clinical examination should define 1) vital functions, 2) depth of coma, 3) whether cerebral signs are diffuse or local, 4) any signs of organ disease. The blood sugar level must be determined. Hypoglycemia may be the cause even if the signs point to another cause. Head injury and intoxication/poisoning must always be considered, even if a medical cause is suspected. Prolonged coma calls for repeated clinical and laboratory examination. Combinations of causes, e.g. organ disease plus intoxication should be considered.",

      "abstract": "Stress can significantly affect an individual's mental and physical well-being. Acute stress response of the body is associated with activation of various organ systems, resulting in the release of cortisol and catecholamines. Acute stress response subsides on the resolution of the precipitating stimulus. The persistence of the precipitating stimulus results in chronic stress and burn-out. Longitudinal studies have shown that chronic stress can result in both mental and physical health outcomes. The mental health outcomes include depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorder etc. The physical health outcomes include effects on multiple organ systems. It is, therefore, essential to identify and rectify the precipitating factors to minimize the impact of stress on the human body. [ Psychiatr Ann . 2024;54(10):e272–e276.]",

      "title": "Double Syndromes:Autism Associated with Genetic, Medical and Metabolic Disorders",
      "abstract": "A number of conditions—genetic, metabolic, and medical syndromes—have a high rate (more than expected by chance; i.e., more than a few percent) or a very high rate (more than 20%) of several autism symptoms associated with them. In the presence of these syndromes, the diagnosis of autistic disorder or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is very often appropriate (Gillberg and Coleman 2000). These conditions are listed in Table 2.1. Some conditions, like Down syndrome, have a much lower rate of autistic symptoms than other of the listed syndromes, but, nonetheless, present a much higher rate than expected in the general population. A number of these syndromes are also discussed elsewhere in this volume, where the full range of cognitive and behavioral complications are addressed. Angelman syndrome is characterized by jerky movements, unprovoked laughter, and varying degrees of mental retardation, mostly severe or profound (Horsler and Oliver 2006). The rate of Angelman syndrome in the general population has been estimated at about 1 in 12,000 children, with a 1:1 male-to-female ratio (Steffenburg, Gillberg, Steffenburg, &amp; Kyllerman 1996). Angelman syndrome (formerly known as ‘happy puppet syndrome’) is usually caused by a deletion of chromosome 15q11.2–12, which is similar, but not identical, to that found in children with Prader-Willi syndrome and is maternally, rather than paternally, inherited. The deletion includes a gene for the β-3 subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (Saitoh et al. 1994). Sixty to 75% of patients have deletions or rearrangements in the long arm of chromosome 15, and the deletion is always on the maternal chromosome. A small proportion of cases have paternal disomy for chromosome 15. At least 20% of affected persons have normal chromosomes and no evidence of disomy. In some of these cases, recurrence in relatives may be observed. Such cases may be due to a dominant mutation of the UBE3 gene at 15q11–13 resulting in an Angelman phenotype only when transmitted by females. Differences in clinical presentation are related to the nature of the genetic defect (Lossie et al. 2001).",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden onset of psychosis in a patient for a duration of more than a day and less than a month. The DSM-5 defines brief psychotic disorder as a psychotic condition involving the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought processes, disorganized speech and/or behaviors. This condition can also be associated with impaired memory of recent events, screaming, mutism, outlandish dressing, or behaviors. Acute psychotic symptoms can be associated with emotional lability often triggered by substance abuse or severe and acute stress such as the loss of a loved one. Patients ultimately receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for a duration longer than six months. Brief psychotic disorder is often diagnosed in teenage patients, but it is less commonly seen in the females. Although the exact pathophysiology of brief psychotic disorder has not been determined, historically and similarly to schizophrenia it has been strongly linked to familial history. In some cases, it has been preceded by a traumatic and stressful event. Brief psychotic disorder has also been theorized to be the cause of maladaptive defense mechanism to escape a stressor. In this case report, we present a fifteen-year-old female patient who abruptly lost her mother to COVID-19, her adaptation few months following the loss and her eventual reactive psychosis as well as management challenges.",

Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Individual anxiety disorders have considerable symptomatic overlap in their expression. The life-time prevalence of all anxiety disorders in the general population is about 25%. There is familial aggregation of anxiety and mood disorders such as major depression. Genetic factors and life experiences both contribute to the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders. GAD is characterized by excessive anxiety and uncontrollable worry, is present for longer than 6 months, and tends to occur comorbidly with other conditions, including other anxiety disorders and major depression as well as general medical conditions. GAD, given its chronic nature, is associated with significant impairment. GAD is responsive to pharmacological treatments, such as anxiolytics and antidepressants, as well as psychotherapies such as cognitive therapy.",

Diese werden durch vegetative Symptome, Kribbelsensationen und tiefgründiges \"Ewigkeitsgefühl\" eingeleitet. Sie sind gefolgt von entweder spontaner Erholung oder - in einem Drittel der Anfälle - von kurzzeitigem vollständigem Bewusstseinsverlust. Mittels eines implantierten EKG-Recorders gelingt es, eine Asystolie von 15 Sekunden zu dokumentieren. Mit der Einlage eines Schrittmachers verschwinden die Bewusstseinsverlustepisoden, die Anfälle mit den vegetativen Sensationen und \"Ewigkeitsgefühl\" persistieren. Erst mit einer antiepileptischen Therapie wird eine Kontrolle der letzteren Symptome erzielt, wobei eine vollständige Symptomfreiheit bis heute nicht erreicht werden kann. Handelt es sich primär um eine Asystolie mit konsekutiver hypoxischer zerebraler Symptomatik oder tritt die Asystolie in Folge eines epileptischen Leidens auf? Die beiden Hypothesen zu diesem Fall werden diskutiert.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disorder with a wide range of changes in mental functions, primarily affectivity, and is manifested by dysphoric mood and reductive changes in cognitive, conative and other psychic dynamisms, with the presence of psychosomatic disorders and suicidal thoughts.There is always a triad of symptoms involved: alteration of affectivity, anhedonia and low energy with fatigue, but in it’s clinical picture there are other symptoms, such as guilt and powerlessness, obsession with “ black thoughts “ with loss of self – confidence, with hopelessness, loss of apetite, and weight loss with insomnia or hypersomnia present and more frequent thoughts of death because of worthlessness in life.Severe depressive disorder is not a homogenous mental disorder but a complex of clinical fenomena with subtypes, it is a series of special syndromes or clinical forms arranged continuously from lower to highest intensity of psychopathological clinical signs with or without psychoticisam to a high degree of risk for suicide. Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder. The presented data on a global level indicate that in the world and in the Balkan 7.5 % of patients are treated in hospital.

There is still no concrete explanation as to the onset of the disorder; it is considered that their presence tends to be more common in men than in women. Between possible triggers for schizophrenia it noted age of onset and genetic factors. The genetic risk for the disorder is not enough because approximately 60% of people with schizophrenia have no family history whatsoever. The environment unlike this factor demonstrates a higher weight. Classically they have divided into positive and negative symptoms. It must be remembered that not in all cases the same combination of symptoms occur as it is considered to schizophrenia as a heterogeneous disorder. The decrease in attention, memory or disturbances in executive functioning are also symptoms called cognitives, which can get to add to the traditional division of existing symptoms. These symptoms and signs should be continued for at least 6 months of persistence. To continue with the diagnosis, have to remember that persistence is the key to the process of psychological evaluation, and in this case that presents psychotic symptoms is recommended a regular contact with the patient.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ? Existent-t-ils et quelle est la valeur des outils diagnostiques moins contraignants comme par exemple l’agenda de sommeil, l’actimétrie ? Comment prendre en charge une insomnie dans un cadre psychiatrique ? Quel est le « bon usage » des hypnotiques ?

      "abstract": "As discussed in Chapter 1, for many young people, exacerbation of manic or depressive symptoms occurs through a spiral of contributing factors, both biological and psychosocial. Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

      "abstract": "Depression er en hyppigt forekommende psykisk lidelse, som forbindes med en lang række psykiske og fysiske symptomer. Disse symptomer kan påvirke dagligdagen i væsentlig grad og er typisk kendetegnet ved sænket stemningsleje, nedsat lyst eller interesse samt nedsat energi og øget trætbarhed. En stor andel af personer med en depressiv lidelse oplever ydermere udtalte vanskeligheder inden for det sociale domæne. For enkelte psykiatriske lidelser er sociale og interpersonelle vanskeligheder selvstændigt medregnet som et diagnostisk kriterium; fx inden for autismespektrumforstyrrelser. Dette er ikke tilfældet for depression, der ikke desto mindre ofte er kendetegnet ved betydelige og fremtrædende vanskeligheder inden for det samme domæne. Personer ramt af depression isolerer sig, oplever mindre glæde, og ofte udspiller der sig et større konfliktniveau i kontakten med deres nærmeste (Hirschfeld et al., 1999; Weightman, Knight, &amp; Baune, 2019). Den deprimerede persons sociale vanskeligheder er belastende i sig selv og øger samtidig risikoen for tab af social støtte, hvilket i sig selv kan udgøre en barriere for bedring i tilstanden. Det er bl.a. af disse grunde vigtigt at opnå indsigt i de kognitive mekanismer, der kan ligge til grund for hhv. adaptiv og maladaptiv social adfærd. Kognitiv svækkelse optræder typisk også i forbindelse med en depressiv episode, og talrige studier har dokumenteret vanskeligheder inden for en række kognitive domæner, herunder psykomotorisk tempo, opmærksomhed, hukommelse, indlæring og eksekutive funktioner (Rock, Roiser, Riedel, &amp; Blackwell, 2013). Socialkognitive vanskeligheder er anerkendt som et fremtrædende symptom ved en række psykiske lidelser, herunder autismespektrumforstyrrelser og skizofreni (Fernandes, Cajão, Lopes, Jerónimo, &amp; Barahona-Corrêa, 2018). I hvilket omfang samme type af deficits ligeledes er af betydning ved depression, har igennem en årrække stået mindre klart. Der er dog nu en voksende anerkendelse af socialkognition som et værdifuldt konstrukt i forståelsen af kognitive forstyrrelser ved depression og i forbindelse med velkendte psykosociale vanskeligheder ved samme. En introduktion til socialkognition vil blive givet i det følgende efterfulgt af en præsentation af fund inden for unipolar depressiv lidelse.",

They can be understood as a way to indicate suffering or to get attention and sometimes as a mean to regain self-esteem. There is little quantitative change in pain associated psychopathology and coping mechanisms in the elderly as compared to younger patients. However, qualitative changes are identified. The high degree of association between chronic pain and depression remains throughout the age span. However, age variations in the expression of psychological distress are to be noted. Elderly patients have a tendency to make a greater use of somatic complaints and avoid the expression of the emotional dimension of distress. This clinical particularity is discussed. Special attention should be paid to the multidimensional aspects of pain com- plaints in the elderly in order not to underestimate its affective components.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "To review current knowledge on blood pressure variability.Blood pressure variability has a time-course ranging from a few seconds or minutes (short-term variability) to 24 h (long-term variability) or 1 year (seasonal variations). The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Il est classique de dire que le deuil va entraîner des conséquences biopsychosociales. Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil. La prise en charge doit mettre le deuil au centre de la réflexion : – en traitant l’individu, en appréciant : ∘ la spécificité de son deuil : pré-deuil, deuil « blanc », deuil « non élaboré », deuil de l’enfant, de l’adolescent, de l’adulte, de la personne âgée voire très âgée, les circonstances de la mort du proche : mort d’un enfant, mort par suicide, par homicide, par accident survenant pendant un transport (voiture, train, bateau, etc.) après une catastrophe naturelle, si la mort est brutale et que la personne y a assisté ou si elle a failli elle-même mourir ; – en traitant le groupe : ∘ familial avec une approche transgénérationnelle, ∘ d’individus bénéficiant d’une prise en charge groupale : avec un même type d’endeuillés ou avec des endeuillés de causes différentes.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

In de somatische specialismen worden SOLK vaak gegroepeerd naar functionele syndromen: clusters van symptomen die vaak samen voorkomen. Binnen deze syndromen worden de zogenoemde grote drie onderscheiden, te weten chronischevermoeidheidssyndroom (CVS), fibromyalgiesyndroom (FMS) en prikkelbaredarmsyndroom (PDS). Deze worden gekenmerkt door de klachtenclusters vermoeidheid, chronische pijn van het bewegingsapparaat en maag-darmklachten. SOLK zijn geassocieerd met beperkingen in kwaliteit van leven, werkgerelateerde beperkingen, en gestegen ziektekosten. Huisartsen en POH'S-GGZ vinden het vaak lastig om SOLK-patienten te behandelen, terwijl patienten zich niet altijd gehoord voelen. De geloofwaardigheid van beiden staat op het spel: die van de huisarts en POH-GGZ, omdat zij niet in staat zijn de oorzaak van de klachten te ontdekken, en die van de patient, omdat de symptomen niet geobjectiveerd kunnen worden. Dit zet de relatie van patient en huisarts/POH-GGZ onder druk, en kan het herstel belemmeren. De huisartsenpraktijk is echter bij uitstek de plek om SOLK vroegtijdig te herkennen en op een biopsychosociale manier te benaderen. Het doel van deze nascholing is de POH-GGZ in deze functie te versterken.",

Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning.

      "title": "Prolonged Stress Leads to Serious Health Problems: Preventive Approaches.",
      "abstract": "Â  Â  Â As long as humans have been around, there has been stress. Stress is well known fact involved significantly in the onset of almost all major depressive disorders. Moreover, prolonged stress in humans caused serious neurological disorders, cardiac problems (including heart attack), gastric ulcers, asthma, diabetes, headaches, accelerated aging and premature death. (1-4) Stress is basically of two types: Acute and chronic stress, which has also been well defined in animal models. (5-8) Acute stress results from specific events or situations that involve novelty, a threat to ego which leave the people in a poor sense of control. Importantly, sometimes this stress can be good also as it keeps individuals alert, motivated and primed to respond. This happens due to the release of stress-induced hormones, which help the individuals to deal with the situation. (6,7) On the other hand chronic stress, which can be occurred by repeated exposure of the situation. This stress has been linked to major neurological disorders, heart diseases, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes etc. Now it is well documented that up to 70% of serious diseased populations are believed to be effected by chronic stress. (1-4) Therefore, proper chronic stress management takes on great importance given the wide range of bodily systems impacted by stress hormones. The response against stress involves a complex signaling pathway among neurons and somatic cells. (9,10) Besides these, stress also exerts detrimental effects on cell functions through impairment of oxidant-antioxidant homeostasis leading to oxidative cellular damage and altering monoaminergic response, which play critical role in almost 80% of human disorders including neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. (9-14) While understanding of the chemical interactions underlying the stress response has increased vastly in recent years, much remains poorly understood. In response to chronic stress, two types of responses are reported, physiological and psychological, which are mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathoadrenergic and brain monoaminergic systems, that subsequently leads to behavioral, physiological and neurobiological changes. (9-14) Moreover duration and nature of an applied stressor are also important determinants to know whether adaptation to the stress response acts as being protective or damaging. (15) Direct intervention on neurotransmitters might be beneficial as augmentation strategies for the treatment of stress-induced disorders. But various preliminary stress coping strategies should be followed to avoid becoming a depression patient. The research area focuses on improved understanding of how stress-related illnesses and health problems arise and can be prevented in and outside of the workplace. (15, 16) Despite a wide range of strategies and different categorizations for anti-stress approaches, two main categorizations are mentioned almost universally: Coping Response to Emotion (or Emotion Focused Coping) and Coping Response to Problems (or Problem Focused Coping). (15, 16) Coping Response to Emotion can be achieved by performing the following well defined approaches: (i) Trying to reduce the negative emotional responses associated with stress such as embarrassment, fear, anxiety, depression, excitement and frustration. (ii) Keeping busy to take the mind off from the issue. (iii) Emotional disclosure, which involves expressing strong emotions by talking or writing about negative events. (iv) Cognitive reappraisal, it involves the cognitive modulations to construing a potentially emotion-eliciting situation in a way that changes its emotional impact.

(15,16) Â Â Â Â  In my opinion, both coping approaches are effective in the specific circumstances. When choosing an effective coping strategy, one must take into account the changeability of the stressor, the individualâ€™s reaction to the stressor, and the adaptability of the individualâ€™s capacity through changeable physiological responses. In short, providing individuals with appropriate adaptive coping skills can reduce negative health outcomes and increase the ability to manage ongoing stress. The good news is that stress levels depends on our own behavior and decisions and that we can optimize our bodiesâ€™ responses to stress based on how we live our daily lives.",

      "title": "Xerostomia and Hyposalivation in Patients with Physical and Psychological Disabilities",
      "abstract": "Disabilities are complex, dynamic, multidimensional and also contested; one or more key functions of the organism can be affected so to diminish an individual�s freedom of expression and of action. The transition from an individual, medical perspective to a structural, social perspective was described as a shift from a medical model to a social model where individuals are more likely considered disabled by the society then by their own bodies. Disabilities represent a part of the human condition due to its bidirectional connection with poverty: the existence of disabilities can increase the risk of poverty, and poverty can increase the risk of disability. The experience of disability that results from the interaction of the state of health, personal factors and environmental factors varies greatly. Stress, anxiety or different unpleasant moments can cause a temporary decrease in salivary flow but a constant decrease can indicate the existence of a serious health problem. Xerostomia represents the subjective sensation of dry mouth. It can be accompanied by hyposalivation, an objective phenomenon but this is not always the case. Even if the patient declares the existence of xerostomia, this does not necessarily imply the existence of hyposalivation. Xerostomia can be determined by modifications in the oral cavity, as the sensitivity level to moistening, adverse reactions to certain drugs (anti-depressants, inhibitors of the conversion enzyme). The handicap, now called disability represents a special condition of the individual, reason why he must benefit of the support of the society and of those around him. Dental treatment in patients with psychiatric disabilities must consider the general and local involutive modifications, the existent overlay polypathologies that can influence the dental treatment. The study was conducted practically and included the direct interaction as part of the medical team and the registration of 145 patients presented on request with various types of psychological disorders, sometimes covered by the mask of somatic disorders, indicating a masked depression, or a physical depression, where the emotional condition of yesterday and today differ very much. Pointing out the role of the dentist in approaching patients with physical and psychical disabilities, motivating and making them aware of the necessity of adopting a proper oral hygiene for preventing oral disorders. The dramatic impact on the psyche and the well-chosen words stressed by the clinician increase patient awareness and motivation in order to make him collaborate during the treatment.",

      "title": "Clinical progress note: Management of somatic symptom and related disorders in pediatric inpatients",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptoms affect nearly 1 in 10 children each day and account for a rising number of pediatric hospitalizations.1, 2 In fact, the severity of these somatic symptoms is often greater in hospitalized settings, where nearly half are neurologic and frequently involve pain or disordered gut–brain interactions.3, 4 Other common somatic symptoms include fatigue, faintness, and nausea.2 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5th edition introduced somatic symptom and related disorders (SSRDs) as a new category with persistent, impairing symptoms. This category includes somatic symptom disorder (includes a pain specifier), functional neurologic symptom disorder or conversion disorder, and illness anxiety disorder.5 The wide range of somatic symptomatology spans subspecialty services (Table 1). SSRDs have a substantial impact on the healthcare system, accounting for 20% of U.S. healthcare expenditures.1 Pediatric SSRDs are associated with prolonged hospitalization, family and provider dissatisfaction, and excessive resource utilization.6, 7 This includes diagnostic testing, overuse of pain medication, frequent acute care utilization, and most significantly, an estimated 37.7% readmission rate within 1 year.6-8 Mean index hospitalization duration after SSRD diagnosis rises with patient age, from 6.9 days in school-age youth to 11.5 days in young adults.8 Limited literature comparing pediatric and adult SSRDs suggests that visceral hyperalgesia in functional abdominal pain is influenced by early life events and often leads to disability.4 Somatization disorders also contribute to downstream resource use via their association with increased risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, independent of comorbid mental health disorders.9 Unfortunately, inconsistent management of SSRDs may endanger patient outcomes and quality of care. In fact, patients of families who fully accepted the diagnosis demonstrated a greater likelihood of accepting post-discharge counseling, a nearly 20-fold greater complete recovery rate (odds ratio 17.36), and significantly lower readmission rate (odds ratio 0.083) compared to those whose families rejected or only partially accepted the diagnosis.3 We summarize the current literature regarding inpatient pediatric management of SSRDs, highlighting evidence-based steps in the identification, evaluation, and management of this population. Following a PubMed database search in January 2022 that included permutations of terms \"somatic symptom,\" \"pediatric,\" \"pathway,\" and \"functional,\" studies were selected for inclusion based on applicability to pediatric inpatient management. The terminology used to describe somatic symptoms has evolved over time. While references to \"hysterical\" symptoms are typically recognized as antiquated and inappropriate, the term remains in diagnostic coding and occasionally arises in clinical descriptions. The terms \"pseudo\" and \"psychogenic\" also carry negative connotations. Diagnostic labels notably influence caregiver decision-making for children with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), such that those who were informed that their child had psychogenic or pseudo seizures were less open to behavioral treatments and more likely to seek a second opinion compared with those informed of functional seizures or nonepileptic events.10 More recently, the term \"functional\" has risen to favor as it describes symptoms due to problems with body system functioning rather than structure. Disorders of gut–brain interaction (DGBI) is also a newer umbrella term for somatic gastrointestinal conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, rumination, visceral hyperalgesia, functional abdominal pain, functional dyspepsia, and cyclic vomiting.4 A growing number of North American institutions over the past several years have developed and implemented clinical pathways to address and standardize care for those with suspected SSRDs.1, 7, 11 Clinical pathways are an evidence-based means shown to help improve consistency, safety, and efficacy of patient care, and have been associated with decreases in hospital length of stay, in-hospital complications, and costs.6, 12 Giudice et al. described an SSRD clinical pathway implemented in a children's hospital that begins by identifying patients with suspected SSRDs (mostly neurologic symptoms) in the emergency department, including example provider language.7 If specific admission criteria are met, initial inpatient management emphasizes early involvement of subspecialists, including psychiatry, other relevant medical subspecialties, ancillary support, and an electronic functional plan order set that promotes daily mobility and sleep hygiene. Once that initial process is complete, an interdisciplinary provider meeting is held in which different subspecialties form an integrated diagnosis and plan based on their compiled expertise, which is presented to the family and sets the tone for the hospitalization and discharge plan. (In contrast, multidisciplinary care reflects subspecialists working together in a less integrated, more individual mindset).7 Ibeziako et al. outlined steps to develop a standardized care pathway for hospitalized pediatric patients with suspected SSRDs.11 This geographically diverse working group of pediatric consultation-liaison psychiatrists identified key steps that emphasize similar concepts to Giudice and colleagues7, 11 The pathway's first step emphasizes early recognition of somatic symptoms, including inconsistencies in the history or physical exam. Suspected somatic symptoms trigger an interdisciplinary stepwise approach, beginning with an early concurrent diagnostic assessment of both physical and mental etiologies, then a discussion of findings, diagnosis, and management in an interdisciplinary provider meeting. The diagnosis and plan are then reviewed together with the patient and family during what is termed an \"informing family meeting.\" The remainder of inpatient management and discharge planning encompasses input from each member of the interdisciplinary team, with ongoing psychoeducation, demedicalization of medical problems, and incorporation of rehabilitation services as appropriate.11 Kullgren et al. describe a single-site institutional protocol and clinical practice guideline for SSRDs in inpatient pediatric medical settings.1 This protocol similarly emphasizes multidisciplinary care, collaborative communication, and ongoing evaluation. Their study population comprised 36 patients ages 8–17 years, most with neurologic or pain-related symptoms, half with a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, and a mean length of stay of 5.44 days. Like the aforementioned pathways, their protocol underscored early identification of suspected SSRD diagnoses in the emergency department and involved subspecialty involvement in deciding whether the patient met admission criteria. Of note, core inpatient consultations included psychology (for psychotherapeutic approach/framing) and child life (individuals certified in developmentally appropriate interventions to help children/families cope with hospitalization/illness-related challenges). Additional consults considered include psychiatry (to address medication management, interplay of medical comorbidities), social work (to provide additional psychosocial support/resources), and/or physical and occupational therapy, within 24 h of admission. Following subspecialty evaluations, a multidisciplinary provider meeting is focused on diagnostic consensus and discharge planning, and then the medical care and mental health team jointly discuss the diagnosis and management with the family.1 SSRD Clinical Pathway implementation reduced mean individual emergency room costs by $6,075 and inpatient healthcare costs by $51,433, concomitant with reduced length of stay and fewer subspecialty consults.6 A complete biopsychosocial workup, including medical, psychiatric, and social assessments. Informing the family of the diagnosis, conceptualization, and treatment recommendations. Providing targeted, brief interventions, including coping skills/exercises, a schedule and return to school plan. Facilitating outpatient treatment, including arranging for medical, psychological, and therapy services. Addressing the continuum of care beyond acute hospitalization during discharge planning is critical. This should be framed in the context of the biopsychosocial model, with emphasis on effective communication, clinician–patient relationship, and early patient education.4 Without any FDA-approved medications, supplements or recommended dietary modifications to date, the most evidence-based intervention for pediatric SSRDs remains cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).4 Typically completed in the outpatient setting, CBT confers short- and long-term benefits on quality of life, and social and school performance.4 One German study also suggested potential inpatient CBT benefits by assessing 60 youth (mean age 14.4 years, 56.7% female) who received inpatient multidisciplinary SSRD CBT-based treatment for a mean of 48 days, including psychotherapy, parental psychoeducation, physiotherapy, and social competence training. Half of the participants also received medication for comorbid depression or anxiety (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (methylphenidate or atomoxetine).2 Results showed improved levels of discomfort, anxiety, depression, and pain coping strategies at discharge and 6-month follow-up, and greater school attendance rates after treatment.2 CBT is thus recommended for SSRD treatment regardless of the setting of implementation. Spanning several pediatric institutions, these SSRD clinical pathways highlight several common themes, summarized in Figure 1. Each pathway emphasizes the early involvement of relevant subspecialists, including psychiatry/psychology, social work, medical subspecialists, child life, and physical and occupational therapy. All pathways emphasize the importance of an interdisciplinary provider meeting followed by a family meeting, to ensure consistent diagnoses and language, as well as an interdisciplinary management and discharge plan. Evidence also specifically supports CBT-based programming, whether inpatient or outpatient. The importance of such interdisciplinary efforts is further supported by a subsequent study showing a greater length of stay for patients with SSRDs admitted on a weekend compared to weekdays, suspected to be a result of limited weekend multidisciplinary care availability.14 Creating an SSRD-informed care culture involves educating providers on appropriate diagnosis and terminology, minimizing dualistic attitudes toward somatic symptoms, and practicing a multidisciplinary approach to care.15 Given the limited and relatively recent implementation of SSRD clinical pathways, future studies may focus on the longer-term impact of these pathways and their components on healthcare cost and resources, patient and provider experience, and generalizability to institutions with less robust subspeciality availability. Piloting CBT initiation at the time of diagnosis or during the acute inpatient stay, if feasible, may also be of interest to overcome bottlenecks in outpatient care.2 Such endeavors may lend compelling support for greater focus and practice standardization in this area. Published clinical pathways for SSRDs consistently emphasize early identification of symptoms and early involvement of subspecialists, including behavioral health, medical subspecialties, rehabilitation therapies, child life, and other relevant services dependent upon institutional availability. An interdisciplinary provider meeting then establishes a unified diagnosis and language, subsequently reviewed in a family informing meeting. This is followed by ongoing collaborative inpatient management and discharge planning. The evidence thus far suggests that implementation of a standardized and interdisciplinary approach to patients with SSRDs can significantly improve patient outcomes, as well as reduce health care costs and length of stay. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate long-term outcomes, as well as the generalizability to other settings with less subspecialty availability. The authors declare no conflict of interest.",

      "title": "Etiology of Depression in Children.",
      "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is experienced by a significant proportion of youth today, occurring at an earlier age than found in previous generations. Major Depressive Disorder can produce long-lasting detrimental effects on a child's life, which raises the question of etiology. Three areas were examined for evidence identifying specific determinants of Major Depressive Disorder in youth: biological factors, including studies on inherited characteristics; psychological factors, focusing on cognitive and affective activity; and environmental factors, such as stressful life events. The implications of the findings were then explored. ********** The term depression is often used to describe the temporary sadness, loneliness or blues that almost everyone feels from time to time. However, the DSM-IV TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revised) defines Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a mental illness in which a person consistently experiences deep, unshakable sadness and diminished interest in all activities for a period of at least 2 weeks. Major Depressive Disorder dramatically impairs an individual's ability to function in one or more areas of his or her life. Persons with MDD usually experience feelings of despair, hopelessness, worthlessness, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and sometimes thoughts of committing suicide. Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses. Although depression has long been a diagnosis made for adults, it has become increasingly prevalent in the youth of today. Mental health practitioners are seeing a marked increase in the number of youth who are experiencing depression at an earlier age than did previous generations (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Depressive symptoms and disorder are found in a significant proportion of young people, with long-lasting detrimental effects (Rice, Harold and Thapar, January, 2002). Major Depressive Disorder, having such a definitive impact on a child's life, raises the question of etiology. Three major areas will be explored as to the cause of depression in children, including biological factors, psychological factors and environmental factors. Some depressions seem to occur suddenly, even when life appears to be going very well. Others have an obvious external cause such as a relationship conflict, financial difficulty or some personal failure. Yet many individuals experiencing these problems do not become depressed. In an attempt to identify causal factors, it has been hypothesized that depression results from the interaction between a person's biological and psychological vulnerabilities and a stressful life event (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Biological Factors Depression has been found to run in families (Rice, Harold, Thapar, November, 2002). By studying twins, researchers have found evidence of a strong genetic influence in depression. Genetically identical twins raised in the same environment are three times more likely to both have major depressive disorder than are fraternal twins, who have only about half their genes in common. In addition, identical twins are five times more likely to have bipolar disorder in common. Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating manic and depressive mood swings. These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression can be inherited. Adoption studies have found that children of depression are vulnerable to depression even when raised by adoptive parents, offering more evidence of a genetic role in depression. A consensus that Major Depressive Disorder is both familial and inheritable is evident in the findings from both twin and family studies (Rice et al., January 2002). Family studies of early onset Major Depressive Disorder can be differentiated by the research methodology utilized (Scourfield, Rice, Thapar, Harold, Martin and McGuffin, 2003). Bottom-up studies evaluate the inheritability of Major Depressive Disorder by examining the child and working back through the child's ancestry. …",

A high percentage of patients with advanced cancer suffer debilitating fatigue that has a severe and profound impact on their lives. Fatigue may be caused or exacerbated by numerous factors, including the disease itself and its treatment, or multiple other interrelating symptoms such as dyspnoea, cachexia, anaemia and psychological distress. Continuous assessment of fatigue is a critical component of care for the patient with this debilitating symptom. Initial assessment should incorporate a detailed description of the patient’s fatigue history, its development, symptoms of the condition and any potential causes. Individualised management strategies that may include a combination of interventions can be administered to meet the specific needs of each patient.

These physical complaints are not consistent with the clinical picture of known, verifiable, conventionally defined diseases, and are unsupported by clinical or paraclinical findings. The phenomenon of medically unexplained symptoms cannot simply be classified into one or a few diagnostic categories, but must be regarded as an expression of a basic mechanism by which people may respond to stressors as in the cases of depression and anxiety. Somatization disorder and related disorders must thus be considered to possess a spectrum of severity. In this chapter, the focus will be on the chronic and multisymptomatic forms.",

      "abstract": "In the modern conditions of the development of sports, a great place is given to the impact of stress on the athlete's body. During preparation for competitions of various levels, the Olympic Games, world championships, continental championships, city competitions, athletes are \"accompanied\" by mental and emotional tension. Accordingly, when being in a given state of stress, corresponding negative disturbances appear in the performed sports activity. In general, stress is a fairly common and common phenomenon. Minor stresses are inevitable and harmless, but excessive stress creates problems for both individuals and organizations in accomplishing tasks. Psychologists believe that a person suffers more and more often from insults inflicted on him, a sense of his own insecurity, uncertainty about the future. There are two main groups of stress factors that most significantly affect the results of sports activities and are most often encountered: pre-competitive and competitive. Competitive stressors are stressors related directly to the sporting situation the athlete finds themselves in. Essentially, they are the most obvious stressors and are most directly linked to what happens during training or in a game. Organizational stressors can be attributed to, and therefore solved by, the coaching and organizational set up surrounding a team. The athlete needs to be helped to identify actions aimed at improving performance. Success in reaching sports peaks depends on the individual psychological characteristics of the athlete, and certain types of sports make demands and at the same time form personal qualities that are necessary for successful competitive activities. Each athlete is different, and their response to these competitive stressors will vary too. Finding the sweet spot where these stressors are contributing to an engaged, locked-in mindset can be the difference come crunch time. Knowing when a competitive stressor is overwhelming an athlete and having a detrimental affect can be an important preventative measure to avoid further issues down the road.",

Studies of both supposedly acute stress (life events) and chronic stress in life or work must increasingly be designed to distinguish between stress which is sustained or chronic over a period of yean or even decades, and hence capable of causing a serious chronic disease, and brief or transient stress, which may produce transient or brief psychological or physiological disturbances but cannot generate major chronic disease. Prospective studies are needed which collect measures of both stress and health or disease at multiple points over an extended period of time. Measures of stress should focus more on affect (for example, feelings of pressure and tension) than on cognition (for example feelings of satisfaction). Limited existing evidence is consistent with these ideals.",

Evidence is growing that enhanced control at work can be an important element in employees' health and well–being. These relationships can be understood in the context of the control–stress model.",

Anxiety sensitivityAnxiety sensitivity (AS) refers to individual differences in the fear of anxietyrelated sensations and the expectation that such sensations can have harmful consequences (Reiss, 1997;Reiss & McNally, 1985).Just as some people are afraid of spiders, some individuals fear the sensations that accompany anxiety.This construct AS can be measured with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) (Peterson & Reiss, 1992;Reiss, Peterson, Gursky, & McNally, 1986).AS has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders, specifically PD (Reiss, 1991).Besides AS, trait anxiety is also regarded as a vulnerability factor for the de- Chapter 2Reactivity to a 35% CO2 challenge in healthy first-degree relatives of patients with panic disorder Background: The effects of a 35% CO2 challenge were examined in healthy firstdegree relatives of panic disorder patients and in healthy control subjects matched for age and gender.Methods: One single inhalation of a 35% CO2 / 65% O2 challenge was administered to 50 first-degree relatives of panic disorder patients and 50 control subjects.Results: The first-degree relatives were more reactive to the 35% CO2 challenge than the control subjects.Conclusions: These findings indicate that being a member of a family with a panic disorder patient is, in itself, an important factor in CO2 hypersensitivity among subjects who have never experienced a panic attack.Both panic disorder patients and their first-degree relatives have a tendency to be more reactive to the CO2 challenge.van Beek, N., & Griez, E.

      "abstract": "![][1]</img> This article is part of a new initiative in Evidence-based Mental Health, namely the serialisation of chapters of Clinical Evidence (a summary of the best available evidence on common clinical interventions updated regularly by the BMJ Publishing Group). This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting. RÉSUMÉ Six cas de céphalées paroxystiques chez l'enfant, provenant de troubles comitiaux sont présentés. L'allure clinique des cephalées critiques présente les caractères suivants: elles sont habituellement diffuses ou bi‐frontales, elles commencent brutalement à n'importe quel moment et durent de quelques minutes à plusieurs heures. Dans la majorité des cas, elles sont accompagnées de nausées et de vomissements et suivies d'une léthargie post‐critique ou de sommeil; il n'y a pas de facteurs annonciateurs; les médications anticomitiales sont actives. Les facteurs qui différencient céphalées critiques et migraines sont discutés. Les céphalées critiques peuvent être la seule manifestation clinique de foyer comitial dans le système limbique et les autres parties du cortex. Quelques sujets présentent d'autres manifestations végétatives telles que pâleurs et douleurs abdominales. Presque tous ont des nausées et des vomissements. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Es wird über sechs Kinder mit paroxysmalen Kopfschmerzen infolge eines Krampfleidens berichtet. Das klinische Bild der Krampf‐Kopfschmerzen bietet folgende charakteristischen Befunde: Die Schmerzen sind gewöhnlich diffus oder bifrontal, sie beginnen abrupt, können zu jeder Zeit auftreten und dauern Minuten bis einige Stunden an. In der Mehrzahl der Fälle klagen die Patienten über Übelkeit, erbrechen und fallen anschliessend in einen postiktalen Dämmerzustand oder Schlaf; es gibt keine ursächlichen Faktoren; die Kopfschmerzen sprechen auf die Behandlung mit Antikonvulsiva an. Auf die unterschiedlichen Befunde bei krampfbedingten Kopfschmerzen und bei Migräne wird ausführlich eingegangen. Krampfebedingte Kopfschmerzen können die einzige klinische Manifestation von Krampffoci im limbischen System und anderen Teilen des Cortex sein. Bei einigen Patienten treten auch andere vegetative Symptome wie Blässe und Bauchschmerzen auf. Nahezu alle Kinder Klagen über Übelkeit und Erbrechen. RESUMEN Se aportan seis casos de niños con cefaleas paroxísticas a consecuencia de enfermedades con crisis agudas. El cuadro clínico de los ataques de cefalea incluye los datos siguientes: son por lo general difusas o bifrontales; empiezan abruptamente en cualquier momento y duran desde minutos a varias horas; en la mayoría de los casos se acompañan de nauseas y vómitos y se siguen de letargia postictal y sueño; no existen factores desencadenantes y responde a los anticonvulsilantes. Se discuten los factores diferenciales entre la crisis de cefalea y la migraña. Los ataques de cefalea pueden ser la única manifestación de crisis focales en el sistema límbico y otros puntos del córtex. Algunos de estos pacientes pueden tener otros fenómenos vegetativos tales como palidez y dolor abdominal; casi todos tíenen nauseas y vómitos.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Obsessive compulsive disorder is a severe and disabling clinical condition that usually arises in late adolescence or early adulthood and, if left untreated, has a chronic course. Objectives To report and discuss a clinical case, followed by the authors. Aims/Methods Consultation of the patient's medical file, serial clinical evaluations and scientific literature review. Results 33 years-old male, married, degree in economics. Observed in the emergency room for having thoughts dominated by ideas of obsessive content, with a sense of self-reference, associated with recurrent compulsions as cleaning and checking rituals, consequential high levels of hopelessness and a depressive mood, with jeopardized chronobiological rhythms. This clinical condition started seven years before and seriously undermined the patient’s autonomy. Some of the difficulties outlined by the patient are: on his way to and from work, whenever he passed by a crosswalk he would circle the following roundabout several times, to confirm that he hadn't run over any pedestrian; at the end of the day, he would go through the same path in reverse, by bicycle, to confirm that no pedestrians had been run over by him. After two years of psychopharmacological and cognitive-behavioral therapy the patient showed significant clinical improvement. Conclusions On this case, the most likely diagnosis is an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The particularity of this case lays on its severity, given its evolution period, the psychopathological richness demonstrated and the functional commitment of the patient; and in the significant clinical improvements observed, largely due to optimal patient adherence to treatment.",

Although the symptoms that are associated with this type of depression are fewer and less severe than those that are associated with major depression, they can still seriously reduce the quality of life for anyone who suffers from it. In some cases it will lead to end of life also. Over the long term, these symptoms can negatively impact normal functioning as much as major depression.",

Several lines of evidence suggest that these syndromes relate to neurobiological differences. We examined the relationship of these three syndromes to neurological signs.The relationships among the subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale and hallucinations/delusions, disorganization, and the deficit syndrome were examined in 83 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients with the deficit syndrome have enduring, idiopathic (or primary) negative symptoms.Each of the three syndromes had a distinctive pattern of relationships to neurological signs. Disorganization was significantly related to the total score on the Neurological Evaluation Scale, to sensory integration, and to the sequencing of complex motor acts. The deficit syndrome was significantly related to sensory integration only. Neither hallucinations/delusions nor a continuous measure of negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (that measured both primary and secondary negative symptoms, as well as enduring and transient symptoms) was related to any of the Neurological Evaluation Scale subscales or total score. Drug treatment was not related to neurological impairment.The results further support the neurobiological significance of the three clinical syndromes of schizophrenia. Ratings on a scale measuring negative symptoms appear to be less sensitive to neurobiological correlates than is the categorization of the presence or absence of the deficit syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 2.6% among U.S. adults, yet often goes unrecognized. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), BED is defined by recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating in a discrete period of time an amount of food larger than most people would eat in a similar amount of time under similar circumstances and a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode), occurring on average at least once a week for 3 months, and associated with marked distress. It can affect both men and women, regardless if they are at normal weight, overweight, or obese, and regardless of their ethnic or racial group. Psychiatric comorbidities are very common, with 79% of adults with BED also experiencing anxiety disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, or substance use disorders; almost 50% of persons with BED have ≥ 3 psychiatric comorbidities. Multiple neurobiological explanations have been proffered for BED, including dysregulation in reward center and impulse control circuitry, with potentially related disturbances in dopamine neurotransmission and endogenous μ-opioid signaling. Additionally, there is interplay between genetic influences and environmental stressors. Psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral interventions have been recommended as first line and are supported by meta-analytic reviews. Unfortunately, routine medication treatments for anxiety and depression do not necessarily ameliorate the symptoms of BED; however, at present, there is one approved agent for the treatment of moderate to severe BED-lisdexamfetamine, a stimulant that was originally approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",

      "title": "Effect of optimism/pessimism attitude on depression and coping strategies",
      "abstract": "Depression is a word used by mental health professional to refer an illness or group of illness called mood disorder. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. It's impossible to escape life's ups and downs. Feeling unhappy or sad in response to disappointment, loss, frustration or a medical condition is normal. Many people use the word to explain these kinds of feelings, but that is really situational depression, which is a normal reaction to events around us. Clinical depression, though, overwhelms and engulfs your day to day life, interfering with your ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and have fun. It is unrelenting, with little if any relief. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for an extended period of it.There is a difference, however, between a normal grief reaction and one that is disabling or unrelenting. While there's no set timetable for grieving, if it doesn't let up over time or extinguishes all signs of joy laughing at a good joke, brightening in response to a hug, appreciating a beautiful sunsetit may be depression. Brown and Haris (1978) reported that depression increases with the age due to several factors of day today life like burden of responsibility, sleeping problems, declining health etc.Coping strategies refer to the specific efforts, both behavioral and psychological, that people employ to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize stressful events.There are many different ways of coping but they all involve making some change in input-output relationships. Thus some methods of coping involve changing, controlling and even avoiding certain inputs, whether the problem is attacked by working on inputs that in internal processes or outputs, it will be one of the two major ways of adjustingdefensive coping or direct coping. Defensive coping involves protecting oneself by getting away from threatening inputs. Direct coping involves meeting challenges head on. Coping with stress may begin with the occurrence of a stressful even, during exposure to stressor and finally after it has taken places. However, successful coping with stress should depend on a number of factors such as individual attitude, perception of life stress and suffering and personal skills, capability of problem solving and decision making. Raju, Rohini, and Naga (2008) revealed that among the old age people 21.3% of them were severely depressed and diabetes is experienced mostly by the elderly whose age is between 70-80 years. The severely depressed older adults were suffering with blood pressure and asthma. The mildly depressed older adult's experiences suicidal tendencies, hearing problems, loneliness, diabetes and problem with the eyes.Sahu, (2007) found gender differences on life stress and significant negative relationship between life stress and coping was observed. It was also extended for males but this relationship was not found significant for females. Folkman, S. and Lazarus, R.S (1980) evaluated age difference in the use of problem focused coping and emotion focused coping among individuals aged 45 to 64. The younger group was found to use emotion focused approach more i.e. they used more of accepting responsibility, distancing more than o lder group.Considering the above facts the present study was undertaken to observe the Optimists and Pessimists on Depression and Coping strategies.Hypotheses of the studyTo achieve the main objective of the study following hypothesis are framed;* Optimists will have significantly low level of Depression as compared to Pessimists and its dimensions.* Optimists and pessimists will differ significantly on the tendency of using Coping Strategies and its dimensions.MethodParticipantsThe total sample was consisted of 255 optimists and 191 pessimists subjects. …",

It only involves some peculiar sensori-motor symptoms that occur for a short period of the day and do not even occur every day. So why bother treating the disorder? The clinically significant morbidity of RLS involves its disruption of quality of life (QoL) more than any of its specific symptom features. RLS patients complain of sleep disruption (1) and sensory problems involving pain and discomfort (2). They may have some possible cognitive impairments (3). The first two of these clinical features, however, represent the large majority of patient complaints. In a large survey of the general population in the United States, those with moderate to severe RLS symptoms reported two types of major complaints: discomfort and pain for 88% and sleep disturbance for 76% (4). But such complaints, even when dramatic, may not be clinically significant. What indication do we have that these symptoms reported by RLS patients adversely affect normal living, thereby justifying considerable treatment efforts? Health-related QoL studies address this critical question of the clinical significance of disease-related complaints. RLS is not known to shorten life but does it significantly disrupt life? The answer for this question comes best from the QoL evaluations.",

      "abstract": "Kleine-Levin syndrome appears suddenly, sometimes without a triggering factor or sometimes being precipitated by an infection (38.2%), head trauma (9%) or acute consumption of alcohol (5.4%) [2-5]. The etiology remains unclear, but there may be a genetic predisposition (haplotype HLA-DR1), associated with environmental factors [6,7]. The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

      "title": "Estudio de la eficacia de un tratamiento psicológico breve en la disminución de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "El trastorno de panico se define como un trastorno en el que los ataques de panico presentan de forma inesperada y recurrente y al menos uno de ellos va seguido de un minimo de un mes de inquietud o preocupacion persistente por la aparicion de nuevas crisis o sus consecuencias, y/o por un cambio significativo y desadaptativo en el comportamiento que se relaciona con los ataques de panico. El ataque de panico se describe como la aparicion subita de miedo y/o malestar intensos que alcanza su maxima expresion en minutos y han de presentarse al menos cuatro de los trece sintomas fisiologicos y cognitivos descritos (APA, 2013).\nEn terminos generales se estima la prevalencia anual en Estados Unidos y varios paises europeos en torno al 2-3% en los adultos y adolescentes (APA, 2013). \nEl trastorno de panico conlleva un alto grado de deterioro de la calidad de vida e insatisfaccion (Comer et al., 2011; Barrera y Norton, 2009), mayor probabilidad de intentos de suicidio y suicidio consumado (Nepon et al., 2010), aumento de disfuncion cognitiva y emocional (Deckersbach et al., 2011), asi como con costes economicos y sociales sustanciales (Batelaan et al., 2007; de Graaf, Tuithof y van Dorsselaer 2012).\nLa terapia cognitivo-conductual ha sido ampliamente estudiada y es un tratamiento psicologico eficaz para el trastorno de panico (Hoffart et al., 2016; Kaczkurkin y Foa, 2015; Porter y Chambless, 2015; Sanchez-Meca et al., 2010; Arch y Craske, 2009; Hoffmann y Smits, 2008). La duracion promedio del tratamiento es de 12 a 15 sesiones, pero incluso los tratamientos mas breves han demostrado ser eficaces siempre que estos tratamientos mantengan los elementos centrales de la intervencion estandar (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Las dos formas principales de terapia cognitivo conductual desarrolladas para el trastorno de panico han sido el tratamiento de control de panico del grupo de Barlow (Barlow y Cerny, 1998; Barlow y Craske, 2000) y la terapia cognitiva del grupo de Clark (Clark y Salkovskis, 1989). Ambos tratamientos incluyen los componentes de psicoeducacion acerca del panico, reestructuracion cognitiva, la exposicion a las sensaciones corporales interoceptivas temidas y exposicion en vivo a situaciones temidas, pero dando mayor peso a la exposicion el grupo de Barlow y al componente cognitivo el grupo de Clark.\nAunque el tratamiento para el trastorno de panico ha demostrado un exito significativo, hay mucho margen de mejora, las tasas de respuesta inadecuada al tratamiento (Smits et al., 2012; Frentz et al., 2014; Gloster et al., 2015; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004) y la necesidad de tratamiento adicional permanecen altas (Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, Eifert, y Craske, 2012; Casey et al., 2004; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014; Landon y Barlow, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014). Por lo tanto, sigue habiendo una clara necesidad de nuevas estrategias terapeuticas, combinaciones de las ya existentes o bien, personalizar el tratamiento segun las caracteristicas del paciente, para aumentar las tasas de respuesta al tratamiento, especialmente entre pacientes refractarios.\nSi bien hay muchos tratamientos cognitivo-conductuales bien establecidos para los trastornos de ansiedad y el panico, la investigacion centrada en la mejora de los factores de riesgo permanece aun en una etapa incipiente (Feldner, Zvolensky y Schmidt, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2007; Schmidt y Keough, 2010). En los ultimos anos se ha ido abriendo paso el interes por el estudio de los factores de riesgo para el panico asi como el desarrollo de intervenciones eficaces para el tratamiento de los mismos (Zvolensky, Schmidt, Bernstein y Keough, 2006). En el caso del trastorno de panico, se sabe que un factor de riesgo cognitivo es la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y que es una variable de diferencias individuales bien establecida que refleja una tendencia estable a temer las sensaciones corporales asociadas con la excitacion ansiosa (Reiss y McNally, 1985). \nPor otro lado, pese a contar con un gran numero de estudios donde se demuestra la eficacia de las terapias cognitivo-conductuales para el panico, estos se basan en paquetes terapeuticos que constan habitualmente de unas 12-15 sesiones (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Recientemente han adquirido especial enfasis los estudios de programas de tratamiento mas breves y facilmente aplicables en los servicios de Salud Mental a los que puedan acceder un mayor numero de pacientes (Deacon y Abramowitz, 2006; McHugth, Smits y Otto, 2009; Keough y Schmidt, 2014).\nHasta la fecha, la mayor intervencion centrada en la reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad se ha llevado a cabo por Schmidt et al. (2007) y Schmidt y Keough (2010). Ha sido realizada sobre individuos no clinicos con alto indice de sensibilidad a la ansiedad mediante los programas ASAT (Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Training) y el protocolo revisado ASERT (Anxiety Sensitivity Education and Reduction Training), consiguiendose una reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad cercana del 60% en un mes de seguimiento comparado con un grupo control (Keough y Schmidt, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014). \nEn nuestro pais no contamos con estudios donde se evalue la eficacia de tratamientos breves que tengan como diana terapeutica la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad aplicados en el entorno de un Centro de Salud Mental, sobre muestras clinicas.\nEl presente estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar la eficacia en la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad de un tratamiento breve (una sesion) con dos componentes (psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva) en pacientes con trastorno de panico con o sin agorafobia. Para ello se realizo un diseno cuasi-experimental de dos grupos de pacientes adultos (edad 18-65 anos) del Centro de Salud Mental de Pontones (Madrid) con trastorno de panico. El grupo experimental lo formaron 37 pacientes y el grupo control 39, con medidas pre, postratamiento y de seguimiento al mes y a los tres meses tras el tratamiento, a los cuales, al grupo experimental se le aplico un tratamiento basado en psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva y al grupo control, un tratamiento-placebo basado en psicoeducacion general para la salud. A los pacientes se les administro en cada momento de la evaluacion el Indice de Sensibilidad a la Ansiedad que evalua el miedo a los sintomas fisiologicos, cognitivos y sociales de la ansiedad; la subescala Rasgo del Inventario de Ansiedad Estado-Rasgo que evalua un factor que comprenderia las diferencias individuales, relativamente estables, para responder ante situaciones percibidas como amenazantes con un aumento en la ansiedad (ansiedad rasgo) y la Escala de Inadaptacion que evalua en que medida el trastorno de panico afecta a diferentes areas de la vida cotidiana del sujeto como trabajo, vida social, tiempo libre, relacion de pareja y convivencia familiar, junto con una valoracion global\nLos resultados indicaron que el tratamiento basado el psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva disminuyo significativamente los niveles de sensibilidad a la ansiedad asi como la interferencia que el trastorno de panico producia en la vida de los sujetos, efectos, ambos, que el tratamiento-placebo no logro. Se observo tambien que el tratamiento experimental, asi como el control-placebo, no lograron cambios significativos en la variable ansiedad-rasgo. Los cambios observados aumentaron en el seguimiento.\nSe puede concluir que el tratamiento compuesto por psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva se muestra eficaz para disminuir la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y el grado de interferencia que el trastorno de panico produce en la vida de los pacientes y que el tamano del efecto del tratamiento es grande y se incrementa con el paso del tiempo. La sensibilidad a la ansiedad como diatesis cognitiva para el trastorno de panico se ha mostrado como una diana terapeutica maleable en los pacientes con trastorno de panico. Sin embargo, el tratamiento experimental no se ha mostrado eficaz para disminuir la variable ansiedad-rasgo.",

      "title": "Aging, Disability and Frailty",
      "abstract": "Despite multiple and often overlapping definitions of disability and frailty, both are common clinical characteristics of aged individuals though not identical. The geriatric syndrome of frailty is described as status of global impairment of physiological reserves involving multiple organ systems. The clinical correlate of frailty manifests as increased vulnerability, impaired capability to withstand intrinsic and environmental stressors, and limited capacity to maintain physiological and psychosocial homeostasis. Geriatric frailty is found in 20–30% of the elderly population over 75 years and increases with advancing age. It was reported to be associated with long-term adverse health-related outcomes – increased risk of geriatric syndromes, dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional placement, and mortality. The clinical phenotype of frailty manifests as multi-system pathologies characterized by low physical activity, global weakness with low muscle strength, fatigability/exhaustion, overall slowness particularly of gait, loss of weight among others. These above-mentioned clinical symptoms could be explained by (or related to) some ‘preclinical’ diagnoses such as sarcopenia, osteopenia, nonspecific balance disorders, nutritional problems, and overall deconditioning. More recent studies found the frailty clinical phenotype to be associated with pathologic laboratory markers (IL-6, CRP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, IGF-1, D-dimers), which suggest possible pathogenesis involving hormonal dysregulation, immuno-aging, pro-coagulation and pro-inflammatory status. In the article, current recommendations for future research strategies of frailty syndrome will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies indicate that the increasing worldwide prevalence of chronic pain may be as high as 20-50 %. Furthermore, chronic pain is strongly associated with psychiatric comorbidities, and in particular, anxiety, depression and insomnia. Accordingly, pain is associated with decrements of many aspects of patient's lives including physical and emotional functioning, affective symptoms and sleep problems. The negative impact is higher in patients with greater pain severity. However, there is a bidirectional relationship between chronic pain and these symptoms. Patients with somatisation, health-seeking behaviours and poor sleep are at high risk of developing chronic widespread pain. The risk increases in tandem with severity of anxiety, depression or sleep problems, and those with multiple predisposing factors are at the highest risk (Figure 1)\nTherefore, clinically, it may be prudent to consider pain, sleep problems and anxiety/depression as co-existent components of a triad, where the presence of symptoms of one component should prompt investigation for the others.",

A wide range of psychiatric conditions are often comorbid with chronic pain and chronic pain conditions, negatively impacting successful treatment of either condition.

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

Anxiety is the complex blend of unpleasant emotions and cognitions that is both more oriented to the future and much more diffuse than fear (2).Anxiety has not only cognitive components but also physiological and behavioural components. At the cognitive level anxiety involves negative mood worry about the possible future, threat or danger, self-preoccupation and future threat and to control it if it occurs. At the physiological level anxiety often creates a state of tension and chronic over arousal which may affect readiness for delaying with danger. At behavioural level anxiety may create a strong tendency to avoid situations where danger might encounter but there is not the immediate urge to flee with anxiety as there is with fear (3). An increased risk of muscular skeletal disorder was found in workers with pre-existing anxiety and depression compared to the without them (4).",

Furthermore, several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that untreated insomnia predicts the onset of mental health disorders. Other sleep disorders also often cause mood and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, overlapping symptoms of sleep apnea, a sleep disorder with undoubted public health significance, and depression merits special attention. Sleep disorders have profound effect on daytime functioning causing daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. These symptoms may severely affect both the quality of life of the patient and also the sleep and quality of life of their bedpartners and family members, as well. It is increasingly appreciated that the majority of medically ill patients suffer from sleep disorders and sleep complaints, which contribute to their impaired quality of life and clinical outcomes. “Sleep Health” is an important aspect of everyone's life but has a special relevance in mentally or medically ill patients. In our studies focusing on patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (moderate to severe chronic renal failure, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) we have found high prevalence of sleep disorders (insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep, Sleep apnea). We have shown that they are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, increased illness intrusiveness and worse quality of life. Furthermore, RLS predicted mortality of kidney transplant recipients.

Adolescence is a developmental period when emotions can be extreme when elicited by both positive and negative experiences. The major internalizing disorders are depressive disorders and anxiety disorders; related ones in this domain include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and autism. Treatment effectiveness for teenagers with substance use disorder and a coexisting internalizing disorder is optimized when both domains are addressed. Behavioral-based treatment approaches with concurrent psychotropic medication are part of the treatment plan. One of the most common mental and behavioral disorders among adolescents in the United States is depression. For those suffering from a major depressive disorder, symptoms include a period of at least 2 weeks of a very persistent low mood accompanied with low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, and problems with sleep, energy, and concentration.",

It is unclear whether the frequency of these disorders increases or decreases with age. Clinical expression of psychiatric disorders in old age may be different from that seen in younger age groups, with less and often milder symptoms. Concurrently, comorbidity between different psychiatric disorders is immense, as well as comorbidity with somatic disorders. Cognitive function is often decreased in people with depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis, but whether these disorders are risk factors for dementia is unclear. Psychiatric disorders in the elderly are often related to cerebral neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease, although psychosocial risk factors are also important. Psychiatric disorders, common among the elderly, have consequences that include social deprivation, poor quality of life, cognitive decline, disability, increased risk for somatic disorders, suicide, and increased nonsuicidal mortality.",

      "title": "Neurobiological outcomes in the offspring of postnatally depressed mothers: Causes and consequences",
      "abstract": "Postnatal depression (PND) is the most common psychological disorder to affect women in the postpartum period, with an estimated prevalence of 13% in high-income countries (Gavin et al. 2005; O’Hara and Swain 1996). In low and middle income countries, the available evidence suggests that rates of PND may be substantially higher, with prevalence estimates ranging from 15 to 57% (Wachs et al. 2009). In terms of clinical presentation, depression occurring in the postnatal period appears to be indistinguishable from depression occurring at other times (Cooper et al., 2007), with persistent low mood and/or a profound loss of interest and enjoyment being defining characteristics. Other symptoms are mood-related disturbances in sleep, altered appetite, concentration impairment, retardation, agitation, feelings of guilt and hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts or impulses. The duration of episodes varies, but the majority of postpartum depressive episodes resolve spontaneously within 6 months to a year (Cooper and Murray 1995; Cox et al. 1993). Although PND may not be unique in terms of the symptom profile, the fact that this disorder occurs in the postpartum period is a particular concern. Specifically, PND affects the mother–infant dyad at a time when the infant is particularly reliant on his or her caregiver to meet their physical, social, and cognitive needs. The postpartum period is also a time when the family unit as a whole is likely to experience additional stress, and is therefore particularly vulnerable. Given these considerations, and the relatively high prevalence of PND, the potential for adverse impact is significant. One area of research focus, reviewed here, has examined the possibility the disturbances in the mother–child relationship occurring in the context of maternal PND result in fundamental alterations in key psychobiological systems in the infant, with persistent consequences. Notably, as PND typically resolves within the first year postpartum, and therefore is particularly relevant to early development, observations deriving from the study of PND in this area offer potentially broad insights into the relevance of early environmental factors to child neurobiological functioning. Given that depressive disorder is characterized by profound impairments in mood, energy levels, motivation, and feelings of self-worth, and has established detrimental effects on interpersonal functioning, it is perhaps unsurprising that mothers with PND have been found to show disturbances in the quality of care that they provide for their infant (for a review, see Murray et al. 2010a).",

The condition may seem to be part of the individual's character. There may be a convincing alternative explanation. The illness may cause the individual to be unappealing, leading the clinician to withdraw. The physical disorder may render the patient unable to communicate effectively. The patient may exhibit few, if any, physical signs or symptoms, especially at the outset. The disorder may be disguised by an atypical presentation. The only clue may be the absence of something that should be there.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find published studies in peer review journals written in English and Chinese from 1990-2010. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Additional hand search in music journals will also be conducted. The databases to be searched include:PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, PsychArticles, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Music Index (via EBSCOhost) as well as Chinese publication databases. The Chinese databases will include: (1) http://www.ceps.com.tw (2) http://www.cetd.com.tw (3) http://www.ncl.edu.tw/journal/journal_docu01.htm Initial keywords to be used will be‘preferred music’, ‘individualized music’, ‘familiar music’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘agitated behaviours’, ‘agress*’, ‘agitat*’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depress*’, ‘dementia’, ‘Alzheimer's disease’, ‘preferred music and dementia’, ‘preferred music and Alzheimer's disease’, ‘familiar music and dementia’ and ‘familiar music and Alzheimer's disease’. Assessment of methodological quality Quantitative papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative results will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). All results will be subject to double data entry. Odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. None",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

In this case report Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) of a GAD patient comorbid with health anxiety was introduced and the place of CBT in these conditions was discussed.\r\nCase: Twenty four year-old, single male patient was referred for worries abouth health and other life conditions. Seven years ago he started to find out several physical symptoms (abdominal paint, nausea) in his body; because of these symptoms he thought he will become ill, undergo surgical operation and die. He frequently consulted the doctors, releived as they didn’t find any illness, but his fears reoccured whenever he complained any symptom. Besides health anxiety, he feared to encounter bad occurrences. Paroxetine 20 mg/day prescribed and besides drug treatment CBT was started. CBT process begun with evaluation and case formulation, the aims of therapy were established and psycoeducation for CBT and anxiety was given. Repeated doctor consultations were prevented by exposure-response prevention (ERP). Cognitive restructering technics were used for health and other worries. \r\nConclusion: CBT alone or in addition to pharmacotherapy may be an effective treatment option for GAD with health anxiety.",

      "title": "Practical Recommendations for Hypnotic Switching in Insomnia Management: A Canadian Expert Clinical Framework",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a complex condition in which patients experience difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening. Chronic insomnia is defined as dissatisfying sleep quality or quantity, occurring at least three times per week, that has persisted for at least three months. Insomnia is common, with a higher incidence in certain subpopulations, including older adults (≥65 years of age) and patients with psychiatric and physical comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and alcohol or substance use disorders. Individuals experiencing insomnia often have disrupted sleep architecture, with polysomnography showing reduced time spent in the rejuvenating slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. As such, insomnia can seriously impair daytime functioning, cognition, and quality of life. Further, insomnia may result in a higher risk of various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, though the association between insomnia and these comorbidities is likely bi-directional. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the diagnosis is often missed or trivialized in medical practice. Given the profound impact of chronic insomnia, a proactive diagnosis and successful treatment is essential. The primary non-pharmacologic treatment option available for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on sleep hygiene techniques, sleep restriction, circadian rhythm therapy, and cognitive therapy. Although CBT-I is the first-line treatment for insomnia and should always be recommended, it may not always be available in a timely manner, it can be costly and not every patient can afford it, some patients choose to opt out, and may not be sufficient as a single therapy approach. Thus, in many cases, pharmacotherapy may be needed in addition to or instead of CBT-I to treat insomnia and improve daytime functioning and associated cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Of note, patients also often self-medicate with over-the-counter medications, including cannabis products. Currently, commonly prescribed medications for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs; e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam) and Z-drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone).10 In addition, despite their risks, antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have also been used to treat insomnia despite being off-label and promoting sleep indirectly.",

Worldwide, depression is a major cause of disability and premature death. When the negative reactions to life`s situations become repetitively intense and frequent we develop symptoms of depression. Life throws up innumerable situations, which we greet with both negative and positive emotions such as excitement, frustration, fear, happiness, anger, sadness. Depression is prevalent among all age groups, in almost all walks of life. Indians are among the world's most depressed. According to a World Health Organization-sponsored study, while around 9% of people in India reported having an extended period of depression within their lifetime, nearly 36% suffered from what is called Major Depressive Episode (MDE).MDE is characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy and poor concentration, besides feeling depressed. Lowest prevalence of MDE was in China (12%). The average age of depression in India is 31.9 years compared to 18.8 years in China, and 22.7 years in the US. The female: male ratio was about 2:1.WHO ranks depression as the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide and projects that by 2020, it will be the second leading cause.

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are an important aspect of geriatric psychiatry. In the United States, more than half of noninstitutionalized individuals age 65 years and older report chronic sleep difficulties (Foley et al. 1995; \"National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement\" 1991; Prinz et al. 1990). These problems affect quality of life, increase the risk of accidents and falls, and may lead to long-term-care placement (Pollak and Perlick 1991; Pollak et al. 1990; Sanford 1975). Working effectively with elderly individuals requires expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) includes eight general sleep disorders categories: insomnia disorder, hypersomolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, restless legs syndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Patients with these conditions generally complain about some aspect of their sleep and/or waking function. For some patients, the sleep-focused concerns pertain to the quality, timing, amounts, or discontinuity in their sleep. For other patients, primary complaints may focus more on daytime sleepiness or impairment. For a subset of patients, complaints may focus on unusual behaviors occurring in sleep. In this chapter we consider those sleep-wake disorders most commonly encountered in geriatric psychiatry. Among these are those insomnia disorders involving a difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime impairment or distress, as well as those that present as disorders of excessive daytime somnolence characterized by persistent daytime sleepiness that causes significant distress or impairment in function (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The most important disorders of excessive sleepiness are sleep ap-nea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and narcolepsy. Circadian rhythm disorders manifest as a misalignment between an indi-vidual's sleep-wake cycle and the pattern that is desired or required (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The circadian rhythm is important for function because it is a cycle not only of sleep and wakefulness but also of many physiological processes and phe-nomena, including body temperature, alertness, cognitive performance, and hormone release (Czeisler et al. 1990; Folkard and Totterdell 1994; Minors et al. 1994).",

      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

      "abstract": "SummaryProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychiatric symptoms, then a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) should be considered.CFS probably is an heterogeneous disease, maybe multifactorial, or it includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. In some cases, the mode of presentation of the illness implicate the exposure to chemical and/or food toxins as precipitating factors (e.g., ciguatera poisoning, Gulf War Syndrome, etc.). In other CFS cases, the etiology is still unknown: there are various hypotheses on pathogenetic events which, alone or in association with each other, may precipitate the illness. In fact, it is probable an involvement of multiple events in CFS onset where different precipitating factors can interact each other, even if not always all present in the single patient: latent and/or chronic viral infections, immunologic and neuroendocrine dysfunctions, psychological, environmental and mood factors.In accordance to this theory, we consider various subgroups of CFS patients on the basis of the pathway and the mode of presentation of the disease. The Clinic of Infectious Diseases of \"G. D'Annunzio\" University of Chieti is one of the main National Reference Centers for the CFS Study in Italy. From January 1992 to January 1998, 238 patients came to our observation: 89 of them met CDC criteria for CFS (1994), 127 did not; the other 22 patients are still under evaluation. Our patients underwent physical examination (including tests for searching for the possible coexistence of a fibromyalgia syndrome), psychiatric interview with several neuropsychological tests, laboratory tests (including magnesium determination on serum), neuroendocrine evaluation (circadian rhythm of several hormones, buspirone challenge test), SPECT scans to evaluate cerebral perfusion, and other examinations where necessary in according to the symptomatology of each patient (e.g., orthopedic, ORL, EMG, muscle biopsy, etc.).According to our preliminary results, we subdivided our patients in different subgroups and we studied them comparatively.We report the more significant data collected from this evaluation that might lead to a better understanding of the syndrome and in particular of its pathways course, a knowledge that will help in choosing appropriate therapies for each subgroups.",

Although many of these patients will be satis ed with negative medical examination results, a signi cant subgroup will anxiously continue to worry about the possibility of su ering from a yet undiagnosed physical disease-a phenomenon known as somatization. Somatization denotes the presence of physical symptoms (e.g., chest pain) for which no demonstrable disease process or bodily oriented pathology can be identi ed as the cause. ese individuals are likely to continue to seek help for their physical symptoms, demand more physical examinations and specialist referrals, undergo costly laboratory tests, and in rare cases, even end up on an operating table (Harth & Hermes, 2007; Warwick & Salkovskis, 1990). At the extreme, such somatization behavior can interfere with life activities and goals, resulting in clinically signi cant impairment-a phenomenon typically classi ed as somatization disorder. Yet, somatization processes frequently occur in other \"somatic disorders,\" including hypochondriasis, pain disorder, conversion disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder, as well as many other psychiatric conditions (e.g., panic disorder, major depressive disorder).",

In 17 cases the family or friends were worried about the patient's health. In eight, nervous or mental symptoms were rather marked. In 43 no abnormality of behavior was noted. There seemed to be no psychiatric symptom-complex common to lipodystrophy, aside from self-consciousness and the tendency to share in the alarm of friends and relatives. Psychiatric symptoms when present seemed on the whole to be psychoneurotic. No constant neurologic symptoms or signs were observed accompanying lipodystrophy. Although weakness is a usual symptom at one stage or another of lipodystrophy, no general symptom-complex or diseases can be considered closely related to it until more cases are available for study. Nervous symptoms in all cases resulting from self-consciousness over personal appearance are not constantly present. No conclusive evidence has been collected to support the theory that the integrity of the nervous system is affected by the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), results from a force to the head and can cause acute physical, cognitive, and psychological symptoms. The majority of concussion symptoms will resolve within a month, but upward of a third of patients will have persistent, chronic symptoms. When these symptoms become chronic and persist beyond 1–3 months, this is termed post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Psychological changes associated with PCS may in part be due to a traumatic event and the injury itself and therefore post-traumatic stress reactions may contribute. In addition, alterations to daily life and alteration of lifestyle as a result of the injury can cause feelings of disconnection which in turn can feed anxiety and depression symptoms. A preinjury diagnosis or history of psychiatric or mood disorder, migraine, or family history of psychiatric illness is one the greatest risk factors for the development of PCS. It is recommended that evaluation of concussion and those with PCS take a multidisciplinary approach including evaluation by psychology, psychiatry, and/or neuropsychology. While most concussions do not require treatment, those with PCS will not likely see the resolution of their physical and psychological symptoms without intervention. Treatment is limited, but cognitive behavioral treatment has shown promise in the management of PCS symptoms. It is important to recognize the role psychology plays in the development and persistence of PCS and to recognize and seek collaborative care when treating these patients.",

      "title": "Biological mechanisms underlying the role of physical fitness in health and resilience",
      "abstract": "Physical fitness, achieved through regular exercise and/or spontaneous physical activity, confers resilience by inducing positive psychological and physiological benefits, blunting stress reactivity, protecting against potentially adverse behavioural and metabolic consequences of stressful events and preventing many chronic diseases. In this review, we discuss the biological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of physical fitness on mental and physical health. Physical fitness appears to buffer against stress-related disease owing to its blunting/optimizing effects on hormonal stress responsive systems, such as the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. This blunting appears to contribute to reduced emotional, physiological and metabolic reactivity as well as increased positive mood and well-being. Another mechanism whereby regular exercise and/or physical fitness may confer resilience is through minimizing excessive inflammation. Chronic psychological stress, physical inactivity and abdominal adiposity have been associated with persistent, systemic, low-grade inflammation and exert adverse effects on mental and physical health. The anti-inflammatory effects of regular exercise/activity can promote behavioural and metabolic resilience, and protect against various chronic diseases associated with systemic inflammation. Moreover, exercise may benefit the brain by enhancing growth factor expression and neural plasticity, thereby contributing to improved mood and cognition. In summary, the mechanisms whereby physical fitness promotes increased resilience and well-being and positive psychological and physical health are diverse and complex.",

Vecina istraživaca danas definira depresivnost u terminima kontinuuma od normalne, povremene i prolazne žalosti do duboke depresije koja traje ili se stalno ponovo vraca. Danas se procjenjuje da oko 10-15% djece u opcoj populaciji ima znacajno izražene simptome depresije. Psihosomatski simptomi predstavljaju sve one tjelesne simptome koji se javljaju pod utjecajem emocionalnih cimbenika, a ukljucuju jedan organski sustav, obicno pod kontrolom autonomnog živcanog sustava. Simptomi se mogu javiti u rasponu od jednog ili vise simptoma slabijeg intenziteta pa sve do veceg broja vrlo intenzivnih simptoma koji djetetu ometaju svakodnevno funkcioniranje. Razliciti tjelesni simptomi psihogene etiologije koji se javljaju u djetinjstvu i adolescenciji dio su razlicitih klinickih slika (pa tako i depresije), a najcesce se opisuju u kategoriji razlicitih psihosomatskih i somatoformnih poremecaja (APA, 1996). U radu su prikazani rezultati istraživanja koje je provedeno s ciljem utvrđivanja specificnih aspekata depresivnosti koji su povezani s pojavom psihosomatskih simptoma u djece i adolescenata. Istraživanje je provedeno na uzorku od 315 ucenika (158 djevojcica i 157 djecaka) od 5. do 8. razreda osnovne skole. U istraživanju su primijenjene dvije skale: Skala depresivnosti za djecu i adolescente SDD (Vulic-Prtoric, 2003) i Upitnik psihosomatskih simptoma za djecu i adolescente PSS (Vulic-Prtoric, 2005). Rezultati provedenog istraživanja pokazuju da ispitanici koji postižu klinicki znacajno izražene simptome depresivnosti imaju i veci broj psihosomatskih simptoma (osobito pseudoneuroloskih, gastrointestinalnih, kardiovaskularnih) te da u vecoj mjeri doživljavaju glavobolje, umor i razlicite oblike bolova. Nadalje, utvrđene su spolne razlike kako u doživljavanju simptoma depresivnosti tako i psihosomatskih simptoma: u usporedbi s djecacima, djevojcice imaju znacajno veci broj simptoma. Zakljucak: Dobiveni rezultati potvrđuju teorijske postavke u razvojnoj psihopatologiji o dvosmjernoj povezanosti depresivnih i psihosomatskih simptoma: depresivnosti kao snažnom rizicnom cimbeniku u razvoju psihosomatskih reakcija, ali i kao posljedici dugotrajnijeg doživljavanja tjelesnih tegoba. Razmotrene su i prakticne implikacije dobivenih rezultata, posebice u planiranju tretmana djece sklone somatizaciji, te depresivne djece i adolescenata.",

      "abstract": "A depressão, um transtorno do humor, resulta em alterações psiquiátricas que impactam negativamente na capacidade funcional e no bem-estar do indivíduo, caracterizando um amplo espectro de sintomas depressivos. O Transtorno Depressivo Maior (TDM) é marcado por prejuízos emocionais, anedonia, fadiga, distúrbios do sono, ideação suicida, alterações cognitivas e motoras, além de sintomas somáticos como alterações de apetite. Para diagnosticar o TDM, é necessário a presença de pelo menos 5 desses critérios por 14 dias consecutivos. A classificação da gravidade do TDM pode ser leve, moderada ou grave, dependendo do impacto funcional e na qualidade de vida do paciente. A prevalência global é de 12%, com maior incidência em mulheres e um pico de incidência aos 40 anos, embora haja um aumento em jovens, frequentemente associado ao abuso de substâncias. O TDM está correlacionado com disfunções familiares e é um fator de risco significativo para suicídio. O diagnóstico do TDM é eminentemente clínico, com base em uma avaliação detalhada da história médica, familiar e social do paciente, complementada por exames laboratoriais para descartar outras condições médicas e psiquiátricas. O tratamento inclui abordagens farmacológicas e não farmacológicas, como a psicoterapia, especialmente a Terapia Cognitivo-Comportamental (TCC), que visa modificar padrões de pensamento negativos. A mudança de estilo de vida, com foco na regularização do sono, alimentação saudável e exercícios físicos, também é recomendada para melhorar os sintomas depressivos. Na terapia farmacológica, os Inibidores Seletivos da Recaptação de Serotonina (ISRS) e Inibidores da Recaptação de Serotonina e Noradrenalina (IRSN) são frequentemente prescritos como tratamento de primeira linha, embora possam causar efeitos colaterais como cefaleia, insônia e redução da libido. Os antidepressivos atípicos, como bupropiona e mirtazapina, são alternativas em pacientes que não respondem aos ISRS ou IRSN ou experimentam efeitos colaterais significativos. Outras inovadoras opções também estão sendo descritas como capazes de melhoras o quadro depressivo. O tratamento do TDM é, portanto, multifacetado e deve ser adaptado às necessidades individuais de cada paciente, visando à remissão dos sintomas e ao restabelecimento do funcionamento psicossocial adequado.",

Bovendien is neuroticisme niet alleen geassocieerd met problemen op het gebied van persoonlijk welbevinden maar ook met substantiele kosten voor de maatschappij. Het is daarom belangrijk om zowel de oorzaken als de gevolgen van neuroticisme beter te begrijpen. Gedrags-genetische studies suggereren dat ongeveer de helft van de verschillen tussen mensen in neuroticisme veroorzaakt wordt door omgevingsinvloeden. In dit proefschrift heb ik onderzocht welke levensgebeurtenissen voorafgaan aan veranderingen in neuroticisme, en hoe lang zulke veranderingen aanhouden. Hiertoe heb ik een aantal longitudinale studies uitgevoerd en de literatuur betreffende veranderingen in neuroticisme in volwassenen samengevat. De resultaten laten zien dat stressvolle levensgebeurtenissen (in het bijzonder sociale stress en conflict), die gekarakteriseerd kunnen worden als onvoorspelbaar, oncontroleerbaar, onverwacht, onwenselijk, of niet passend bij de normale levensloop, vaak worden gevolgd door een langdurige toename in neuroticisme. Echter, positieve levensveranderingen kunnen ook leiden tot een afname van neuroticisme. Daarnaast heb ik de betekenis onderzocht van de relatie tussen neuroticisme en veelvoorkomende psychische problemen, zoals angst, depressie, en middelenmisbruik. De resultaten laten zien dat neuroticisme een belangrijke voorspeller is voor de ontwikkeling van veelvoorkomende psychische problemen, en tot op zekere hoogte gezien kan worden als een maat voor meer milde problemen. De conclusie van dit proefschrift is dat het neuroticisme niveau van mensen mede afhankelijk is van zijn of haar omgeving, gevoelig is voor positieve en negatieve levensgebeurtenissen, consequenties heeft voor psychische gezondheid, en veranderlijker is dan lang werd gedacht.",

Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

Over 100,000 American veterans of Desert Storm/Shield (approximately 15% of deployed U. S. Armed Forces) returned from the Persian Gulf and slowly (6-24 months or more) presented with a variety of complex signs and symptoms characterized by disabling fatigue, intermittent fevers, night sweats, arthralgia, myalgia, impairments in short-term memory, headaches, skin rashes, intermittent diarrhea, abdominal bloating, chronic bronchitis, photophobia, confusion, transient visual scotomata, irritability and depression and other signs and symptoms that until recently have defied appropriate diagnoses (1-3). These symptoms are not localized to any one organ, and the signs and symptoms and routine laboratory test results are not consistent with a single, specific disease (1). The signs and symptoms of GWI have been reported by 27/28 of the Coalition Armed Forces that were deployed against Iraqi units in Kuwait and Southern Iraq. The only exception is France. This brief review will summarize some of the possible exposures that occurred, the types of illnesses that resulted from these exposures, and some of the treatments that have been used on GWI patients.

Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Personality represents a combination of stable, habitual patterns of behavior that are characteristic of a person and that develop over the first two decades of life and then change little. Personality patterns are termed traits because they are longstanding and consistent, just like other traits such as eye color, hair texture, and height. State behavior refers to behaviors that come and go, such as a mood state and many DSM axis I conditions. Abnormal behavioral states are assumed to represent illness and underlying brain dysfunction or disease. Abnormal behavioral traits are assumed not to reflect brain dysfunction or disease, but rather a deviance that has developed during a person’s formative years.",

Besonders häufig treten Angsterkrankungen, Suchterkrankungen, Persönlichkeitsstörungen und Aufmerksamkeitsdefizithyperaktivitätssyndrome zusätzlich auf. Komorbide Störungen komplizieren den Verlauf der bipolaren Störung: Im Schnitt haben Patienten mit bipolar affektiver Störung plus Komorbidität eine schlechteres Funktionsniveau, sie haben ein früheres Ersterkrankungsalter und sprechen schlechter auf die Therapie an. Es gibt wenig gesicherte Erkenntnis zur Therapie “komorbider” Störungen plus bipolar affektiver Störungen.

      "abstract": "Abstract The more important part of the assessment of any patient with dizziness or unsteadiness is the clinical history. Symptoms of vertigo, dizziness or unsteadiness can be present in diseases from many organs and systems so the doctor should not automatically equate dizziness with the inner ear. “True” or rotational vertigo implies involvement of the semicircular canals or their central connections, usually the brainstem or cerebellum. However, patients with fainting or syncope syndromes can describe transient rotational feelings as well. It is often the accompanying symptoms and presentation pattern that leads to a diagnosis. Some of the questions doctors should try to answer are: Is this a single, prolonged attack of vertigo, as in vestibular neuritis or brainstem stroke? Is this a recurrent vertiginous syndrome, as in vestibular migraine or Meniere’s disease? Are there any associated migraneous features like in the former or aural symptoms like in the latter? Are the symptoms provoked by lying down/turning over in bed, as in BPPV, or only occur whilst standing up as in postural hypotension? Are there any associated brainstem symptoms as in TIAs or demyelination? Is the patient chronic “dizziness” a progressive gait disorder? Carefully enquiring about the nature of the symptom (vertigo, dizziness, fainting sensation, unsteadiness), presentation (acute, recurrent, chronic, progressive), duration and triggers is vital in reaching a diagnosis.",

La hipertension arterial es asintomatica, razon por la cual el paciente desconoce la severidad de la misma, constituyendose en un factor de riesgo para la salud. Esta enfermedad cardiovascular esta asociada a diversos factores psicologicos, como el estres, la ansiedad, depresion, hostilidad, ira y bajos niveles de apoyo social. Para el tratamiento de esta patologia, se requiere un proceso de implicacion activa por parte del paciente denominado adherencia terapeutica, que le permite al diagnosticado seguir las recomendaciones y adquirir habitos beneficiosos; la falta de adherencia es una de las principales causas del bajo control de la presion arterial. Existen factores que interfieren en este proceso como son: a. los derivados del paciente (psicologicos): ansiedad, estres, trastornos del estado de animo y rasgos de personalidad tipo a, b. los del entorno socio-economico y cultural (apoyo inadecuado), c. los de la enfermedad (asintomatologia y cronicidad) y d. los del tratamiento farmacologico, servicios de salud y personal que atiende al paciente.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEl presente articulo tiene como objetivo, establecer la relacion entre los factores psicosociales y las estrategias de afrontamiento empleadas por los pacientes con enfermedad oncologica.

The second aspect of psychosomatic medicine suggests that specific somatic diseases are influenced by mental states. Thus, peptic ulcer is aggravated when the patient is distressed or under tension and apt to be improved during periods of physical and emotional relaxation. The third consideration is the one that is least established, but nevertheless the most discussed recently.

      "abstract": "정신분열증은 일반적으로 사람들이 미쳤다고 말하는 심각한 정신장애로서 사고와 지각, 행동에 있어서의 붕괴와 황폐화를 가져오는 것이다. 그 증상은 일관성이 결여된 사고, 빈곤한 말, 통찰력의 결여, 망상, 환각, 단조롭거나 부적절한 정서상태 등을 포함한다. 이러한 정신분열증 환자들은 일상적인 생활기능이 손상되어 정상적인 사회관계를 수행하지 못한다. 대부분 친구가 없고, 가족으로부터 고립되어 있는 경우가 많으며, 학교 혹은 직장 생활에 적응하지 못한다.\r\n정신분열증은 단일한 원인과 단일한 경로를 가진 단일 질환(single disease entity)이라기 보다는, 여러 원인과 경로에 의해 발병되는 하나의 증후군(syndrome)으로 인식된다. 발병 원인에 대한 이제까지의 이해는, 어떤 개인이 스트레스 환경에 노출되었을 때 그가 가진 생물학적, 발달적, 혹은 심리학적 취약점으로 인해 발병한다고 보고 있다. 따라서 같은 병명으로 동일한 증상을 보인다 하더라고 그 병이 발병한 원인과 현재의 임상경과와 심리적 상태를 알기 어렵다면 효과적인 치료를 할 수 없\r\n을 것이다. 발병 원인에 대한 다각적인 탐색과 진단이 요청되는 것도 그와 같은 맥락에서이다. 그러나 정신분열증 환자들의 유전적 혹은 생화학적 요인에 대한 검사보다 심리적 상태와 심리적 병원에 대한 검사가 더욱 어려운데, 그 이유는 현대 정신의학에서 사용하는 심리학적 검사가 아느 정도의 의사소통 능력을 필요로 하기 때문이다. 투사적 성격 검사나 목록식 성격 검사, 지능검사, 임상 면접 등은 그 주요 수단이 언어이므로, 정상적인 자아기능이 손상된 정신분열증 환자의 경우, 그들의 언어와 행동이 그들의 병명을 진단케 할 수는 있어도 진단 받은 병의 심리적 원인까지 알려주기는 힘들다.",

      "abstract": "Résumé Parmi les facteurs de résistance thérapeutique d’un épisode dépressif majeur (EDM), on peut évoquer d’emblée l’association aux pathologies somatiques, au premier rang desquelles figurent les affections endocriniennes, cardiovasculaires et métaboliques. Plusieurs d’entre elles sont d’ailleurs susceptibles d’engendrer la survenue d’un EDM, en pérenniser les manifestations cliniques, et conduire à la résistance aux traitements classiquement proposés dans cette indication. La co-occurrence d’une pathologie somatique et d’un EDM n’est pas une situation rare en pratique clinique quotidienne dans la mesure où elle concerne 25 % de la population hospitalisée pour pathologie somatique [1]. Des études longitudinales montrent que les EDM contemporains d’une pathologie somatique sont plus à risque d’évoluer vers la chronicité ou la résistance aux stratégies thérapeutiques standards que les EDM sans comorbidité somatique [2]. Réciproquement, la dépression majeure est aujourd’hui reconnue pour accroître singulièrement le risque de développer un cancer, un trouble métabolique ou une pathologie cardiaque comme les cardiopathies ischémiques, avec un retentissement important sur l’évolution et le pronostic de la maladie somatique [3]. Cette comorbidité, à l’origine d’une résistance croisée entre les deux pathologies, est fréquemment méconnue en pratique clinique, souvent du fait d’une attention sélectivement portée sur la pathologie ayant motivé la prise en charge, mais aussi en raison des difficultés diagnostiques liées à la superposition des troubles. Sur le plan thérapeutique, les implications sont considérables. En effet, un traitement antidépresseur bien conduit montre souvent une efficacité, non seulement en réduisant l’intensité des symptômes dépressifs, mais également en améliorant le cours évolutif de la pathologie somatique, ainsi que son pronostic [4]. Une meilleure connaissance de ces intrications s’avère donc indispensable de façon à permettre le traitement de la pathologie associée, mais aussi limiter l’impact négatif de cette dernière sur le diagnostic et l’évolution de l’affection primitivement reconnue.",

      "abstract": "Depression is recognised as the most common mental health disorder in the elderly. It does not only increase the morbidity, but it increases the mortality as well. Depression is an illness characterised by the depressed mood, causing changes in the overall thinking, observation, physical condition, behaviour and social functioning. The common depression symptoms are sadness, hopelessness, anxiety, dejection, indisposition, nausea, passiveness, self-doubt, despondency, loss of interests and sources of pleasure, lack of energy and increased tiredness. Other possible symptoms include sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, concentration and attention difficulties, loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, gloomy and pessimistic view of the future, and self-harming and suicidal thoughts. Poor physical health has long been recognised as one of the most important risk factors of depression in elderly people. Also, retirement, loss of workforce, stress, loss of a loved one and the grieving process cause the development of depressive symptoms.However, depression in the elderly is largely associated with physical illnesses.Physical illness and depression can develop at the same time, but depression can also appear as a consequence of a physical ilness or as a side effect of medications.Depression treatment begins after well-conducted diagnostics, based particularly on the intensity of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and comorbidity.In the treatment of depression conditions, some basic guidelines must be followed, such as sufficient treatment with an appropriate dosage of medication, the choice of antidepressants in accordance with the safety profile and clinical picture, regular combination of psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and the conduction of quality evaluation.Suicide prevention is the main goal of treatment among the elderly.Despite the knowledge that antidepressants and psychological interventions are equally effective in older patients and young adults, depression in the elderly is insufficiently treated mainly because it is not adequately diagnosed.",

There are some women who enjoy the state of persistent arousal and who do not present for treatment, so the prevalence and cause of the condition are currently unknown.

      "abstract": "Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) will typically experience a range of motor and nonmotor symptoms during the course of their illness, each of which will affect a particular individual to varying degrees. However, patients' perceptions of troublesome symptoms often differ from the clinician's view, and these discrepancies can hamper effective management of PD. In this study, we have assessed 265 consecutive PD patients by asking them to rank their three most troublesome symptoms in the last 6 months, so to gain further insight from the impact of illness on patients' quality of life. Patients were divided into early (<6 years) and late PD groups (>/=6 years) from symptom onset. The division at 6 years was based on the mean time from symptom onset to the development of motor complications. In the early PD group, the 5 most prevalent complaints (ranked in descending order) are slowness, tremor, stiffness, pain, and loss of smell and/or taste. In the advanced PD group, fluctuating response to their medication (most common: wearing-off phenomenon followed by dyskinesia), mood changes, drooling, sleep problems (most common: middle and late night insomnia followed by daytime sleepiness), and tremor were the top 5. Our findings provide further evidence for the diversity of experience in PD and suggest that as the disease advances the most troublesome issues that patients perceive are the lack of response to medication and the nonmotor aspects of the disease, highlighting the importance of assessment and patient-centered management in the follow-up of these patients.",

      "title": "Het mechanisme hoe slaapdeprivatie obesitas induceerd",
      "abstract": "Slaapdeprivatie en obesitas zijn grote publieke gezondheidsproblemen met grote sociale-, persoonlijke- en gezondheidszorgkosten en problemen. Slaapdeprivatie is geassocieerd met obesitas in vele epidemiologische studies. De prevalentie van obesitas neemt toe en de gemiddelde slaapduur neemt af, maar waar deze correlatie vandaan komt en welk causaal mechanisme hiervoor verantwoordelijk is is nog niet vastgesteld. De vraag die in deze scriptie beantwoord zal worden is wat de invloed is van slaapdeprivatie op voedselinname en obesitas en welk causaal mechanisme hieraan ten grondslag ligt. \r\n\r\nSlaapdeprivatie is een toestand waarin men onvoldoende, 5 uur in 24 uur, slaap krijgt, dit leidt tot een homeostatisch stressvolle situatie waardoor het lichaam meer energie wil opslaan om hierop te kunnen anticiperen. In onze huidige maatschappij is er altijd meer dan voldoende voedsel aanwezig wat ertoe leidt dat een dergelijke situatie leidt tot gewichtstoename. De prefrontale cortex, thalamus, parietale kwab en het limbische systeem laten verhoogde activiteit zien bij slaapdeprivatie, wat ertoe kan leiden dat men humeuriger wordt, de cognitieve - en motorische prestaties achteruit gaan en de remming op gedragingen verminderd wordt. Slaapdeprivatie leidt tot verhoogd energieverbruik (90 kcal) door additionele waaktijd en verhoogde energie inname (300-550 kcal) door verhoogde inname van snacks laat op de avond, wat een positieve energiebalans als gevolg heeft. De voedingsmiddelen die geconsumeerd worden bevatten meer vet, koolhydraten en zijn energierijker en verhoogde inname hiervan zal uiteindelijk leiden tot gewichtstoename. Wanneer er onderzocht wordt wat de causaliteit is van deze observeringen wordt er geen netto effect gezien van de hormonen ghreline en leptine, en het effect van GLP-1 is sekse afhankelijk. Slaapdeprivatie induceert verhoogde activiteit in hersengebieden verantwoordelijk voor plezier, beloning, motivatie en salience. Met name de insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal prefrontale cortex en de OFC zijn geactiveerd, waarbij er verhoogde connectiviteit is gezien tussen de dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, de insula en het putamen. \r\n\r\nDoor slaapdeprivatie worden gebieden in de hersenen geactiveerd, dit wordt geinduceerd vanuit de hypothalamus naar hersengebieden verantwoordelijk voor genot, beloning en motivatie. Deze activatie leidt tot een grotere salience en verhoogde beloning van ongezonde voeding, waardoor men deze voedingsmiddelen meer gaat consumeren als reactie op slaapdeprivatie wat op den duur zal leiden tot gewichtstoename en obesitas.",

      "title": "Depressive Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is most often used to treat disorders of mood. The internally experienced feeling is the emotional state reflected in the way we present ourselves to others and in the ways we react to them. Mood varies with daily circumstances and is sensitive to the conditions of the body, particularly physical health, fatigue, hunger, and hormonal activity. Moods are experienced internally and fluctuate widely. Two disorders are recognized. Depression, or depressive mood disorder, is dominated by sadness, hopelessness, fear of the future, and the persistent thought that life is not worth living. Mania, or manic mood disorder, is a state of excitement, grandiosity, expansiveness, and feelings of increased power and energy. In the present psychiatric classification, mania is labeled bipolar disorder and the depressed phase is labeled major depression. In a depressive mood disorder, body functions are disrupted. Patients are sleepless, appetite is poor, and weight loss may be pronounced, at times amounting to 20% of the body weight within a few weeks. Work, sexual activity, and family may be disregarded. The future appears hopeless, patients believe they are helpless to affect it, and their thoughts are filled with gloom. Threats of suicide reflect their distress. They are often agitated and restless. Many meet the criteria for the malignant syndrome of melancholia. Overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, the depressed patient dwells on thoughts of suicide. He may believe that others are watching or talking about him; voices are heard when no one is present; and concerns that his spouse is unfaithful dominate his thought. At times, the events depicted on the television or movie screen seem to apply directly to him. Such strange thoughts are delusions, and this severe state of depressed mood and disorder in thought is labeled delusional depression or psychotic depression. These disorders require intensive treatment and almost always hospital care. A depressed patient is commonly unaware of the day’s events, registers little of what happens around her, and has a compromised memory. This form of depression can be difficult to distinguish from an Alzheimer-type dementia. When the symptoms of dementia are brought about by depression, however, they can be reversed with treatment.",

The stress-system model provides clinicians with a framework for thinking about the neurobiology of functional somatic symptoms and for explaining them to children and their families. The components of the brain-body stress system—the neurobiological systems that regulate body state—include the circadian clock, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system, immune-inflammatory system, and brain stress systems that underpin salience detection, arousal, pain, and emotional states. All components of the stress system are interconnected and form part of a larger, integrated system that ensures effective energy regulation, promotes health and survival, and protects the individual from a broad range of threats. When the stress system—or one or more components of the stress system—is activated too much, too little, too long, or in aberrant ways, or when it fails to return to baseline function, then functional somatic symptoms may arise.",

Now and then manifestations can be unpretentious or inferable from an assortment of other ailments or life changes. Additionally, more established grown-ups are more averse to tell a medical care supplier about the side effects identified with psychological health issues than for actual indications they are encountering. This can be because of the disgrace joined to emotional wellness issues, or on the grounds that the individual will be unable to clarify what the person in question is experiencing. As parental figures, the best thing we can is to comprehend the indications and dangers related with normal psychological well-being issues and be tireless in noticing and imparting changes or side effects to the fitting medical services experts.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The co-existence of depression and chronic disease is frequent. This association leads to a worse evolution, of both the psychiatric framework and the chronic disease. However, the depression diagnosis is not always evident and even when it is identified correctly it is often under-treated, either for reasons imputable to the doctor or due to the patient's poor adhesion to the therapeutics. Description of the case: Maria frequently attends medical appointments complaining of dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue and bone and joint pains. The identified health problems include entities with a potential aetiological role in these symptoms, which are overvalued by the patient. However, the latter complied only irregularly with the pharmaceutical therapeutics and kept lifestyle detrimental to the control of such health problems. After multiple appointments of similar pattern she admitted, upon questioning, irritability, anhedonia, tendency for social isolation, hypersomnia and depressive humour, which she attributed to her physical aflictions. After several attempts to introduce anti-depressive medication, which the patient waived a few days later, alleging side effects, medical appointments at fortnight intervals resulted in a better compliance with the therapeutics, both anti-depressive and other, less complaints and better control of her chronic diseases. Comment: The emphasis on the somatic symptoms and the fact that they could be explained within the context of the patient's co-morbidity, therefore withdrawn as criteria of depression suspicion, led to the masking of the latter over time. The doctor must always consider the frequency of depression associated with chronic diseases, in order to achieve better diagnosis acuity. The inclusive approach, accounting for symptoms that are irrespective of being explained by the coexisting pathology, lessens the risk of not diagnosing an oligosymptomatic depressive framework, notwithstanding the fact that it may generate false-positive features. On the contrary, the excluding approach used for some time retarded the (false-negative) diagnosis and the treatment, with repercussions on the control of the whole health problems and on the patient's quality of life.",

For eight per cent of women with severe symptoms, PMS is associated with reduced quality of life2. Although the cause is not conclusively known, present care of PMS is managed with medication, typically non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and other strategies1. The patient in this case received a holistic approach incorporating diet and lifestyle modifications. It involved treatment with herbal and nutritional supplementation, stress management techniques such as meditation and weight bearing exercise. The primary outcome is aimed to help decrease physical symptoms experienced, mood changes and manage a healthy weight. An implication for practice management of PMS is to consider a holistic approach, which includes nutritional and lifestyle changes that benefit the patient short and long term",

Regular physical activity is associated with increased mental wellbeing and has shown to have preventive effects on depression, anxiety disorders and probably sleep disorders. Additionally, positive effects on comorbid chronic physical diseases have been found. Exercise as treatment for several weeks has shown to have an antidepressant effect. Similar positive effects on symptoms have been found in anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Therefore, assessing and promoting physical activity is advisable in clinical psychiatric practice. Patients should be coached to reach at least a weekly average of 150 minutes of moderate and/or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity. Establishing physical activity and exercise groups is of utmost importance for psychiatric outpatients.",

Children with SAD experience intrusive worries that something might happen to the attachment figure or to child him-/herself. The core feature of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is excessive worrying related to number of events or activities that lasts for a period of six months or more. As with SAD, children with GAD have high rate of concurrent mental health disorders. Social anxiety disorder or social phobia is characterized by an excessive fear of negative evaluation by others. Often this extreme fear of judgment and evaluation is in situations with unfamiliar people or situations that could possibly result in scrutiny. Problem-solving methods are taught and practiced in order to help children identify new methods for addressing anxiety-provoking situations.",

Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

      "abstract": "Nummular headache (coin-shaped cephalgia) has an unusual distinct feature: it is characterized by mild-to-moderate pressure-like pain exclusively felt in a rounded or elliptical area typically 2-6 cm in diameter. Although any region of the head may be affected, the parietal area is the common localization of nummular headache. The pain remains confined to the same symptomatic area which does not change in shape or size with time. The pain is continuous but lancinating exacerbations lasting for several seconds or gradually increasing from 10 mins to 2 h may superimpose the baseline pain. The temporal pattern is either chronic or remitting. Pseudoremissions may be observed when the pain reaches a very low grade or only discomfort (not pain) in the affected area is reported. At times, discomfort may prevail. Either during symptomatic periods or interictally, the affected area may show a variable combination of hypoethesia, dysesthesia, paresthesia or tenderness. Physical and supplementary examinations are normal. Nummular headache emerges as a primary clear-cut clinical picture. The particular topography and signs of sensory dysfunction make it reasonable to vent the idea that nummular headache is an extracranial headache, probably stemming from epicranial tissues such as terminal branches of sensitive nerves. Nummular headache may seem to be the paradigm of epicranias (group of headaches and pericranial neuralgias stemming from epicranial tissues). Nummular headache must be distinguished from head pain secondary to local processes and from tender points of more extensive headaches. Although nummular headache may frequently coexist with other primary headaches, it has an independent course. Treatment is seldom necessary and in most cases simple reassurance is sufficient.",

BPSD are the non-cognitive features of dementia and include depression, anxiety, psychotic symptoms, apathy, irritability, aggression, and sleep and eating problems. They occur in around 80% of people with dementia at some stage, several of them becoming more frequent as dementia progresses. Some BPSD, notably apathy, are very persistent. BPSD often limit the person’s quality of life and can be stressful for carers. Causes of BPSD include biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors. This chapter explores how they are assessed and measured, and how they may usefully grouped together in symptom clusters. Usually four symptom groups are found: affective symptoms, psychosis, hyperactivity, and euphoria. However, these are not always consistent and in particular apathy does not consistently belong in one group. Approaches to management of BPSD are outlined.",

It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

Najcesce su Uvjerenja izdana na rok važenja od 2 ili 5 godina Nisu svi istraživaci složni oko odgovora na pitanje jesu li stariji vozaci rizicni, ali statistike za Hrvatsku prema podacima MUP-a govore da stariji vozaci uzrokuju 2/3 nesreca u kojima sudjeluju. Ako uzmemo u obzir da svi stariji vozaci koji su registrirani da posjeduju vozacku dozvolu ne voze, te da voze na znatno kracim relacijama, ovaj postotak je poražavajuci.\nIpak, nakon vise promjena zakona koji regulira kriterije za zdravstveni pregled vozaca , sada je na snazi zakon prema kojem je zdravstveni pregled obavezan samo ako je to navedeno u Uvjerenju dobivenom prije osposobljavanja vozaca. U europskim zemljama zdravstveni pregled je obavezan za starije vozace (Spanjolska, Velika Britanija, Svedska, Norveska), a jedino u Njemackoj je odgovornost o zdravstvenoj sposobnosti povjerena odabranom lijecniku vozaca. (11) Moguce je da ce se taj zakon uskoro opet mijenjati i možda uskladiti s nekim od europskih zakona.",

The psychosis is characterized by a very sudden onset in a setting of marked emotional turmoil with a distortion of the outside world and presence of false sensory impressions in some cases. The psychosis lasts a few weeks to a few months and is followed by a recovery. 3. Our patients are young people, in the twenties or thirties, in excellent physical health, in whom there is usually a history of a previous attack in late adolescence. 4. The prepsychotic personalities of our patients show the usual variation found in any group of people. 5. A good social and industrial adjustment, the presence of a definite and specific environmental stress, the interest in life and its opportunities, and the absence of any passivity or withdrawal are some of the factors favoring recovery.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "abstract": "All humans will undergo aging, which has significant impacts both physically and mentally. Anxiety disorders are psychiatric disorders commonly encountered in the elderly and correlate with increased health burden, morbidity, mortality, and poor quality of life. The elderly with cardiovascular and multimorbid diseases are at a higher risk of experiencing anxiety disorders. This disorder can be a continuation of previous occurrences or a first-time event. The interaction between neurobiological, psychological, and environmental factors triggers the onset of this disorder. Diagnosis enforcement is often challenging due to comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders such as depression or cognitive disorders, as well as the similarity of anxiety symptoms to symptoms caused by other medical conditions or aging. The elderly find it difficult to accurately describe and identify anxiety. Expertise is required to establish an accurate diagnosis. Unfortunately, this disorder often does not receive proper treatment, even though optimal management is crucial to improving outcomes and achieving optimal quality of life in the elderly. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches require special attention due to the impact of aging on organ function.

Un examen rapide de la mémoire met en évidence un trouble du rappel qui n’est pas amélioré par les procédures de facilitation (indiçage). La plainte « bénigne » témoigne d’un trouble du rappel : elle porte aussi bien sur le passé ancien que récent, ne s’accompagne pas de modifications du comportement ou de diminution des activités de la vie quotidienne. La gêne est essentiellement subjective et le sujet vient seul consulter. L’examen montre une disparition des difficultés de rappel par l’indiçage.

Importantly, rates are rising during the pandemic.Suicidal symptoms can develop with depression and, less commonly, with anxiety disorders.In 2019, almost 25% of girls and more than 10% of boys seriously considered suicide.Symptoms are especially common among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) youth and Black youth.If you are worried your child is thinking about self-harm, contact a health care professional immediately.Parents, teachers, and pediatric primary care clinicians can monitor for signs of depression and anxiety including school difficulties, changes in sleep or eating, getting along with friends or family, withdrawing from activities, and using screening questionnaires for depression or anxiety in health care visits.Depression and anxiety are treatable with therapy that teaches specific skills, medications, or both.Specific treatment plans de-pend on age, severity of symptoms, ability to access therapy, and family preferences.Families can take care of your own mental health, talk about feelings starting at an early age; teach and model healthy coping strategies; keep your child safe from weapons, abuse, and preventable incidents; and talk to your child's health care professional.Some family and community health strategies to prevent depressionandanxietyincludeparentsaccessingtheirownmentalhealthcare; teaching families skills for effective communication and managing feelings;introducinganti-bullyingandantidiscriminationactivities;supporting families to access basic needs like food and safe housing; and preventing exposure to extreme stresses like abuse and disasters.",

Dabei sind bis zu 150 verschiedene Symptome beschrieben worden, die diesem Syndrom zugeordnet werden konnen. Allein die Vielzahl der Symptome weist darauf hin, wie unscharf der Symptomenkomplex charakterisiert ist. We it unklarer als die klinische Beschreibung ist seine Pathophysiologie. Nach klinischen Gesichtspunkten spricht man von einem pramenstruellen Syndrom, wenn es urn die Beschreibung von psychischen oder somatischen Beschwerden geht, die pramenstruell auftreten und postmenstruell vollig verschwinden (Dalton 1985). Das pramenstruelle Syndrom war offensichtlich schon im klassischen Altertum bekannt. Bereits Hippokrates bezog Veranderungen der Gemiltslage in der pramenstruellen Phase auf ein Verhalten des Regelbluts. Die Regelblutung wurde als ReinigungsprozeB des Korpers und der Seele aufgefaBt. Zu den soma tisch en Beschwerden, die im Rahmen des pramenstruellen Syndroms gesehen werden, gehort die Odemneigung mit Gewichtszunahme, Brustspannen mit Mastodynie, Vollegefilhl mit Obstipationsneigung und Ubelkeit. Bei den psychovegetativen Symptomen stehen erhohte Reizbarkeit, Aggressivitat, Stimmungslabilitat, Angstlichkeit, Antriebsarmut, Schlaflosigkeit, Appetitveranderungen, gesteigerter Durst, Libidobeeintrachtigung, Konzentrationsund Koordinationsschwache im Vordergrund. Die Wesensveranderung kann so we it reichen, daB Kleptomanie, Pyromanie, Trunksucht, Nymphomanie und Halluzinationen beobachtet werden. Das pramenstruelle Syndrom gilt in GroBbritannien als strafmildern, in Frankreich gar als zeitweilige Unzurechnungsfahigkeit. Hinsichtlich der Pathophysiologie des pramenstruellen Syndroms gibt es eine Reihe von Hypothesen. Der zeitliche Zusammenhang zwischen der Menstruation und dem Auftreten dieses Syndroms lieB vermuten, daB eine gesWrte Ovarialfunktion mit veranderter Relation von Ostrogenund Progesteronsekretion ursachlich verantwortlich zu machen sei (Backstrom et al. 1976). Eine unzureichende sekretorische Umwandlung des J::ndometriums machte einen relativen Progesteronmangel zusatzlich wahrscheinlich. Damit wurde gleichzeitig ein relatives Uberwiegen der Ostrogenwirkung angenommen. Die gilnstigen therapeutischen Wirkungen einer Progesteronsubstitution schienen diese Hypothese zu bestatigen. In klinischen Studien, in denen serienmaBig Plasmaspiegel von Ostradiol und Progesteron bestimmt wurden, zeigte sich, daB das pramenstruelle Syndrom sowohl bei ovulatorischen als auch bei anovulatorischen Zyklen auftreten kann (Reid u. Yen 1981). Kritisch ist bei",

This is something that is very often reported by patients. It is quite normal to have these problems. They do not mean that there is any permanent brain damage. These problems will get less as your health improves. Research has shown that the degree of difficulty in things such as short-term memory and concentration vary to some extent with your level of fatigue, and with how ill you are feeling. Though these problems can be infuriating (and at times extremely inconvenient), they are not something to fear.",

The physician should rule out three psychiatric disorders in which unexplained physical symptoms often dominate the clinical picture. These are hysteria, anxiety neurosis, and depression. Each is a definite syndrome with specific diagnostic criteria and a well-documented natural history. Hysteria and anxiety neurosis often can be managed as successfully by an internist or general practitioner as by a psychiatrist. Depression more often justifies a psychiatric referral. \"Functional\" symptoms which cannot be attributed to one of these syndromes often warrant further search for an organic cause.",

      "title": "Just Sit Still and Pay Attention?—A Commentary",
      "abstract": "Physical activity is one of many factors that influence the growth and development of children, but only about 24% of children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years participate in the recommended amount of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily.1 A large body of evidence indicates that regular physical activity has numerous benefits for physical, mental, and cognitive health2 and insufficient physical activity can be detrimental to the overall health of young people, with increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic diseases.3 Beyond chronic diseases, physical activity may help to ameliorate stress, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, problem behavior, and may improve overall well-being.3 Socially, children can develop resilience skills through physically active play and sports.4 They also learn to make decisions, develop intrinsic interests, regulate emotions, and solve problems.5 Although it is commonly understood that the musculoskeletal, metabolic, and cardiovascular bodily systems require the stimulus of physical activity to develop and function effectively, the central nervous system also benefits when children are physically active.2 Young people who are more physically active have a greater attention span, faster cognitive processing speed, and higher overall performance on standardized academic tests, compared to those who are not as active.2 Children who struggle academically in school may not necessarily need additional classroom time; it could be physical activity that they need.6 Maintaining focus for a 7-hour period with minimal breaks can be challenging for younger students. In a randomized controlled study designed to evaluate the influence of classroom physical activity breaks, time-on-task was significantly higher in students after a 10-minute classroom physical activity break, compared to a sedentary control group.6 Physical activity breaks taken throughout the school day may improve children's ability to focus on classroom tasks, possibly leading to better learning outcomes. Unfortunately, in many schools, physical activity opportunities are often traded for additional classroom time.7 Although spending additional time on physical activity instead of academic subjects is often presumed to decrease student performance, a review of quasi-experimental studies concluded that the addition of 1 hour of physical activity into the school curriculum did not negatively affect the academic achievement of students, and that additional curricular emphasis on physical education could result in better grades.8 Physical activity may actually improve learning, as it enhances students' ability to understand, retain, and apply the information they are taught.9 In a meta-analysis of 26 studies of the relationship between physical activity and test scores, results showed significant, positive correlations between activity and academic performance for language, math, reading, and on-task behavior.10 Furthermore, physical activity is positively associated with years of college education and overall higher grades throughout the duration of formal schooling.11 Physical activity has been largely engineered out of the daily lives of children through advancements in technology and other societal influences. Outside school, children often have continual access to video games, television, cellular phones, and other devices, spending around 5-7 hours/day on a digital screen.12 Because children spend a large proportion of their waking hours in attendance, schools are in a unique position to help or hinder opportunities for physical activity. Students have potential opportunities to obtain school-related physical activity in several contexts: physical education, recess, classroom activities, before or after school activities, and via active transportation to or from school.5 Thus, there are several contexts where opportunities could be developed, improved, or better leveraged for the promotion of children's physical activity. Prioritizing academic emphasis over physical activity is understandable—given schools' educational mission—but what seems far worse is the purposeful withholding of physical activity, often done for behavioral management purposes.13 The American Academy of Pediatrics has actively discouraged withholding physical activity; nevertheless, school personnel frequently restrict or withhold recess or other active opportunities.13, 14 In 2006, researchers found that more than 80% of elementary schools allowed the restriction of recess, purportedly to strengthen academic performance or classroom management.15 Almost 80% of principals reported that their schools continue to take recess away from students as a form of discipline for undesirable behavior,1 and children who lose the opportunity to be physically active during school are unlikely to compensate for that loss after school.16 When it comes to other health promoting behaviors, educators and administrators recognize the importance of providing students with nutritious meals to accompany learning. They admit that without proper nourishment, it is very difficult for children to be academically successful. Although the practice of withholding lunch for behavior management purposes or pressure to achieve high test scores would never be tolerated, withholding physical activity has been allowed, despite clearly being necessary and beneficial for children. Recess, for instance, provides a context important not only for children to be physically active, but also to learn physical, social, and emotional skills.17 When children lose their recess or free play opportunities, children lose opportunities for physical activity, self-expression, creative play, and are deprived of the ability to develop important skills necessary for adulthood.7, 18 Withholding, restricting, or imposing excessive limits on physical activity deserve serious scrutiny, because failure to obtain adequate amounts of physical activity—and to let kids spend time playing as they learn—has the potential to hinder the overall development, health, and academic success of children. Physical activity is an important component of the school day and helping children to reach their full potential—cognitively, physically, socially, and emotionally—should be prized. Policy and law may be helping to change the landscape for physical activity in schools. In 2015, the No Child Left Behind Act was replaced by the Every Student Succeeds Act,19 which holds schools accountable for students' academic performances. For the first time, however, the definition of a well-rounded education also included health and physical education.19 Since the implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, schools have been tasked with making improvements to wellness policies that deal not only with nutritional standards and practices, but also with physical activity.20 Although many school districts have struggled to comply with this law, implementation frameworks such as School Wellness Integration Targeting Child Health (SWITCH) can facilitate the process for school wellness leaders to deliver evidence-based interventions to promote physical activity and other wellness components.21 Beyond policy, the educational culture seems to be shifting toward an appreciation of physical activity, and there has been a recent focus on what is termed “physical literacy,” defined as maximizing individual attributes and the development of the whole child, physically and psychologically, to lead a physically active and healthy lifestyle.22 Physical literacy takes into account the influence of school curriculum, home environments, and community settings. A comprehensive approach that embraces physical literacy is vital to the development of physically active children, and its advocates suggest that educators and parents come together to create a physically literate culture that makes physically active lifestyles the norm.22 Learning how and why movement is beneficial helps to establish the purposeful and meaningful connections needed to facilitate the development of skills and capabilities to incorporate physical activity into young students' lives. Physical activity is a vital component within the lives of children, and vital to a comprehensive, well-rounded education. Physical activity has the ability to impact children's academics, life-long health, and overall well-being, and schools have opportunity to contribute positively to the physical activity needs of children without compromising their educational mandate. According to the most recent US report card on physical activity for children and youth, American schools received a grade of D- on physical activity support, as only 20–26% of schools are currently excelling by creating active school policies, offering quality physical education, and taking advantage of physical activity opportunities.1 The guiding question is: “What can schools do?” The Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program offers a free resource, developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,23 that helps schools develop and adopt a multi-component approach to instill the knowledge, skills, and confidence in students to be physically active for a lifetime. This model encourages schools to create or take advantage of existing opportunities for students to be physically active. Schools that adopt a Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program make it more possible for students to achieve the nationally recommended 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day,3 of which at least 30 minutes are recommended to be obtained during the school day.2 Physical education classes make important contributions, but most classes are likely to provide about 10-20 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity,2 leaving roughly half of the recommended 30 minutes to be obtained during other parts of the school day—such as during recess, classroom activities, before or after school activities, and via active transportation to or from school. In accordance with Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program, school personnel can consider several of the following recommendations for promoting physical activity. Here are 8 specific implications for school health, with suggestions to promote children's physical activity in schools. (1) Develop school and school district policies that prohibit using exercise or physical activity as punishment, using restriction or withholding of recess as a tactic for behavior management. School districts should ensure administrator support and provide teacher training around these policies, including alternative tactics for behavior management. (2) Build physical activity breaks into classroom lessons, using resources such as online videos available through GoNoodle (https://www.gonoodle.com/) or Brain Breaks (www.unicefkidpower.org/brain-breaks-for-kids/). These should be easy to implement, integrated into academic concepts, and last about 5 minutes or less.24 (3) Develop or advocate for policies that ensure children receive 150 or more minutes of weekly physical education during school. (4) Promote active transportation through bike-to-school days, walking school buses,25 or through supportive policies and infrastructure. School-community partnerships can develop and implement interventions to replace automobile transportation with walking or biking to school, and promote safety. Infrastructure development (such as additional sidewalks or cross walks), or recruitment of volunteers to lead active transportation, such as a walking school bus. (5) Assign physically active homework where appropriate. (6) Allocate 20 or more minutes of daily recess during the school day. For inclement weather, school staff should develop indoor recess plans that are nearly as conducive to physical activity as outdoor recess. (7) Add sessions of physical activity into before-school or after-school programming. Staff should consider options such as supervised free play, simple structured games, or opportunities to sample various sports. (8) Offer intramural sports or running and walking clubs, including student family member participation also. In addition to the above suggestions, schools should work to improve the quality of offerings by providing SAAFE26 physical activity programs, policies, and practices. SAAFE stands for supportive, active, autonomous, fair, and enjoyable.26 Physical activity opportunities should be supportive of children's psychological needs, as well as active, with more movement, and less sitting or standing. Opportunities should be autonomous, allowing children to make some of their own choices. They should be fair, so that all types of kids have opportunity to participate. Last, they should be enjoyable, so physical activity is not used as punishment or to socially isolate children. In conclusion, students in school should not passively “just sit still and pay attention.” Placing value and emphasis on physical activity can bolster schools' healthy norms, creating a supportive culture for student success and better quality of life for all.27 As adult decision makers, we all have a role to play in bringing up the poor (D-) grade that our schools have earned for physical activity support, as we endeavor to help children succeed academically, physically, socially, and emotionally, now and well into the future.",

      "abstract": "Secondary depression is common among primary alcoholics. However, its aetiology is poorly understood.Forty men with primary alcoholism, abstinent for two weeks or more, with a secondary major depressive episode were compared with forty matched never-depressed primary alcoholic controls for risk factors for depression and recent life events.In the six months before the onset of depression depressed alcoholics had experienced significantly more life events, more life events with negative impact, more dependent events caused by alcohol, and more independent events. Significantly more depressed alcoholics than controls had a family history of depression, a family history of suicidal behaviour and had themselves attempted suicide.Having recent life events, particularly events with negative impact, and a family history of depression are risk factors for secondary depression in alcoholics.",

      "abstract": "Definition of somatoform disorders: somatic symptoms or mental symptoms? Somatoform disorders, which used to be considered as mental disorders, are frequent, especially in the context of non-psychiatric medical consultations. The absence of an identifiable organic cause for these disorders often leads clinicians to underestimates their harmful consequences or even challenge their validity as disease. However, they are real disorders that may have a major impact on the quality of life and functional outcomes of the subject and whose mechanisms can be targeted by therapeutic interventions. Although psychiatric classifications support a unitary approach (i.e. the \"somatic symptom disorder and related disorders\" of the American Psychiatric Association's DSM - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - or the \"bodily distress disorder\" of the World Health Organization), each non-psychiatric specialty has described some \"functional somatic syndromes\", which are deemed more specific and less severe regarding psychiatric severity, and thus more often remain in the field of non-psychiatric specialties. In this article, we have presented the initial stage of any medical approach of suffering: a clarification of the issues involved in the delimitation of the normal and the pathological, and the organization of the different categories between them. These nosographic aspects are the condition of a rigorous approach in medicine, and of a relationship with the patient that is useful to understand and relieve his or her genuine suffering.Définition des troubles somatoformes : entre symptômes physiques et symptômes mentaux. Les troubles somatoformes, considérés comme des troubles mentaux par la nosographie psychiatrique, sont particulièrement fréquents, mais surtout rencontrés dans le contexte des consultations médicales non psychiatriques. L’absence de cause organique identifiable pour ces maladies fait souvent sous-estimer leur retentissement, voire douter de leur existence. Il s’agit pourtant de troubles à part entière, avec un impact majeur sur la qualité de vie et les activités des sujets en souffrant et avec des mécanismes accessibles à la thérapeutique. Si la nosographie psychiatrique contemporaine privilégie une approche unitaire (« troubles à symptomatologie somatique et apparentés » du Manuel diagnostique et statistique des troubles mentaux, « bodily distress disorder » de l’Organisation mondiale de la santé), chaque spécialité a décrit un ou plusieurs « syndromes somatiques fonctionnels » qui, du fait de leur spécificité présumée et de leur sévérité psychiatrique moins grande, restent le plus souvent du domaine des spécialités non psychiatriques. Dans cet article est présentée l’étape initiale à toute approche médicale de la souffrance : une clarification des enjeux de la définition du normal et du pathologique et de l’organisation des différentes catégories nosographiques entre elles. Ces aspects nosographiques sont la condition d’une approche rigoureuse en médecine et d’une relation avec le patient qui soit utile à la compréhension et au soulagement de sa souffrance.",

The most common age for these symptoms to occur is 4-6 yr, after the child is toilet trained, and the vast majority are boys. This condition is termed the daytime frequency syndrome of childhood or Pollakiuria. The condition is functional no anatomic problem is detected. The symptoms occur often just before a child starts kindergarten or if the child is having emotional family stress-related problems. OCD is a chronically disabling illness characterized by repetitive, ritualistic behaviors over which the patient has little or no control. OCD has a lifetime prevalence of 1-3% worldwide, and as many as 80% of all cases have their onset in childhood and adolescence. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between OCD and Pollakiuria. \r\nMaterials and Methods:In this case-control study, we evaluated (152) children aged 6-18 years old who were visited in the pediatric clinics of Amir-Kabir Hospital, Arak, Iran. The control group considered of (76) healthy children and the case group included (76) age and sex matched children with Pollakiuria. Then, the children’s behavioral status was evaluated using the children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (C-YBOCS). The C-YBOCS is helpful in identifying children with OCD. The data was analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics in SPSS-16. \r\nResults: OCD was detected in (5) case (6.6%) with Pollakiuria and (8) controls (10.5%). The difference in OCD was not significant (p-value 0.282) between the two groups.\r\nConclusion: OCD isn’t more common in Pollakiuria versus non-Pollakiuria children. It is recommended to conduct a study with higher sample volume in order to detect the relationship between OCD and Pollakiuria.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Child, Obsessive-Compulsive disorder, Pollakiuria",

These include low socioeconomic status, life stressors, inadequate social support, vulnerable personality traits, medical conditions, vasomotor symptoms, psychiatric history, health history, reproductive-related factors, childhood abuse and family history and genetics. Few are specific or unique to psychiatric morbidity during the menopausal transition. Those that may be more prevalent or limiting during this period of life than prior to it include vasomo-tor symptoms, life stressors, and increased physical problems. The extent to which the physical and biological changes during the transition make women more vulnerable to the effects of factors such as low social support, a tendency to ruminate, or a history of childhood abuse are not known.",

The chief symptoms are those of anxiety and its physical concomitants in the absence of other illness and independent of specific situations; they include breathing and swallowing difficulties, palpitations, dizziness, irritability, and faintness. Depression, phobias, and obsessions are common complications. The syndrome occurs in young adults of both sexes and its course may be acute or chronic. Acute forms may present in epidemics which are culture bound, e.g., Koro and epidemic hysteria. Chronic forms can fluctuate and persist for many years without other physical or psychiatric syndromes appearing. Between attacks the patient feels fairly well. Prevalence is estimated at 2 to 5 per cent of the normal population and 6 to 27 per cent of psychiatric outpatients. The syndrome requires differentiation from depressive and phobic disorders and from physical conditions which produce anxiety.",

The features of posttraumatic headache may vary, but the most distressing type is the chronic daily headache. This study evaluates occurrence of chronic daily headache in relation to the intensity of head injury.All patients with head injury who were seen by the senior author (J.R.C.) in the Southern Illinois University Medical School (SIUMS) Neurology Clinic between 1980 and 1991 were identified from the SIUMS headache registry. Data on headache status before and after head injury was obtained, and patients with more than one headache per week before head injury were excluded. Each patient's headache status at the time of the clinic visit was classified as chronic daily headache (headache occurring at least 5 of 7 days for 6 months), intermittent migraine, or no headache. Head injury severity was graded by duration of loss of consciousness or amnesia as minimal (less than 5 minutes), mild (5 to 60 minutes), moderate (1 to 24 hours), or severe (more than 24 hours).There was an inverse relation between extent of head injury and occurrence of chronic daily headache. For minimal head injury (n = 54), 80% had chronic daily headache, and 11% had no headache, while for moderate/severe head injury (n = 23), only 27% had chronic daily headache, and 68% had no headache (P<.001, chi2).This study suggests that the risk of developing posttraumatic chronic daily headache is greater for less severe head injury compared with moderate/severe head injury. The reason for this relation is unclear.",

Bireylerin sağlığını etkilediği gibi yaşam kalitelerini de etkileyen önemli bir olaydır. Uyku kalitesi ise bireylerin kendilerini zihinsel ve bedensel olarak iyi hissetmesidir. Uyku kalitesi kronik hastalık varlığı, stres, yaşam stili, çevresel faktörler, ekonomik durum, iş ve sosyal yaşam gibi birçok faktörden etkilenmektedir. Özellikle psikolojik stres ve uyku sorunları birbirleriyle çift yönlü bir ilişkiye sahiptir. Stres faktörleri uyku kalitesini etkilerken, uyku kalitesinin düşük olması da psikolojik semptomları kötüleştirebilir. İnfertilite tanı ve tedavi sürecinde uyku sorunlarının meydana geldiği yapılan çalışmalar ile gösterilmiştir.

      "title": "Psychological and Psychiatric Triggers and Risk Factors for Stroke",
      "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that psychiatric and/or psychological factors could be independent risk factors for stroke. Some of these factors may act as stroke triggers producing short-term physiological changes that may directly lead to stroke onset. Most data is related to four distinct domains: (1) depression and/or anxiety and related syndromes, (2) personality and character traits, (3) psychological stress, and (4) psychotropic medication. Some factors (e.g., depression) are closely related to stroke risk, and there is some evidence that psychological stress could be an important risk factor. However, many studies have methodological limitations (small sample size, lack of adjustment for stroke risk factors, or residual confounding) and lack of standardized definition and/or measurement. Data about stroke triggers is scarce but epidemiological studies suggest a triggering effect of acute or subacute life stress exposure. The potential pathophysiological ways by which psychiatric and/or psychological factors may promote stroke include a higher frequency of unhealthy behaviors and direct biological effects on the cardiovascular system, notably through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. More research is still needed to improve measurement and to better investigate the impact of psychiatric and/or psychological factors. The clarification of pathophysiological mechanisms could help to consider preventive strategies.",

Im Vordergrund stehen chronische Muskel- und Gelenkschmerzen, verbunden mit einer starken körperlichen und geistigen Erschöpfung nach Stress und körperlicher Belastung. Ausgeprägte Tages-Müdigkeit mit erhöhtem Schlafbedürfnis. Trotz überlanger Schlafphasen keine Erholung. Dazu kommen periodische Bauchschmerzen, Lymphknotenschwellungen, besonders nächtliches Schwitzen und Frieren ohne Fieber, instabile Kreislaufregulation mit hyper- sowie hypotonen Phasen und orthostatische Intoleranz mit Raynoud-Phänomen. Eine Infektanfälligkeit signalisiert Störungen der Immunabwehr. Zur diagnostischen Sicherung der Erkrankung gibt es keinen typischen klinischen, biochemischen oder genetischen Einzelbefund. Die Diagnose wird über ein umfangreiches internationales Konsensus-Dokument gesichert, aber erst nach sicherem Ausschluss genetisch determinierter und endokrinologischer Erkrankungen. Letztlich ist noch eine psychosomatische Komponente auszuschließen.",

      "title": "El déficit cognitivo en el síndrome de fatiga crónica: factores asociados y evolución",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION: El Sindrome de Fatiga Cronica (SFC) se define como una fatiga intensa, de etiologia desconocida que dura mas de 6 meses e interfiere en la calidad de vida del paciente. Ademas de estos sintomas, se acompana de problemas de memoria y concentracion, odinofagia, adenopatia cervical o axilar dolorosa, mialgia, cefalea de inicio reciente o de caracteristicas diferentes de la habitual, poliartralgia sin signos inflamatorios, sueno no reparador y malestar postesfuerzo que dura mas de 24 horas (Fukuda et al., 1994). Alrededor del 90% de los pacientes refiere deficits cognitivos (Jason et al., 1999), siendo una de las principales causas de discapacidad funcional. Los estudios neuropsicologicos constatan algunos de estos deficits, siendo los resultados mas consistentes en velocidad de procesamiento de informacion y atencion (Cockshell y Mathias, 2010; Michiels y Cluydts, 2001). La etiologia y el alcance del deficit continua siendo desconocida. Una de las hipotesis es la que sugiere que las alteraciones cognitivas son secundarias a los trastornos emocionales habitualmente presentes en el SFC. Tambien surge la preocupacion acerca de la evolucion del deficit sobre todo por parte del enfermo, a pesar de la escasa atencion recibida por parte de la comunidad cientifica. Finalmente, se desconoce el papel de otros factores, como la propia fatiga, en la disfuncion. Teniendo en cuenta estos datos, la presente tesis presenta como objetivos: determinar el perfil de afectacion cognitiva asociado al SFC, analizar la evolucion del deficit y los factores asociados. Para ello se realizaron tres articulos.\nMETODO: Se selecciono una muestra de mujeres con SFC mayores de 18 anos. Se realizo una entrevista clinica y una evaluacion neuropsicologica. Las puntuaciones directas fueron transformadas a puntuaciones T, tomando como referencia baremos poblacionales propios que habian sido validados previamente. Se considero deficit una puntuacion T<40.\nRESULTADOS: Mas del 50% de los pacientes presentaron deficits en atencion y funcionamiento psicomotor y el 40% en velocidad de procesamiento y funciones ejecutivas. No se observaron diferencias a nivel cognitivo entre los dos grupos de pacientes con SFC con y sin depresion. Cuando los pacientes se dividieron por grupos en funcion de la duracion de la enfermedad, tampoco hubo diferencias entre ellos en terminos de funcion cognitiva. El analisis de regresion mostro que la fatiga predijo los deficits de atencion y funcionamiento ejecutivo, y los factores emocionales predijeron el rendimiento en memoria verbal.\nCONCLUSIONES: En base a estos datos, se concluyo que los pacientes con SFC presentaron deficits cognitivos principalmente en atencion, velocidad de procesamiento, funcionamiento psicomotor y ejecutivo. La depresion no explico dichos deficits cognitivos. Tampoco se observo un empeoramiento de los deficits con la duracion de la enfermedad. Finalmente, dichos deficits parecen ser explicados por mecanismos fisiopatologicos de la propia enfermedad (fatiga). Una implicacion clinica de estos resultados, podria ser la implantacion de programas de rehabilitacion cognitiva para paliar el impacto de dichos deficits en la calidad de vida de estos pacientes.",

It is of equal importance compared with others in the 21st century. Stress management is a common phenomenon globally. The imbalance of any occasion creates stress. The most significant factors include separated from family, loneliness, fatigue, multi-nationality, limited recreation activity, and dissatisfaction of job opportunity, which tends to cause healthcare issues, especially sleep deprivation and depression. The long-lasting stress causes chronic mental fatigue. It has positive and negative impacts, which depend on situations. Sometimes it plays as a motivating factor for peak performance and great opportunity, or sometimes negative like when a person faces social, physical, organizational, and emotional problems.",

MDD is characterised by periods of depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure that lasts at least two weeks. These symptoms are accompanied by a number of somatic symptoms (changes in sleep, libido, energy and vigour, appetite and psychomotor function, etc) as well as cognitive symptoms (feelings of worthlessness, concentration or decision making difficulty, poor concentration and suicidal thoughts) that cause clinically significant distress or impairment of everyday functionality.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. During mood swings, there may be features of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) that are mood-congruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

      "abstract": "Typically, the anxiety is manageable and since it occurs under only certain conditions, it usually doesn't have life-altering consequences. Anxiety disorder can refer to several related conditions that differ with respect to their features, course, underlying processes, and treatment. These disorders, which can begin in childhood, affect about 15–20 percent of individuals, being about twice as common in females relative to males. This chapter discusses various anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social phobia and social anxiety. Of the various anxiety disorders, one that seems particularly puzzling is panic disorder. The neurochemical processes thought to be associated with panic disorder are the same as those associated with other anxiety-related disorders. OCD is characterized by repetitive obsessions that may comprise persistent, distressing and intrusive thoughts or images, together with compulsions or urges to perform specific acts or rituals.",

      "abstract": "The term “pain” originates from the Latin word “poena” meaning a fine, a penalty. It is a hostile impression that can range from mild, localized discomfort to agony. Usually the pain that persists for more than 6 months duration is known as a chronic pain. It is a poorly defined condition. Chronic pain may occur in the whole body, or in the brain or spinal cord. It is difficult to treat due to its complex natural history, unclear etiology, and poor response to therapy. It disturbs the quality of life of the patient to a great extent. Yoga is a simple and very cost-effective technique, which relieves the pain both physically and psychologically. Yogasanas improves blood circulation, facilitating muscle tension and by concentrating the mind on the breath, Asanas combine to comfort the nervous system. Long-term profits include condensed stress and anxiety levels, and amplified feelings of tranquilizing and well-being. Yoga therapy is non-expensive and quite effective in various manners. It can be used in every patient with chronic pain. Keywords: Asana , pain, Pranayama, Yoga Cite this Article Pareek A, Verma K. Effect of Yoga in Management of Chronic Pain .

      "abstract": "Abstract Status epilepticus (SE) is a prolonged, self-sustained seizure that can manifest as a prolonged convulsion, subtle facial or limb twitching, or simply altered mental status, always in association with a persistent electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure pattern. In clinical trials, convulsive seizures lasting longer than 5 min are often treated as SE,1 whereas epidemiological studies have defined 30 min of continuous convulsive seizures or intermittent seizures without recovery of consciousness as SE.2 There are 126,000 to 195,000 episodes of SE associated with 22,000 to 42,000 deaths each year in the United States when SE is defined as 30 min of seizures.2 As many as 50% of patients older than 65 years of age who suffer from SE die within 30 days of the episode. Although mortality is far less common in younger patients, they are at risk for neurological morbidity, such as injury to the hippocampus3 and neuropsychological dysfunction.4 Prolonged seizures can also lead to significant systemic complications, including pulmonary congestion and edema, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, elevation of body temperature, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and rhabdomylosis. These systemic complications tend to worsen as more seizures occur.5 It has long been recognized that SE is a dynamic and rapidly evolving condition.5,6 Ongoing seizures rapidly modify neuronal activity and synaptic function.7 This rapid neuronal plasticity is manifest in changes in behavioral seizures, EEG patterns, sensitivity to drugs, and evolution of neuronal injury and death. Although these changes are continuous, it is convenient to divide SE into stages for the purposes of investigation and treatment (Table 41–1).",

In addition she displayed evidences of organic brain dysfunction: impaired visual-motor and visual-perceptual functions, and abnormality of the electroencephalogram. Within days the most florid evidences of disturbance had disappeared but the thinking disorder, distortion of body image, and depression of intelligence quotient persisted for several months. At the end of five months the only residua were the abnormal EEG and disorganization of visual-motor functions. At the end of nine months only the visualmotor functions remained impaired.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Some people with CFS/ME also suffer from anxiety, panic, or depression, and you are certainly not alone if you do experience this sort of thing. You may perhaps have had a tendency for this kind of problem before you got ill, or it may be a new and unwelcome burden. Anxiety and panic are very unpleasant to experience, and produce physical symptoms; anything you can do to control these emotional states will be of benefit to your general well-being. Feeling really anxious most of the time will certainly put added pressure on your body. Panic attacks can be exhausting, leaving you feeling really ill afterwards. Depression can also cause physical symptoms, make fatigue worse, and reduce your motivation, making managing your illness harder.",

      "title": "Suffering and the Dying Patient",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

The interviewer should make sure that any “yes” response is not simply caused by exposure to a certain situation or object (Specific Phobia), being the focus of attention (Social Anxiety Disorder/Social Phobia), being separated from parents (Separation Anxiety), and so on. If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

It represents an efficient system of information introducing or evoking a series of defensive mechanisms concerning acute illness, whereas the chronic ache is senseless, because it doesn't take over any protective functions; on the contrary, it burdens the total organism, especially the vegetativum and the psyche as well. Chronic pain very often renders independent, then it is no longer any symptom of a disease, but the disease itself: the idiopathic or unspecific syndrome of pain. Analyzing, for example, rheumatological aspects of a case, you can recognise that there exist continuous transitions from concrete local pain to diffuse indefinite psychalgia, whilst that gliding scale is more and more defined by psychic causes. Many aspects of cases imply a lot of such components. Obviously those syndromes of diseases are increasing where only pure psychosomatic facts exist, that is to say when soma is not the primary source but the scenery.",

      "abstract": "Parmi les problématiques psychiques susceptibles d’entraver ou de soutenir le traitement des conflits engagés par l’expérience du vieillissement et/ou du handicap, la question des identifications sexuelles se révèle nodale. En effet, outre la question identitaire, des assises narcissiques et de la différenciation moi/non moi, la question des identifications secondaires mobilisées par les différences des sexes et des générations se révèle être une dynamique majeure du rapport que toute personne peut entretenir avec son corps. Le vécu des limitations liées à l’expérience du handicap, et de celles, plus communes, liées à la traversée du vieillissement et de la vieillesse – qu’elles soient brutales ou insidieuses, aiguës ou chroniques –, entretient des rapports complexes avec les fantasmes de castration et de passivité. L’expérience de psychothérapies analytiques d’hommes qui, pour cause accidentelle traumatique (chute, accident de la voie publique), ou pour cause de fragilité somatique (accident vasculaire cérébral), se retrouvent en situation de handicap (avec des séquelles plus ou moins invalidantes) et vieillissent ainsi, permet de discerner combien la question des identifications féminines joue un rôle capital dans l’élaboration des conflits psychiques inhérents à cette rencontre entre vieillissement et handicap. L’auteur propose d’illustrer cette question clinique par l’exposé des grandes étapes de la psychothérapie d’un homme de 75 ans qui permet de saisir comment la rigidité puis la souplesse des identifications sexuelles, de la revendication de la puissance à la possibilité d’y renoncer au profit de l’acceptation d’une certaine passivité-jouissance, organisent, gênent ou élaborent le conflit psychique et, partant, les relations aux proches, aux enfants, aux femmes et aux hommes.",

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common mental disorder that involves constant and chronic tension, worrying and nervousness. In India GAD has high prevalence of 5.8%. Compared to a panic attack, its intensity is less but chronicity is longer. GAD makes the person exhausted mentally and physically and makes problems emotionally and behaviorally affecting the quality of life badly because functional somatic symptoms in GAD shows a wide range. In Ayurveda, the symptoms of GAD shows characteristics of Chittodwega and indicates a very effective management. A 25 year old male attended in OPD with increased tension, fear and uncontrollable anxiety, disturbed sleep, and stomach ailments, constipation, belching and reduced appetite. On interrogation it was revealed that he developed the symptoms over the last 2 years. Mental status examination was done. Considering the signs and symptoms, he was diagnosed with GAD. Internally he was given with Somalatha Choorna, Aswagandharishta, Gokshura Choorna, Aswagandha Choorna and Sarpagandha Choorna to manage his anxiety and stomach ailments. Procedures done were Thala Pothichil, Snehapana, Virechana and Nasya to reduce his anxiety and other problems. During this time, he was also subjected to meditation and counselling techniques as well. The patient responded well to the treatment and his symptoms improved significantly. HAM-A scale score before treatment was 24 which was reduced to 6 after treatment. On discharge he was advised to continue the medicines and relaxation techniques. The Ayurveda protocol was found to be effective in managing GAD and highlights the importance of ayurvedic psychiatric treatments in similar conditions.",

Some children may have persistent physical discomfort which can lead to debilitating impact on their academic and social functioning. These children seek repeated medical consultations and are usually subjected to unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures. It is extremely important to understand that emotional factors can contribute to the development as well as maintenance of impairing physical symptoms. There is scientific evidence for the association of anxiety and functional somatic symptoms in children. The diagnostic category which was previously called somatoform disorders is now included in somatic symptom disorders. The main feature of the somatic symptom disorders is the excessive concern with somatic symptoms. These children usually have high level of anxiety. Detailed clinical examination and investigations will not reveal any abnormalities to explain the symptoms. The somatic symptom disorders are common in childhood. Cognitive behavioural therapy by experts in child guidance, will relieve the somatic symptoms related to anxiety and stress. If not intervened at the earliest, the persistent physical symptoms associated with emotional stress will cause significant functional disability in childhood. Unnecessary invasive medical interventions cause more agony to the child. These children also have high risk for developing anxiety disorders and depressive disorders in young adulthood. Hence, early intervention using cognitive behavioural techniques should be provided to all children with somatic symptom disorders, which will definitely improve their quality of life.",

One of older adults' well-known problems relates to the fact that their quality of life can be threatened by physical health stresses and associated depressive symptomatology. Common health problems among older adults often contribute to depressive symptomatology, and, in turn, depressive symptoms may further compromise older adults' health. It is thus an important task to discover factors that can protect older adults from experiencing the negative emotional consequences of health stresses. Using ideas from the life-span theory of control, we show how to adaptively manage the negative consequences of health problems in the elderly. Active investments in overcoming health problems that are controllable should result in positive outcomes. In contrast, it may be beneficial for older adults to disengage from health goals that are unattainable. By adjusting their control-related behaviors to the controllability of specific health stresses, older adults can maintain their psychological and physical health.",

Hal ini berimplikasi pada perlunya pemantauan dan pengobatan jangka panjang, bahkan pada beberapa kasus seumur hidup. Pada pasien penyakit kronis, depresi akan mempengaruhi cara pasien memandang dan menerima (cope) penyakit fisik yang dialami, serta menentukan bagaimana pasien berinteraksi dengan keluarga, dokter penyakit dalam, juga dengan pengobatan yang harus secara rutin dijalani pasien.",

Besides the physiological vertigo produced by rapid rotatory movements or by a sojourn in high places, temporary pathological giddiness or dizziness is not uncommon with many persons enjoying, in other respects, good health. In fact, there is scarcely an adult but has not, at one or the other period of his life, experienced vertigo of some kind. Whereas, then, vertiginous sensations may be said to fall within the boundary lines of health, they may constitute a well-marked disease and rise to the dignity of a pathological entity, if they are severe or persistent enough to interfere with the comfort or occupation of the individual so affected.

      "abstract": "The term functional somatic syndrome has been applied to several related syndromes characterized more by symptoms, suffering, and disability than by consistently demonstrable tissue abnormality. These syndromes include multiple chemical sensitivity, the sick building syndrome, repetition stress injury, the side effects of silicone breast implants, the Gulf War syndrome, chronic whiplash, the chronic fatigue syndrome, the irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia. Patients with functional somatic syndromes have explicit and highly elaborated self-diagnoses, and their symptoms are often refractory to reassurance, explanation, and standard treatment of symptoms. They share similar phenomenologies, high rates of co-occurrence, similar epidemiologic characteristics, and higher-than-expected prevalences of psychiatric comorbidity. Although discrete pathophysiologic causes may ultimately be found in some patients with functional somatic syndromes, the suffering of these patients is exacerbated by a self-perpetuating, self-validating cycle in which common, endemic, somatic symptoms are incorrectly attributed to serious abnormality, reinforcing the patient's belief that he or she has a serious disease. Four psychosocial factors propel this cycle of symptom amplification: the belief that one has a serious disease; the expectation that one's condition is likely to worsen; the \"sick role,\" including the effects of litigation and compensation; and the alarming portrayal of the condition as catastrophic and disabling. The climate surrounding functional somatic syndromes includes sensationalized media coverage, profound suspicion of medical expertise and physicians, the mobilization of parties with a vested self-interest in the status of functional somatic syndromes, litigation, and a clinical approach that overemphasizes the biomedical and ignores psychosocial factors. All of these influences exacerbate and perpetuate the somatic distress of patients with functional somatic syndromes, heighten their fears and pessimistic expectations, prolong their disability, and reinforce their sick role. A six-step strategy for helping patients with functional somatic syndromes is presented here.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions or quantitative disorders of sexual drive are difficulties that an individual or a couple may experience at any stage of sexual activity as pain or difficulty in achieving sexual drive. Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

      "title": "Depression in the Elderly: The Unique Features Related to Diagnosis and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Depression affects 6.5 million of the 35 million Americans ≥65 years of age. While depression usually begins earlier in life and recurs periodically, it can present for the first time in people 80–90 years of age as well. Depression throughout the lifespan has a genetic/biological component but is also very much affected by social environmental factors. As people age, demographic factors, social support, and negative life events remain important to overall mental health, while physical illness and disability begin to take on a much more prominent role. Depression in the elderly is associated with impairment, dependency, disability, and significant distress for the individual and their family. This population is likely to present with concomitant cognitive dysfunction and medical illness, which can complicate the identification and treatment of psychiatric conditions. Bereavement is almost universal in late life and is sometimes a deterrent to appropriate diagnosis and treatment of depression. Physical frailty and diminishing social resources further complicate the treatment of depression in the elderly. Elderly individuals respond well to standard pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy treatments for depression. However, due to the high rate of relapse of depression in this population, continuous treatment is often warranted. This monograph will review depression in the elderly in the context of social disruptions, such as bereavement, caregiver strain, interpersonal conflict, role transitions, and social isolation; late-onset vascular depression and cognitive impairment; and physical illness including disability.",

      "abstract": "The various causes of tremor are considered by order of prevalence in the elderly. 1) Essential tremor occurs in 5% of the population beyond 65 years of age. It is characterized by a tremor accompanying muscle activity, and interesting, when complete, the two upper limbs, the head and the voice, with variable degree of severity. Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor. Terms which stigmatize, such as senile tremor, or terms which minimize the relational and social consequences of tremor, such as benign tremor, should be discarded.",

A disturbance may result from genetic/dispositional issues, from acute life events, from habitual behaviors and attitudes, or from any combination of these three types of issues. A number of treatment methods have been developed that use behavior modification and cognitive restructuring to facilitate homeostatic and circadian mechanisms of sleep, and to reduce arousal during bedtime.

      "title": "Disease activity and stress are linked in a subpopulation of chronic spontaneous urticaria patients",
      "abstract": "Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a condition characterized by the development of itchy wheals (hives), angioedema, or both, with reoccurring symptoms for more than 6 weeks. CSU is often fluctuating and unpredictable in its course,1 which is a great burden to the patients, especially when no underlying causes are found. Psychosomatic and psychiatric comorbidities are often reported and an association between CSU and stress was proposed, in which psychosocial strain may initiate a vicious cycle of stress-induced worsening of the disease causing a higher psychosocial burden, which in turn amplifies the stress influence on the disease.2-5 At present, systematic studies in support of a stress- and disease-relationship in CSU are largely missing, rendering the stress-contribution to CSU unclear. Comprehensive studies of the association between stress and urticaria are needed to answers to the following questions: Do CSU patients report relevant stress levels? Are stress levels higher when no underlying cause can be identified (CSU‒ CSU+ patients)? Do CSU‒ patients suffer from higher disease activity compared to CSU+ patients? And finally, are stress levels in CSU‒ and CSU+ patients linked to disease activity? To address these knowledge gaps, we studied stress perception and resilience and their association with disease severity, assessed by use of the urticaria activity score (UAS7) in an explorative manner. In addition, selected routinely assessed immune outcomes that have been discussed to play a role in stress effects in urticaria (IgE, basophils, eosinophils) were studied. The exploratory study was approved by ethics committee of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. A total of 303 CSU patients that provided informed written consent were assessed for mental distress, resilience, and immune outcomes (ELISA, complete blood count), and then, for potentially relevant underlying conditions, the results of which were disclosed to the patient after completion of the comprehensive workup of the etiologic tests by a team of experienced dermatologists (EMP, MM, MM). The scales \"worries,\" \"tension,\" \"and \"demands\" of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) were used to assess stress perception, \"joy\" and the Self-efficacy, Optimism and Pessimism (SWOP) questionnaire to assess resilience to stress.6, 7 PSQ \"summary score\" values above 50 are one SD (=17) higher, values below 16 are one SD lower than the mean (=33) in a German reference population,6 and were set as cutoffs for severe, medium and low stress, respectively. Additional data obtained included age, sex, body mass index, previous steroid- and anti-histamine intake. Investigated potentially relevant underlying clinical and laboratory conditions included autoreactivity, chronic viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, intolerance to food components, intolerance to physical provocation and chronic inflammatory diseases including autoimmune disorders and allergies. In 249 CSU patients, potentially relevant underlying conditions were identified (CSU+) as opposed to 54 patients without potentially relevant underlying conditions (CSU‒). Only a minority received oral medication prior to the assessment (antihistamines 20%, steroids 6%) and no medication or demographic differences were found between CSU+ and CSU‒ patients (Table S1). Levels of self-reported stress perception and resilience in CSU patients showed a wide range of mental distress levels, with low, moderate, and high PSQ scores in 21%, 64%, and 15% of patients, respectively. The mean PSQ \"summary score\" in women (32.05 ± 17.04, 72% of all patients) was slightly but not significantly higher than in men (29.82 ± 15.06). Patients younger than 45 years (55% of all patients) had slightly but not significantly higher PSQ \"summary score\" levels (33.12 ± 16.20) than older patients (29.55 ± 16.73). Chronic spontaneous urticaria‒ patients had significantly higher disease activity than CSU+ patients (Figure 1A). In CSU‒ patients, 52.6%, 31.6%, and 15.8% had UAS7 levels indicative of mild, moderate, and severe CSU, respectively, as compared to 64.2%, 25.8%, and 10% in CSU+ patients. CSU‒ patients reported higher PSQ \"worries,\" \"tension,\" and \"demands,\" with statistically increased values for the scale \"tension\" (Figure 1B,C, Table S2). In contrast, stress resilience in CSU‒ and CSU+ patients was similar. No group differences with respect to selected immunological measures such as total serum IgE, blood basophil and eosinophil counts were found (Table S3). Correlation analyses revealed that in CSU‒ patients, UAS7 scores showed a moderate positive correlation with the results of the PSQ-scales \"demands\" (r = .362; P = .028) and a trend for \"tension\" (r = .292; P = .0791) (Table 1). A regression analysis (including the confounders age, gender, and body mass index) confirmed these links in CSU‒ patients (adjusted R2 \"demands\" = 0.195; F(1/35) = 9.746; P = .004, Figure 1D; adjusted R2 \"tension\" = 0.082; F(1/35) = 4.218; P = .048, Figure 1E). The explained variance of 19.5% expresses a medium effect of f2 = 0.24 and of 8.2% a low effect of f2 = 0.09, respectively. By contrast, the common confounders age, gender, and body mass index were not significant predictors of the UAS7 in this group. Our comprehensive analyses of stress in patients with CSU are the first to demonstrate that most CSU patients report stress, but also that mean levels of mental distress are comparable to the general population.8 More importantly, our findings confirm that in CSU‒ perceived stress and disease activity are linked in the absence of demographic group differences and even before CSU‒ patients know that no underlying cause for their urticaria will be found. These observations are relevant and may help to destigmatize CSU patients, who often feel that their doctors and peers do not take their disease-burden seriously and attribute their suffering to the seemingly minor mental problem of having too much stress. In conclusion, our findings suggest a possible causal link between CSU and mental distress and encourage further research to confirm whether the increased levels of stress in the CSU‒ subpopulation are the reason or the result of their high disease levels. Clearly, in some CSU patients, the signs and symptoms of urticaria and stress are linked, which confirms the need to assess both the clinical symptoms and stress, ideally by daily diary-assessments and during patient visits, and also to address both by therapy and research, for example by the implementation of psychological interventions.

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "title": "La depresión: ¿un trastorno dimensional o categorial?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY One of the crucial subjects, either for the clinical or scientific activity, is the dimensional or categorical character of depression and other mental diseases. Each approach is different from the theoretical and epistemological points of view. At presence, the categorical model for the definition and estimation of the presence of a disorder are reflected in the data on epidemiology, the results of investigations, instruments and the interventions. These elements are related to a system of thinking which results in a particular form of conceiving the psychopathology and intervention. Nevertheless, the strong influence of the categorical model in which the disorders are defined as a group of accomplished criteria has not prevented from development of a dimensional model. The latter postulates the existence of a continuum between the normality and pathology which correspond with dimensions, levels and severity related to the certain behaviours, traits or even symptoms. The interest in the dimensional approach to psychopathology, in general and in mood disorders, is caused by the observation in clinics which indicate, for example, that many patients do not improve with medicines and present residual symptoms during long periods of time. For these reasons, some personality factors which would explain the chronic symptoms of disorders have been proposed in Psychology and Psychiatry. Although the diagnostic manuals consider different types of mood disorders, many investigations have showed the possibility to consider depression as a continuum, where the least severe extreme would be the depressive personality and the most severe, major depression. According to the abovementioned proposal, it is possible that some people present certain vulnerability which would explain the different answers in case of depression. Cognitive factors, together with social and genetic factors increase the risk of chronic depressive symptoms. The catastrophic perception of self, the world and future, the dichotomous thinking and tunnel vision are the cognitive factors associated with the presence of the mood disorders symptoms. Additionally, some studies show the importance of gender, as women are more prone to develop depression and similar disorders which is related to traditional social roles. This can be caused by the need to sacrifice the professional career to dedicate time to housework, or to assume multiple roles. Concerning the genetic factors, the presence of first degree relatives with mood disorders increases the risk of development of depression or dysthymia. The consideration of depressive personality is based on the presence of symptoms which do not fulfil the criteria of severity and frequency of major depression but do affect the mood. The presence of these stable traits is related to major chronicity and worse prognosis. This condition has been described in manuals as dysthymia. Nevertheless, as it remains relatively stable in time it could be understood as a personality disorder. The disorder would be a continuum with the normality similar to this described as neuroticism in which some entities are qualitatively and quantitatively different which represent the categories.",

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

      "title": "KNOWLEDGE REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS IN COMMUNITY AMONG THE ASHA WORKERS",
      "abstract": "Mental health' and 'mental illness' are increasingly being used as if they mean the same thing, but they do not. Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says, “There is no health without mental health.” In the course of a lifetime, not all people will experience a mental illness, but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental well-being (i.e., their mental health) just like we all have challenges with our physical well-being from time to time. Amental illness is an illness the affects that way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses, and they have different symptoms that impact peoples' lives in different ways. Just as it's possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness, it's entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness. That's because mental illnesses (like other health problems) are often episodic, meaning there are times ('episodes') of ill health and times of better or good health. With the right supports and tools, anyone can live well—however they dene well—and nd meaning, contribute to their communities, and work towards their goals. Objectives 1.To identify the knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness in community among the ASHAworkers in Kasaba Bawada, Kolhapur. Methodolgy: A non-experimental descriptive survey design was used for the study. Non probability purposive sampling technique was used to select 60 samples. Data collection was done using structured knowledge questionnaire. The data was analyzed by using descriptive (mean, S.D, Frequency and Percentage). The majority of the workers 40 (66.67%) belonged to the age group 31-40 years and minimum 08 (13.33%) workers belong to age group 41-50 years. The maximum of the workers 54 (90.00%) belonged to Hindu religion, and the remaining 6(10.00%) belonged to Muslim and Other religion. Maximum workers 56(93.34%) were married, and remaining 4 (6.66%) were widowed. Majority of the workers 28 (46.66%) studied till SSC and minimum 2 (3.34%) studied till graduation. Maximum 46 (76%) workers have poor knowledge and 13 (22%) have average knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness. Conclusion:The project work concludes that maximum workers have poor knowledge regarding mental health and mental illness, so there is need to focus on awareness of mental health among all the ASHAworkers.",

      "title": "Symptomkontrolle am Lebensende",
      "abstract": "Symptom Control at the End of Life Abstract. Patients with advanced disease suffer from multiple physical and psychological symptoms. These include pain, weakness, lack of energy, weight loss, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression. In the dying phase, death rattle, delirium and terminal agitation may be additional problems. Palliative care focusses on alleviating these symptoms, taking into account the physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimension. Main principles of symptom control in palliative care are 1) considering differential diagnoses of the causes of the symptom to be able to treat potentially reversible causes, 2) using preventive measures and 3) symptomatic treatment - on its own or in combination with causal therapy. The following should be noted regarding pharmacological treatment: In case of permanent symptoms, the drugs have to be given at fixed times, in accordance with their duration of action, to achieve a constant blood level. In addition to this regular drug administration, prn medication should be prescribed, e. g., for pain, breathlessness, and nausea. If oral administration is not possible, drugs can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or transdermally via patches. Non-pharmacological measures can be used additionally or primarily for symptom control. This paper presents important aspects of symptom control for pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression as well as for symptoms in the dying phase. It concludes by adding a few words on sedation in palliative care as a measure of last resort.Zusammenfassung. Patient_innen in fortgeschrittenen Krankheitsstadien leiden unter vielfältigen physischen und psychischen Beschwerden. Dazu gehören Schmerzen, Schwäche, Energielosigkeit, Gewichtsverlust, Atemnot, Übelkeit, Erbrechen, Verstopfung und Depression. In der Sterbephase können Rasselatmung, Delir und / oder terminale Unruhe hinzukommen. Der Fokus palliativmedizinischer Behandlung liegt auf der Linderung dieser belastenden Symptome unter Berücksichtigung der körperlichen, psychischen, sozialen und spirituellen Dimension. Zu den Grundsätzen der palliativmedizinischen Symptomkontrolle gehören 1) eine angemessene differentialdiagnostische Ursachenklärung des Symptoms zur Behandlung potenziell reversibler Ursachen, 2) der Einsatz von präventiven Massnahmen und 3) die Durchführung einer symptomatischen Therapie – allein oder parallel zu einer ursächlichen Therapie. Bezüglich der medikamentösen Therapiemassnahmen ist Folgendes zu beachten: Bei dauerhaft vorhandenen Symptomen müssen die Medikamente entsprechend ihrer Wirkdauer nach einem festen Zeitschema gegeben werden, um einen möglichst konstanten Wirkspiegel zu erreichen. Zusätzlich zu einer solchen Dauermedikation ist zum Beispiel für Schmerzen, Atemnot und Übelkeit Bedarfsmedikation zu verschreiben. Wenn die orale Gabe nicht möglich ist, können Medikamente intravenös, subkutan oder transdermal mittels Pflaster verabreicht werden. Nichtmedikamentöse Massnahmen können ergänzend oder auch primär zur Symptomlinderung eingesetzt werden. Dieser Beitrag stellt wichtige Aspekte der Symptomkontrolle bei Schmerzen, Atemnot, Übelkeit und Erbrechen, Obstipation, Depression sowie bei Symptomen in der Sterbephase vor und schliesst mit wenigen Worten zum Thema «Sedierung in der Palliativversorgung» als Ultima-Ratio-Massnahme.",

      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

Laboratory tests may be considered to assess for significant comorbidities, differential diagnoses, or contraindications to treatment. Management of MDD depends on its severity and may include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. The drugs most commonly used are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Treatment should be continued for at least 16 to 24 weeks to prevent recurrence. Referral to a psychiatrist or other mental health clinician should be considered when the diagnosis is in question or when symptoms do not improve with standard treatment.",

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

      "abstract": "#### The bottom line\n\nDelusional infestation (previously also known as delusional parasitosis or Ekbom’s syndrome) is a rare disorder, but it commonly poses disproportionate practical problems to healthcare systems.1 It is characterised by a patient’s fixed belief that his or her skin, body, or immediate environment is infested by small, living (or less often inanimate) pathogens despite the lack of any medical evidence for this.1 Delusional infestation is neither a single disease nor a single diagnostic entity. The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

Although emotional and psychiatric symptoms are prominent, psychiatric treatment is disappointing. PMS is simply a response to biochemical and metabolic changes following ovulation; distressing PMS represents a psychological maladjustment to these hormonal tides.",

Children with conduct disorders, with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have an elevated risk for antisocial or psychopathic personality disorders in adolescence and adulthood. The presence of comorbid disorders such as substance abuse and schizophrenia have a strong negative predictive value with respect to the course, the prognosis, and the outcome of antisocial and psychopathic disorders. Furthermore, there are substantial gender differences. The rates for spontaneous remission and improvement of antisocial and psychopathic personality disorders are possibly relatively high. In fact, these rates are higher for women than for men. In the fourth decade of life, most of the antisocial and psychopathic personalities are in remission.",

Depression, the most common mental disorder in later life, is a major precipitating factor in suicide. Alcoholism is another major precipitating factor in late-life suicide. Approximately one-third of all suicides are alcoholics. Many of the same factors which contribute to depression also increase the risk of alcoholism and/or suicide. Loss, stress, loneliness, low self-esteem, and feelings of anxiety, rejection, helplessness, and hopelessness characterize late life alcoholism and depression.

The pain can be constant or episodic and functionally disabling. Any dysfunction of the central nervous system can lead to central sensitization, which enhances and maintains pain as well as other symptoms that are mediated by the central nervous system. It occurs in subgroups of nearly every chronic pain condition and is characterized by multifocal pain and co-occurring somatic symptoms. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is defined as a condition in which having one or more somatic symptoms, such as excessive worries, pressure, and catastrophic events. These symptoms can be very disruptive to a patient’s life and can cause significant distress. SSD cases with severe symptoms frequently undergo repeated medical investigations and the symptoms often lead patients to seek emergency medical treatment and consult with specialists repeatedly, which is a source of frustration for patients and clinicians. Here we report a case that Asian female with persistent CPPS with comorbid SSD, who got in trouble for up to 8 years. This case reminds clinicians to pay excessive attention to the diagnosis of CPPS with comorbid SSD after recovery from acute COVID-19, with hope of raising awareness in the identification of SSD and present new insight into appropriate treatment for each woman who suffers from it.",

      "title": "Orosomucoid (<scp>ORM</scp>) as a Potential Biomarker for the Diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (<scp>CFS</scp>)",
      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterized by unexplained fatigue lasting at least 6 months that is not relieved by rest, which affects different body systems and results in cognitive problems, muscle pains, sleep problems, and so on. Physical or mental activity could worsen this illness. CFS is a widespread problem, and estimate for the prevalence of CFS varies widely from 0.007% to 2.8% 1. At present, diagnosis of CFS usually depends on subjective self-reported feeling and can be made only when other etiologies of fatigue have been excluded. For example, the commonly used criteria for diagnosing CFS include headache, pain in multiple joints or muscles, impaired memory, concentration, and sleep. However, these conditions are also frequently associated with other psychosocial factors, such as sleep disorder, depression, and anxiety 2, 3. Therefore, discovering associated characteristic biomarkers are essential for improving the diagnosis and treatment of CFS. Orosomucoid (ORM) is an acute phage protein which has many biological activities including modulating immunity, carrying drugs, maintaining the barrier function of capillary, mediating the sphingolipid metabolism, and also acting as an disease marker 4. In our previous study, we found that ORM was significantly upregulated in serum of various forms of fatigued rodents, especially dominantly in sleep-deprivation rats which have been used in the study of CFS 5, 6. To explore whether ORM could be utilized as a biomarker for CFS, we examined the serum level of ORM in 46 patients diagnosed with CFS according to CDC diagnosis criteria 7 and a group of 38 healthy volunteers. A significantly elevated level of ORM was found in sera from CFS patients (2.78 mg/mL) compared with that from healthy volunteers (0.44 mg/mL) (Figure 1A). The levels of ORM in sera from the volunteers are all lower than 1 mg/mL, whereas sera from 45 of the 46 CFS individuals contain ORM level higher than 1 mg/mL (Figure 1B). Glucocorticoids are known as a major regulator of ORM expression. However, the serum cortisol level in these CFS patients was moderately decreased (Figure 2),which is in accordance previous studies which reported mild hypocortisolism in CFS patients indicating clinically relevant hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction 8. These findings indicated that the ORM increase is not a direct result of stress response. Fatigue is a commonly experienced, but nonspecific and highly subjective symptom. Detecting and evaluating fatigue is a common task both in various society activities and in clinical practice. At present, there are still no specific factors that have been consistently associated with CFS, and there are no official or semi-official recommendations for the treatment of CFS 9. We found in this study that ORM is significantly elevated in sera from individuals with CFS. The ORM protein contains genetic polymorphisms. In human, there are two isoforms of ORM 4. Interestingly, it has been shown through proteomics analysis that increased ORM2 is a characteristic change in cerebrospinal fluid from patients diagnosed with CFS 10. These results suggest that it is worth to further explore whether ORM family protein could be used as a biomarker for CFS in the future.

The most common complaints of SD patients include recurrent pain (site and quality vary), conversion (pseudoneurologic) symptoms, nervousness or depression (or both), sexual and marital discord, and, often, menstrual difficulties. Such patients will generally have a history of repeated hospitalization or surgery. These symptoms are not perceived as mild or unimportant but lead to physician consultation, prescription drug use, and modification of life-style. Such patients are prone to \"doctor-shopping\" and self-medication and are at risk for many iatrogenic illnesses. Because they generally are resistant to psychologic explanations for their condition, management aimed at protecting them from the consequences of their behavior is important. A heightened threshold for instituting aggressive diagnostic and treatment procedures is necessary.",

      "title": "Therapeutic effectiveness and patient acceptance of a vestibular nerve activation intervention in chronic insomnia",
      "abstract": "Defined as: “Complaints of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep”, insomnia is one of the most common presenting symptoms in the primary care setting [1, 2]. The disturbance may consist of one or more of three features:• difficulty in initiating sleep• difficulty in maintaining sleep• waking up too early [3].Insomnia can have a serious impact on work performance and maintaining healthy social relationships [4]. Chronic insomnia is differentiated from acute insomnia by individuals experiencing at least one of the symptoms described above for a minimum of 30 days [3]. Predictably, there has been a wealth of research in the areas of assessment and treatment for this sleep disorder, given the impact insomnia has been shown to have on mental and physical health and wellbeing [3-5]. Incidence rates are routinely around 9% of the general population, escalating to 30% for those who report occasional suffering [6]. Many individuals continue to report symptoms of insomnia for many years after initial onset [7]. Areas of particular interest to clinicians, health-care professionals and insomnia sufferers include implementation, acceptance and adherence to therapies that provide effective long-term management. Conventional treatments include prescription medications (sedative-hypnotics), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other alternative therapies (e.g. alcohol, herbal remedies and off-label use of other medicines) [3]. While sedative-hypnotics and CBT have been shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia [3,8], expert opinion counsels against long-term use of sedative-hypnotics due to residual sedation, rebound insomnia, memory impairment, dependency and withdrawal difficulties [9, 10]. In addition, CBT is not easily accessed and patients frequently have difficulty adhering to the strict behavioral program that is typically prescribed [11]. A further area of concern is the limited evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of alternative therapies, despite their widespread use [3].One promising approach to managing chronic insomnia is non-invasive mechanical vestibular nerve stimulation, which has been demonstrated to affect sleep [12-17]. The vestibular apparatus, in conjunction with visual and proprioceptive inputs, is responsible for maintaining balance under all conditions. Previous studies have used a mechanical rocking motion to induce vestibular activation, mimicking the sensation of infants being comforted by their parents. Improvements in sleep architecture and increased Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency, Rapid Eye Movement and decreased Sleep Onset Latency have been demonstrated when using this technique [12-17]. A unique therapy, designed to non-invasively stimulate the vestibular nerve to promote sleep onset, has recently been developed. As an alternative to the rocking motion delivered by mechanical action, a swaying sensation is artificially created through mild electrical stimulation. Clinical studies have been previously conducted to investigate both the safety and efficacy of this medical device for the treatment of insomnia via a transient insomnia model, with positive outcomes [18, 19]. Individuals with chronic insomnia report similar issues in sleep disturbance to those in transient insomnia, but persistent in nature. Given the limitations of current effective therapies, and the recent emphasis on patient-centered care [20], there is an increasing need for an alternative treatment for insomnia symptoms. It has been shown that patient preference for non-pharmacological treatment was over three times greater than prescription medications [21]. Thus many would prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach if an effective one were available [11]. Vestibular nerve activation may provide such a treatment for chronic insomnia.",

More or less extreme outbursts of emotion such as anger or inappropriate laughter are commonly understood as due to 'stress'.

      "title": "Case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency mimicking major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder. The patient gave the authors informed consent to publish this letter.",

      "title": "Understanding subthreshold depression.",
      "abstract": "The concept of subsyndromal, subthreshold or sub-case depression has received considerable attention in recent decades. Judd and colleagues[1] — who reported that patients with depression are symptomatic more than 60% of the time and that most of that time is spent in subthreshold states— proposed the following operational definition of subsyndromal depression: ‘two or more simultaneous symptoms of depression, present for most or all of the time, at least 2 weeks in duration, associated with evidence of social dysfunction, occurring in individuals who do not meet criteria for diagnoses of minor depression, major depression, and/or dysthymia.’\r\n\r\nDistinguishing major depressive disorder from subthreshold depression and distinguishing the different types of subthreshold depression from each other is one example of a fundamental limitation of our current psychiatric nosology. The elaborate classification systems currently in use in psychiatry are based on subjective descriptions of symptoms. The detailed phenomenology includes descriptions of multiple overlapping clinical subtypes, but there are no biological characteristics that distinguish one subtype from another. Moreover, different disorders can exhibit similar clinical symptoms and the same disorder can have different symptomatic patterns in different individuals.[2] In the absence of biological markers, establishing thresholds in terms of frequency, duration or severity of symptoms that define when a symptom cluster becomes ‘psychopathological’ and that distinguish one symptom cluster from another symptom cluster will always be problematic.\r\n\r\nThe original hope for ICD-10 and DSM-IV was that the diagnostic emphasis on observable behaviors (rather than on presumed cognitions) would advance the reliability and validity of the diagnostic categories. Based on this approach, the core entity of depressive disorders in DSM-IV became a uniform major depressive disorder with modifiers for different subtypes (e.g., psychotic or atypical) and for circumstances presumed to have clinical significance (e.g., seasonal or postpartum depression).[3]–[5] The authors of ICD-10 recognized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of affective disorders but did not feel that the related science was sufficiently mature: ‘the relationship between etiology, symptoms, underlying biochemical processes, response to treatment, and outcome of mood [affective] disorders is not yet sufficiently well understood to allow their classification in a way that is likely to meet with universal approval’.[5],[9] The reported emphasis of the upcoming DSM-5 on the dimensional aspects of psychopathology may provide an opportunity to more clearly characterize the different manifestations of the different subthreshold conditions along the depressive continuum, but this remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that the depressive symptoms at the major, minor, dysthymic or subsyndromal levels are all integral components of the longitudinal clinical structure of major depressive disorder (MDD), with each symptom level representing a different phase of illness intensity, activity and severity.[1],[2],[6],[7] The different depressive disorders included in official diagnostic systems (i.e., MDD, minor depression, dysthymia) and subsyndromal depression do not represent discrete disorders but, rather, are stages along a dimensional continuum of symptomatic severity.\r\n\r\nOvercoming the current nosological problems will require changing the current phenomenology-based classification system to a classification system based on reliable neurobiological findings that takes into consideration the remarkable synchronization of psychological, social and cultural factors with biochemistry and physiology.[3],[4] Studies of the relationship of stress and illness[2],[4] that clarify the inter-related roles of social, psychological and biological factors in the cause, course and outcomes of mental disorders provide one clear example of the potential benefits of this more integrative approach to the conceptualization of mental disorders.\r\n\r\nIt is now broadly accepted that psychological stress may change the internal homeostatic state of an individual. During acute stress adaptive physiological responses occur, including the increased adrenocortical secretion of hormones, primarily cortisol.[2]–[4] Several authors hypothesize that prolonged dysfunction of the stress response system, characterized by either hyper- or hypo-activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, plays a central role in the etiology and course of mood disorders. There is accumulating evidence supporting the suggestion that depressive disorders include individuals with different treatment response profiles who have abnormalities in HPA axis activity and in immune functions.[3]–[5],[8],[9]\r\n\r\nDespite the fluctuating operational criteria and the current lack of definitive biomarkers for subthreshold depressive states, it is clear that the various subthreshold depressive conditions have a high prevalence in the community and are all associated with psychosocial disability, poor quality of life, and high healthcare costs that increase incrementally in parallel with increases in symptom severity.[1],[6],[7] Moreover, individuals with any of the subtypes of subthreshold depression are more likely to experience full-criteria episodes of MDD and to progress into a persistent, fluctuating depressive condition. Thus, research advances in understanding the neurobiology of subthreshold depression and the related development of evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for these conditions could substantially decrease the morbidity associated with subthreshold depressive symptoms that, in spite of their high prevalence and impact, are often overlooked, underdiagnosed, and undertreated.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

Cet etat est une caracteristique commune a l'exposition a l'altitude et au syndrome d'apnees obstructives du sommeil (SAOS), bien que celle-ci soit continue dans le premier cas et intermittente et nocturne dans le second.L'hypoxie d'altitude entraine une alteration des performances cognitives et motrices. La reduction de la performance a l'exercice en altitude a longtemps ete attribuee a une alteration du metabolisme musculaire du fait d'une reduction de l'apport en oxygene. Les perturbations cerebrales induites par l'hypoxie pourraient egalement avoir un role majeur dans cette limitation.Le SAOS, veritable enjeu de sante publique, est associe a des troubles cognitifs pouvant ainsi influencer le fonctionnement quotidien des patients souffrant de ce syndrome et resulter en une somnolence diurne excessive, une baisse de la qualite de vie ou encore une reduction de la productivite au travail et des performances scolaires. Le fait que ces alterations cerebrales puissent influencer les capacites motrices et a l'effort des patients atteints d’apnees obstructives du sommeil reste en revanche a investiguer.Au cours de ce travail de these, nous nous sommes interesses a deux modeles d’exposition hypoxique et a leurs consequences cerebrales et neuromusculaires. Nous avons tout d’abord etudie l'effet d'une exposition a l'hypoxie d'altitude aigue (quelques heures) et prolongee (plusieurs jours) sur la fonction neuromusculaire et ses repercussions a l'exercice chez le sujet sain. Nous avons ensuite etudie l'influence du modele d'hypoxie intermittente associe au SAOS sur la fonction neuromusculaire et la tolerance a l'exercice de ces patients. Nous avons ainsi cherche a caracteriser les alterations cerebrales a l'exercice en lien avec ce syndrome et leur reversibilite suite a un traitement en ventilation par pression positive continue.Chez le sujet sain, nous avons demontre que la performance a l'exercice impliquant une masse musculaire reduite (flechisseurs du coude) n'etait pas limitee par une fatigue centrale accrue apres 1 et 5 jours d'exposition a une altitude de 4350 m. Nous avons mis en evidence que la dysfonction musculaire (force et endurance reduites) observee chez le patient SAOS est associee a un deficit d'activation supraspinal et une augmentation de l'inhibition intracorticale. De plus, nos resultats suggerent qu'une alteration de la reponse cerebrovasculaire a l'exercice puissent impacter negativement la tolerance a l'exercice des patients souffrant d'un SAOS severe. Ces alterations neuromusculaires et cerebrovasculaires n'etaient pas corrigees apres un traitement de huit semaines par ventilation nocturne en pression positive continue soulignant la nature persistante de ces alterations cerebrales.",

Assessment of chronic pain and somatization is essential because it may be a means for the patient to communicate psychological distress, arising out of stress and conflicts within the environment. Sociocultural factors have an important role in the manifestations, help-seeking, and management of these chronic pain and somatizing syndromes. Some specific pain syndromes and somatizing syndromes are seen in India, including that syndrome, sinking heart syndrome, and a variety of somatic neuroses.

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

      "title": "Neurobiological bases for impulsive and compulsive behaviour: Implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions",
      "abstract": "Pathological impulsivity and/or compulsivity charcterize a wide range of mental disorders, including impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, substance use disorder and behavioural addictions. Impulsivity is a complex, multidimensional personality trait which consists of at least two dimensions: disinhibition (impulsive actions) and impulsive decision-making or impulsive choice, with an underestimation of potentially dangerous consequences (e.g., aggression, pathological gambling, hypersexuality). Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive decline is associated with poor physical health, particularly cardiovascular disease and diabetes, as well as depression and low socioeconomic status. Depression is known to be associated with increased levels of cognitive decline, but there is also growing evidence that psychological wellbeing is predictive of better general health. It has been shown, for instance, that stroke is less common in those with a positive sense of wellbeing. Optimistic older people have also been found to have lower rates of both mortality and institutionalisation over a ten-year period. This may be because of reduced levels of stress. There is evidence to suggest that positive mood influences cognitive performance over short periods and it is also possible that high levels of psychological wellbeing are beneficial for cognitive function over longer time periods.",

      "title": "Vulnerabilidad cognitiva a la hipocondría: intrusiones, valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales/ cognitive vulnerability to hypochondriasis: intrusions, appraisals and dysfunctional beliefs",
      "abstract": "Hypochondriasis is a disorder characterized by the fear or belief of suffering from a serious illness based on the negative interpretation of bodily signs and symptoms. After a thorough evaluation, confirmation by a physician that the patient does not have a medical condition does not result in safe and lasting reassurance. Generally, people with hypochondriasis may experience a reduction in anxiety after a visit to the doctor, but this reduction lasts only hours or days. When another symptom occurs, anxiety reappears, and the cycle of hypochondriacal worry resumes. In addition, hypochondriasis can manifest itself in different ways. Some patients have numerous intrusive thoughts and sensations during the day that lead them to consult family, friends, the Internet, or different medical specialists to make sure they are not seriously ill or to identify the course of the disease. Other patients, on the other hand, avoid health care providers and any reference to the disease in their daily lives, so that the anxiety they seek to suppress does not increase. Hypochondriasis has also been conceptualized in cognitive models as an extreme form of health anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral proposals of hypochondriasis and health anxiety and recent research on this disorder have suggested different cognitive variables as possible risk factors for the development and maintenance of the problem. They include intrusive thoughts about possible health hazards (illness-ITs), the dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs associated with these thoughts, and dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness. Although these variables have been pointed out in the literature as vulnerability factors for hypochondriasis and health anxiety, there are hardly any studies analyzing their role in the genesis and development of the disorder, and the results obtained are not entirely conclusive either. The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the role played by these variables in hypochondriasis and health anxiety. The preliminary study provided a reliable and valid instrument to evaluate health anxiety in Spanish-speaking adults, the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). Study 1 explored the presence and characteristics of illness-ITs in the general population, and through this study, a new self-report instrument has been provided, the Illness Intrusive Thoughts Inventory (INPIE), to evaluate illness-ITs. Study 2 examined differences between patients with hypochondriasis and community participants in the recurrence of illness-ITs and the consequences of experiencing them. Studies 2 and 3 also evaluated the role of dysfunctional appraisals and beliefs about illness-ITs. Study 4 analyzed the importance of the family context in the adoption of dysfunctional beliefs about health/illness and thoughts. The results show that (1) the SHAI is an appropriate self-report instrument to measure health anxiety in the Spanish-speaking adult population; (2) the INPIE is an adequate self-report questionnaire to assess the frequency of illness-ITs, as well as the appraisals and control strategies associated with these thoughts; (3) illness-ITs are a universal and dimensional phenomenon; (4) dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs about illness-ITs play a significant role in the escalation from normal intrusive cognitions and their associated consequences to clinical health anxiety-related symptoms; and (5) dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness and thoughts can be acquired within the family. These results have substantial clinical implications because understanding the functioning and characteristics of some of the key elements in the genesis and development of hypochondriasis and health anxiety may improve and update the treatment protocols for these patients. La hipocondria es un trastorno caracterizado por el miedo o la creencia de padecer una enfermedad grave a partir de la interpretacion negativa de los signos y sintomas corporales. La confirmacion por parte de un medico, despues de una evaluacion exhaustiva, de que el paciente no padece una enfermedad medica, no tiene como resultado una tranquilizacion segura y duradera. Por lo general, las personas que presentan hipocondria pueden experimentar una reduccion de la ansiedad despues de visitar al medico, pero esta reduccion dura solo horas o dias. Cuando se presenta otro sintoma, la ansiedad reaparece y el ciclo de preocupacion hipocondriaca se reanuda. Ademas, la hipocondria se puede manifestar de diferentes maneras. Algunos pacientes tienen numerosos pensamientos intrusos y sensaciones durante el dia que los llevan a consultar con la familia, amigos, internet o diferentes especialistas medicos para asegurarse de que no estan gravemente enfermos o para identificar el curso de la enfermedad. Y, otros pacientes, por el contrario, evitan a los proveedores de servicios de salud y cualquier referencia a la enfermedad en su vida diaria, para que no aumente la ansiedad que buscan reprimir. La hipocondria se ha conceptualizado tambien, desde los modelos cognitivos, como la forma mas extrema de ansiedad por la salud. Las propuestas cognitivo-conductuales de la hipocondria y las investigaciones recientes en torno a este trastorno han sugerido diferentes variables cognitivas como posibles factores de riesgo para el desarrollo y mantenimiento del problema. Entre ellos, destacan: los pensamientos intrusos sobre los posibles peligros para la salud (PIEs), las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a estos pensamientos, y los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad. Aunque todas estas variables se han senalado, en la literatura cientifica, como factores de vulnerabilidad hacia la hipocondria, no existen apenas estudios en los que se analice su papel en la genesis y evolucion del trastorno, y los resultados obtenidos tampoco son del todo concluyentes. Por todo ello, la presente Tesis tiene como finalidad clarificar el rol que juegan los pensamientos intrusos, las valoraciones/interpretaciones y las creencias disfuncionales (sobre los pensamientos y sobre la salud/enfermedad) en la hipocondria y la ansiedad por la salud. El estudio preliminar proporciono un instrumento fiable y valido para evaluar la ansiedad por la salud en adultos de habla hispana, el Inventario Breve de Ansiedad por la Salud (SHAI). El Estudio 1 exploro la presencia y caracteristicas de los PIEs en la poblacion general, y a traves de este estudio se ha proporcionado un nuevo instrumento de autoinforme, el Inventario de Pensamientos Intrusos sobre la Enfermedad (INPIE), para evaluar los PIEs. El estudio 2 examino las diferencias entre los pacientes con hipocondria y los participantes de la comunidad en la recurrencia con la que se experimentaban PIEs y las consecuencias derivadas de su experimentacion. Los estudios 2 y 3 tambien evaluaron el papel de las valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs. El estudio 4 analizo la importancia del contexto familiar en la adopcion de supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos. Los resultados muestran que (1) el SHAI es un instrumento de autoinforme apropiado para medir la ansiedad por la salud en la poblacion adulta de habla hispana; (2) el INPIE es un cuestionario de autoinforme adecuado para evaluar la frecuencia de los PIEs, asi como las valoraciones y estrategias de control asociadas a estos pensamientos; (3) los PIEs son un fenomeno universal y dimensional; (4) las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs juegan un papel significativo en la escalada de los pensamientos intrusos normales y sus consecuencias funcionales a los sintomas clinicos relacionados con la ansiedad por la salud, y (5) los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos pueden adquirirse en el seno familiar. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones clinicas sustanciales, ya que la comprension del funcionamiento y las caracteristicas de algunos de los elementos clave para la genesis y el desarrollo de la hipocondria y la ansiedad para la salud puede mejorar y actualizar los protocolos de tratamiento para estos pacientes.",

      "title": "A review on pain and its signals modulation by body",
      "abstract": "Pain is an uncomfortable feeling that tells you something may be wrong. It can be steady, throbbing, stabbing, aching, pinching, or described in many other ways. Sometimes, it’s just a nuisance, like a mild headache. Other times it can be debilitating. Pain can bring about other physical symptoms, like nausea, dizziness, weakness or drowsiness. It can cause emotional effects like anger, depression, mood swings or irritability. Pain can change your lifestyle and impact your job, relationships and independence. Pain is classified as either acute or chronic. Acute pain is usually severe and short-lived, and is often a signal that your body has been injured. Chronic pain can range from mild to severe, is present for long periods of time, and is often the result of a disease that may require ongoing treatment. When we sense pain, we pay attention to our bodies and can take steps to fix what hurts. Pain also may prevent us from injuring a body part even more. If it didn't hurt to walk on a broken leg, a person might keep using it and cause more damage. If your throat is really sore, you'll probably go to the doctor, who can treat the infection if you have one. Pain itself often modifies the way the central nervous system processes pain, so that a patient actually becomes more sensitive and gets more pain with less provocation. This is called “central sensitization.” (And there’s peripheral sensitization too.) Sensitized patients are not only more sensitive to things that should hurt, but also to ordinary touch and pressure as well. Their pain also “echoes,” fading more slowly than in other people. This phenomenon is usually superimposed over other problems, but it can also occur acutely and be the primary issue, as in complex regional pain syndrome, or amplified pain syndrome, which disporportionately affects everyone.

      "abstract": "There has long been recognition of the enormous and persistent personal and social consequences of mental illness. The chronicity of disorders such as schizophrenia and dementia, and the long-term if lower-level debilitation of depression and many neuroses, have substantial impacts on cognition, health, functioning and quality of life. They can leave many sufferers and their families with constrained, deprived, often devastated lives. The care of people with mental health problems in hospital or in community settings, support for their families and the treatment of symptoms as well as clinical and social sequelae generate considerable costs for health care, social services and other agencies. Directly or indirectly, there are also cost burdens for sufferers and their families. The consequences of mental illness, in other words, can be far-reaching and expensive.",

Prominent features are the late onset of these symptoms, several days after treatment has been discontinued, and the sometimes difficult diagnosis, since patients are usually unaware of their dependence on these drugs. Reinstituting benzodiazepine treatment, then withdrawing it progressively are the best curative measures.

      "title": "Management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: The role of mood stabilizers",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are associated with symptoms that extend far beyond cognitive deficits. The most distressing of these symptoms are known as the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and include delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggression, misidentification, and sexually inappropriate behaviors. As a result of BPSD, AD patients suffer a poorer quality of life, as do their caregivers.1 Behavioral and psychological symptoms can be so distressing to the caregiver that they are a common reason for families placing their loved ones in long-term care. Approximately 60% and 80% of dementia patients living in the community and in long-term care settings develop BPSD, respectively.1Aggression and agitation are characterized by increased or disruptive psychomotor activity, inappropriate verbal activity, or disorganized motor activity that is not explained by the patient's needs. Often times, dementia patients present with aggression and agitation as well as psychotic symptoms. Atypical antipsychotics have been the most widely studied agents for the management of psychotic symptoms as well as aggression and agitation.1 Despite their noted efficacy for BPSD, their use has been curtailed over recent years due to concerns about an increase in cerebrovascular events and increased mortality with their use. This has led to an ongoing search for other effective pharmacologic treatments for BPSD. Several mood stabilizers including valproic acid, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate have been studied in dementia patients. This paper aims to present the data on the efficacy of mood stabilizing drugs for the management of BPSD.In 2007, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) developed a white paper on the use of antipsychotics in elderly people with dementia for the purpose of treating psychosis and agitation.1 This paper also reviewed the use of numerous other psychotropic drugs in this population. Evidence for atypical antipsychotic efficacy in psychosis of dementia indicated that these agents have modest efficacy. The data are difficult to interpret because these studies often included patients with psychosis and agitation. To further complicate the studies, the primary outcome was often a measure of global psychiatric symptoms, not a rating scale to assess psychosis or agitation only. There have been very few studies evaluating the use of atypical antipsychotics for agitation only. This is partly due to the fact it is difficult to recruit dementia patients with agitation only since it frequently overlaps with psychosis. Agents such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole have reportedly shown some benefit for agitation in dementia patients.Nearly 10 years ago, the FDA issued a warning regarding cerebrovascular events (CVEs) such as strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) associated with the use of risperidone. Soon after, the FDA evaluated CVE's with other atypical antipsychotics and the warning was added to olanzapine and aripiprazole. Furthermore, an analysis of pooled data indicated that the rates of CVEs were 1.9% for patients receiving atypical antipsychotics and 0.9% for placebo-treated patients (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–2.8). Of course there are limitations to these data, most notably of which is that these studies were not powered to evaluate the relationship between drug and adverse events; they were powered to evaluate efficacy. In addition, the definition of CVE is not defined in the studies, nor were these events validated. Lastly, there is likely no difference in the rates of CVEs between typical and atypical agents.In addition to the risk of CVEs, increased mortality rates in the elderly have been reported with atypical antipsychotics. These data led the FDA to issue a black box warning for antipsychotics in the elderly regarding the higher mortality rates, which were mostly due to cardiac or infectious disease. A meta-analysis reported that the elderly mortality rate was 3.5% with atypical agents compared to 2.3% with placebo. Again, there were numerous limitations cited including limited data regarding the circumstances around the deaths as well as controversy surrounding the mortality risk in patients receiving typical antipsychotics.The study known as the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness for Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD) evaluated the use of antipsychotics in elderly dementia patients under naturalistic conditions.2 Patients were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or placebo. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of treatment for any reason as well as minimal improvement as noted on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 12 weeks. Patients reportedly discontinued quetiapine due to lack of efficacy after a mean of only 9.1 weeks compared to olanzapine and risperidone where patients continued treatment for a mean of 22.1 and 26.7 weeks, respectively. Patients discontinued all treatments earlier than placebo due to adverse events.In addition to reporting the efficacy of antipsychotics in dementia patients with psychosis and agitation, the ACNP white paper also reported on the use of other psychotropic drugs for these symptoms.1 There were three trials that evaluated the efficacy of VPA for agitation or aggression in dementia patients.3–5 Two of the studies were completed in patients with agitation and one with patients with aggression. All three studies failed to show any benefit of VPA over placebo for management of aggression or agitation. Additionally, two trials evaluated the short-term (6 week) use of carbamazepine (CBZ) for agitation. Both CBZ trials were small (n of 51 and 21), and reported mixed results. Total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores indicated that CBZ was more effective than placebo in one study7 but no difference was found in the other.6 Olin and colleagues actually reported that there was a significant improvement on the hostility item of the BPRS but a worsening of the hallucination item in CBZ-treated patients.6 The authors also reported that their study lacked statistical power and that they would have needed 69 patients in order to confirm the findings regarding the total BPRS scores.6Unfortunately, the long-term use of CBZ is limited by its poor tolerability, including ataxia and disorientation, and the risk of significant drug-drug interactions.Since the publication of the ACNP white paper, there has been one further study that evaluated the efficacy of VPA in agitation and aggression.8 This study included patients with moderate to severe AD and were experiencing agitation or aggression based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scores (NPI). Patients had to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV)9 criteria for AD, have a mini-mental status exam (MMSE) score of < 15, and an NPI > 8. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Each treatment period was 6 weeks with a 2 week wash-out period. Forty patients were referred, but consent was obtained from only 16. Two patients dropped out prior to enrollment, leaving 14 in the study (8M, 6F). Prior to starting the study, patients underwent a wash-out of current psychotropic medications for a period equal to 5 half-lives of the drugs. Treatment was initiated with VPA 125 mg twice per day for one week and increased to 500 mg twice per day during week two. The dose was increased according to symptom response and patient tolerability to a maximum of 1,500 mg per day. The dose could be decreased, as needed. Loxapine 2.5 mg up to 4 doses per week was permitted as a rescue medication. The primary outcome was the NPI agitation score. Secondary measures were the NPI total score and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Primary and secondary outcomes were measured using the Wilcoxon signed ranks tests comparing the change in scores for VPA vs. placebo.The results indicated that the NPI agitation scores decreased for VPA-treated patients and increased for placebo-treated patients (1.43+/−3.87 vs-2.08 +/−4.05, p=0.043). The change in scores for the VPA group represents a worsening of symptoms. Worsening of symptoms was also seen on the total NPI and CMAI scores, but was significant only for the CMAI (NPI p=0.075 and CMAI p=0.039). Twelve VPA patients had adverse effects such as falls (5), sedation (4), thrombocytopenia (2), and loose stools (2). The placebo group had 2 patients with sedation and 1 fall. The conclusion is that VPA was ineffective for agitation and aggression and was poorly tolerated in elderly AD patients.A second study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of VPA for preventing agitation and aggression in AD patients.10 Patients had to meet criteria for possible or probable AD by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke AND the Alzheimer's Diseaseand Related Disorders Association criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA), have a MMSE of 12–20, and be free from agitation or psychosis as defined by NPI < 1 on items assessing delusions, hallucinations, or agitation. This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm flexible-dose study. Patients received VPA for two years in a double-blind fashion, and then had a two-month, single-blind placebo treatment period. The VPA target dose was 10–12 mg/kg and used identical appearing VPA and placebo tablets. The primary outcome was defined as the development of a score of at least 3 on one or more NPI items assessing delusions, hallucinations, and agitation for 2 weeks. Other scales used to assess secondary outcomes included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), CMAI, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living (ADCS-Activities of Daily Living), the Quality of Life-AD, and the ADCS Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). The primary endpoint was evaluated using the cox proportional hazards model comparing time to end point in the drug and placebo groups and adjusted for variables such as age, sex, baseline MMSE, total NPI, total CMAI, and ADCS-Activities of Daily Living. All assessments were completed at baseline, and every three months until the 24th month, then at month 26. Five hundred thirteen patients were screened and 313 were randomized. At enrollment, the mean MMSE in both groups was 16.9 and the NPI subscales for agitation, delusions, and hallucinations were < 1.0. The mean modal dose of VPA was 250 mg/day and the mean VPA level at 12 months was 42.7 mcg/ml. Sixty-one percent of VPA and 62% of placebo patients discontinued treatment early. The time to the primary endpoint did not differ between the two groups (p=0.88). Twenty-nine placebo and 25 VPA patients reached the endpoint. The mean change in ADAS-cog scores indicated that there were some differences that favored placebo (VPA 9.4, PLC 6.8, p=0.01). The ADCS Activities of Daily Living scores at 18 months also favored placebo (VPA-19.3, PLC-14.4, p=0.02). More VPA than placebo-treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (16% vs 7.5%). This study failed to show any benefit of VPA in preventing the development of agitation, delusions, or hallucinations.Due to the intolerability and drug interactions noted in carbamazepine trials as well as the lack of efficacy reported with VPA, other mood stabilizers have been evaluated for controlling BPSD. Topiramate (TOP) is a viable option secondary to its reported efficacy in controlling irritability and aggression in other psychiatric populations.11 However, there is concern with the use of TOP in the dementia population due to cognitive decline reported with its use.To date, there is only one published, prospective trial of TOP for aggression in dementia patients.12 This was an 8-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, comparing topiramate to risperidone (RIS) that included 48 patients with mild to moderate severity of AD defined by an MMSE score of 10–26. Patients were included if they had a complaint of behavioral disturbances and had an NPI score of greater than 1 in sub-items relating to delusions; hallucinations; agitation and aggression; and irritability and lability. Topiramate was initiated at 25 mg/day and increased to 50 mg/day after 2 weeks. Risperidone was initiated at 0.25 mg/day with a doubling in dose every week until target dose of 2 mg/day was achieved. In both groups, the dose could be reduced if adverse events occurred. The mean daily dose of TOP was 44.0 mg and RIS was 1.9 mg. Any improvement on NPI parts 1 and 2 or the CMAI were considered the primary outcomes. Part 1 of the NPI assesses behavioral disturbances and affective and psychotic symptoms; part 2 assesses caregiver burden and distress. Cognitive function was assessed with the MMSE.Forty eight patients were enrolled, but 41 completed the trial. Seven patients dropped out due to adverse events; fatigue and loss of appetite were reported in the TOP group and GI disturbance and akathisia in the RIS group. Both groups showed improvements in the NPI parts 1 and 2 from baseline to week 8. However, no statistically significant differences were seen between groups (NPI part I: P<0.575, NPI part 2: P<0.456). Both groups also showed a decrease in agitation as assessed by CMAI scores but no statistically significant difference noted (P<0.927). Cognitive status on the MMSE was not found to change significantly in either group (P<0.479). In conclusion, the authors found that low dose TOP had comparable efficacy to RIS in treating behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's dementia. However, nearly 15% failed to complete the study due to adverse events.Carbamazepine has shown efficacy in treating BPSD, but carries a high risk for adverse events and drug-drug interactions.1 Oxcarbazepine(OXC) has been hypothesized to be efficacious as it has a similar structure to carbamazepine, but with better tolerability. There are case reports suggesting that oxcarbazepine may be beneficial in treating BPSD. To formally evaluate the efficacy of OXC for BPSD, an 8 week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo control trial for the treatment of agitation and aggression in patients with a diagnosis of AD, vascular dementia, or mixed dementia was conducted.13 This study included patients with moderate to severe dementia as defined by a MMSE of 0–20, a history of agitation or aggression for at least 1 week, a score of 6 or greater on Neurospychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) subscale for agitation and aggression, and were in a nursing home for at least 4 weeks. Patients who were receiving psychotropic medications prior to the study could not have dose changes within 2 weeks before and throughout the study. New psychotropic agents could not be initiated during the study except for haloperidol if needed as a rescue medication. Patients were randomly assigned to receive OXC 300–900 mg/day or placebo. Oxcarbazepine was initiated at 75 mg in the morning and 225 mg in the evening with dose increases up to a total of 900 mg/day after 3 weeks with the highest, well-tolerated dose maintained. The mean daily dose of OXC was 536.6 mg/day. The primary outcome was the change in the agitation and aggression subscore of NPI-NH. Secondary outcomes included change in agitation measured by the Brief Agitation Rating Scale (BARS) and change in burden of care measured by NPI-NH.A total of 103 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication with 83 patients completing the study. No significant difference was found between groups for any of the outcomes assessed regardless of whether the intention to treat or per protocol population analysis was used (NPI-NH agitation and aggression subscore P=0.70, BARS P=0.07, NPI-NH P=0.58). Interestingly, there was also no significant difference between groups in the use of haloperidol (P=0.26). The most common side effects occurring in the active treatment group included urinary tract infections, falls, a decrease in serum sodium, ataxia, fainting, and sedation. In conclusion, the study failed to show any benefit of OXC for the management of agitation or aggression in patients with moderate to severe dementia.There have been some smaller, open studies and case studies published on this topic involving other mood stabilizers not already mentioned in this review. A recent case series showed benefit with low dose gabapentin 200–600 mg/day in treating aggressive behavior in seven patients with the vascular or mixed dementia.14 Gabapentin was well tolerated and produced sustained results at follow up varying from 2–6 months.14Lamotrigine has shown to be effective and well-tolerated over six months in a case report of a patient diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia who was demonstrating verbal and physical aggression.15 Another case series of five patients with dementia, manic-like symptoms, and agitation treated with lamotrigine reported improvements on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) after five months of treatment.16 None of the patients had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events.Two small, open-label trials with less than 20 patients each reported the effectiveness of levetiracetam for the management of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Both trials found significant improvement from baseline in the NPI and YMRS.17,18 One report indicated that three patients required a dose reduction of levetiracetam as two patients experienced lethargy and one had an increase in agitation.17 The second study noted that no patient had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events, but did not mention if any dose reductions were required.18Since the publication of the ACNP White Paper in 2007, there have only been three randomized clinical trials studying mood stabilizers for treatment of BPSD. Low-dose TOP and RIS were reported to be equally effective for BPSD. Prospective, placebo-controlled trials of OXC and VPA failed to show any benefit in patients with BPSD. Open trials and case studies have shown some limited effectiveness for gabapentin, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam and require further evaluation in a controlled setting.Due to a paucity of data indicating efficacy and safety, no mood stabilizer is currently FDA approved for the management of BPSD. If a mood stabilizer is indicated for patients with dementia showing aggressive or agitated behavior, their use should only be considered in cases where the symptoms pose serious risk to the patient or their caregivers. Antipsychotics have the most data indicating some moderate efficacy for BPSD, but their use is associated with serious adverse events, like CVEs, and an increased mortality in the elderly. Carbamazepine also has reported mixed efficacy but is associated with poor tolerability and a risk of drug-drug interactions. Gabapentin, lamotrigine and levetiracetam may hold promise, but further research using placebo controlled trials are needed before recommendations can be made with these agents. Overall, no single pharmacologic agent has shown efficacy and tolerability in the elderly patient with BPSD. Their use should be carefully considered on an individual basis in patients with clearly identified target symptoms followed by close monitoring for improvement.",

Despite this the development of quality of life research has been rather slow in the field but it is evident both from epidemiological and clinical studies that persons with major depression have a substantially lower subjective quality of life than healthy subjects, and that quality of life is severely affected in a number of life domains as well as associated with a worse functioning in various external life conditions. Subjective quality of life has also mostly been found to be worse than in other psychiatric conditions and equal to or worse than quality of life in several major medical chronic illnesses. Although investigations of quality of life in anxiety disorder are growing they are less frequent than in depression and still in its infancy. This is most evident concerning post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and further studies in all anxiety disorders are strongly needed. The general picture emerging from studies performed is that anxiety disorders are illnesses that impair quality of life and social functioning in a number of life domains. There is some evidence that quality of life is most compromised in panic disorder (PD) and PTSD.",

They may aggravate psychiatric disorders, perpetuate them or predict a disease onset, like in depressive or manic episodes. Also in organic sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders or nocturnal movement disorders, increased anxiety or depression scores may be observed. Patients suffering from sleep disorders do not only experience impaired well-being, but also show deteriorations in cognition and performance, have a higher risk of accidents, are generally more prone to health problems, have a higher sickness absence rate, seek medical help more often and thus are also an important socioeconomic factor.

These forces principally revolve around the parents’ fantasies of themselves, both as spouses and as parents. So deep and so strongly held are these fantasies that their threatened loss frequently precipitates acting out and regressive behavior. Often one or both of the parents may appear to be almost psychotic, when previously they were functioning quite well. Children are drawn into this maelstrom, often siding with one or the other parent in a very pathological fashion. Examples of regressive behavior as well as case examples are given.",

      "title": "Burnout syndrome",
      "abstract": "Online dictionaries provide a suggestive translation for the burnout concept: \"The tubes burned out easily and had to be constantly replaced...\".This is the sequence of events that leads to the syndrome: the depletion of one's own intellectual energy, usually directly tied to the profession one has, presumably exerted with great passion and dedication, after a long lasting effort.The most accurate definition, including the eventual prophylactic actions to be taken, is based on the context in which this syndrome manifests: the surpassing of one's resistance to professional effort and of one's capability to recuperate (1,17).Its manifestation, perceived by others and by the affected individual consists of behaviors and feelings, more or less subjective, noticed by the individual and/or those around him/her.The most common symptoms overlap those found in various types of depression: fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood, lack of pleasure and motivation for daily activities concerning -surprisinglythose linked to professional activity.Other symptoms are included in the psychosomatic category: headaches, lumbago, gastrointestinal problems, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, various cenesthetic complaints.If we use the word symptoms we must include our description in the biological model, which is not necessary the case here.Official psychiatric classifications do not recognize burnout as a form of depression.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10, 1992) (2) includes this syndrome in the last chapter (amongst \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" codes Z00-Z99, in \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" code Z73.0 together with other \"problems\", such as \"Accentuation of personality traits\" including type A behavior pattern, \"Lack of relaxation and leisure\", \" Stress, not elsewhere classified\", \"Inadequate social skills, not elsewhere classified\", \"Social role conflict, not elsewhere classified\", ranging from Z73.1 to Z73.5), all of which do not refer to nosological entities, but to particularities varying with context and eventually with the individual's psycho-social vulnerability.We can thus define burnout as a cumulation of psychological symptoms, more or less interchangeable with the psychiatric equivalents, already indexed among the diagnostic criteria of some psychiatric disorders (exhaustion depression, stress disorders etc.) (3).It is true that, given time, these psychological symptoms and disfunctions can translate to actual depressive symptoms.Because burnout is, in fact, a surpassed work-related state, it is wise to be aware that the onset of the symptoms might show a change in the individual's professional life.This means that the professional act, which one performs with a",

      "title": "Daytime Drowsiness",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

      "abstract": "Any systemic or neurological condition can cause sleep disruption. Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

In cancer patients, it is defined as ‘distressing persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning’. In the majority of patients receiving palliative care, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial. The most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation. Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue. Initial management should aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes However, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered.",

The need for holistic approach to frequently long-lasting treatment of a somatic condition, requiring treatment of concomitant mental disorders (anxiety, depression, etc.) is rarely implemented in practice, even if the disorders are properly diagnosed.

The state of one's mental health has a substantial influence on their sense of value, relationships with others, and day-to-day functioning. Signs and symptoms of mental health issues can include enduring feelings of sadness, disruptions in sleep patterns, reduced energy levels, alterations in appetite, changes in behaviour and thoughts, difficulties with concentration, substance abuse, detachment from reality, managing daily stress, problems in relationships, deterioration in personal care, and a noticeable decline in performance at school, work, or social activities. These symptoms may result in social isolation, emotional eruptions, intense rage, suicidal ideation, impaired focus, and challenges in interpersonal interactions. Having an optimal state of mental health can significantly improve the overall quality of life, whilst having a substandard state of well-being can worsen it. There is a strong association between poor mental health and a range of diseases, such as chronic inflammation, cardiovascular dysfunction, asthma, metabolic disorders, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune syndromes, and neurological diseases. Various elements, including biological, psychological, behavioural, dietary, and social factors, might exert an influence on mental health. The government implements actions and projects to improve global mental health, and there are multiple ways available for assessing mental health. Medicinal therapies such as Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and Unani can be utilized to enhance mental health. The extent to which psychological therapy can improve mental health is still a mystery to us. A thorough literature review was conducted using various databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus) and government websites, focusing on mental health, including epidemiology, interventions, and treatment methods. Additionally, the potential impacts of climate change on mental health were examined. This study aimed to address the limitations of previous reviews by evaluating the effectiveness of various psychological interventions, regardless of their theoretical foundation, and assessing the influence of different moderators in a single systematic review and meta-analysis. While further research is needed, the review offers insights into the design of psychological interventions to enhance mental well-being.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The fatigue that arises from work manifests itself as a feeling of constant fatigue or weakness. It can be physical, mental, or a combination of both. The occurrence of fatigue is influenced by physical, mental and sensory loads, night work, psychological and physical factors of the working environment, personality characteristics of the worker. In order to speak with certainty about the impact of work on humans, one must determine precisely in each particular case what type of work it is. In this sense, the difference is made whether it is static or dynamic work. If the factors such as physical and psychological load act longer than the worker can tolerate, there is a psychophysiological overstretchand a state between normal physiological and pathological with a tendency to pass into the pathological form, i.e. disease. Acute and chronic fatigue of health care workers is very common. Given that every healthcare professional during his working life meets with numerous hazards and dangers, it is very important that they are recognized in a certain way, evaluated / ranked in order to pay special attention to these hazards and dangers that represent a potential threat to the safety and health of health workers. In this context, a study of health workers currently employed in the Kotor Health Center, Emergency Medical Service and Kotor General Hospital was conducted with the aim of establishing the connection between acute and chronic fatigue among medical workers with sociodemographic work and life characteristics of respondents. As for the methods in the process of collecting data from the respondents, two questionnaires were used, which the respondents themselves completed the OFER15 questionnaire and the general questionnaire. Based on the analysis of the data, it can be concluded that recovery, acute and chronic fatigue are significantly higher among the hospital medical workers, which corresponds to the number of working hours that is higher compared to the other population that was examined.",

      "abstract": "Актуальность. Депрессивные расстройства в пожилом возрасте часто не распознаются или неадекватно лечатся, утяжеляют течение и прогноз коморбидной патологии, приводят к потере трудоспособности, к еще большему физическому упадку, ухудшают качество жизни не только пациентов, но и их окружения; приводят к суицидальному поведению. При депрессивных расстройствах в пожилом возрасте наблюдается ослабление когнитивных функций, проявляющееся в затруднении при выполнении сложных заданий, замедлении темпа, нарушении концентрации внимания и затруднений в принятии решений. Однако при психометрических исследованиях способности к репродукции, значительных отличий от здоровых пожилых людей часто не выявляются. Целью исследования явилось выделение некоторых клинико-психопатологические особенности депрессий с суицидальным поведением в позднем возрасте. Материалы и методы исследования. Работа проводилась в РГП на ПХВ “Республиканском научно-практическом центре психического здоровья” МЗ РК г. Алматы. Материалом послужили больные депрессией с суицидальным поведением в позднем возрасте, проходившие стационарное лечение в РНПЦ ППН в 2016-2021 гг. Основными методами исследования являлись клинико-психопатологический, клинико-катамнестический, длительность катамнеза составила от 1 до 6 лет. Были использованы также экспериментально-психологический метод, психометрические шкалы: шкалы личностной и ситуативной тревожности (по Спилбергеру), шкала депрессии (по Цунгу) для определения степени выраженности депрессии и тревоги. Результаты. Наблюдение показало, что течение психоза у больных исследуемой группы характеризовалось развитием повторных приступов (один приступ перенесли только 5 больных, что, возможно, объясняется коротким периодом катамнестического наблюдения). В 8 наблюдениях это были монополярные приступы в рамках рекуррентного депрессивного расстройства. В остальных случаях наряду с депрессивными приступами возникали и гипоманиакальные состояния, чаще всего в виде кратковременных подъёмов настроения. Больные, достаточно критически, относились к своей болезни и при этом опасались повторения приступов. Почти у всех больных сохранялась резидуальная аффективная симптоматика. Стертые гипоманиакальные или субдепрессивные состояния возникали аутохтонно, либо в виде реакций на различные внешние раздражители. Выводы. Депрессивные расстройства в позднем возрасте имеют ряд клинических особенностей, представляющих высокую суицидогенность. Преобладание в картине психоза тревожных депрессий, нередко с ажитацией; ипохондрических расстройств, включающих ипохондрические идеи от тревожных и фобических опасений до ипохондрического бреда с разнообразными алгическими сенсациями, повышают суицидальную опасность больных. Introduction. Depressive disorders in old age are often not recognized or inadequately treated, aggravate the course and prognosis of comorbid pathology, lead to disability, to even greater physical decline, worsen the quality of life not only of patients, but also of their environment; lead to suicidal behavior. With depressive disorders in old age, there is a weakening of cognitive functions, manifested in difficulty in performing complex tasks, slowing down the pace, impaired concentration and difficulties in making decisions. However, in psychometric studies of the ability to reproduce, significant differences from healthy elderly people are often not revealed. The aim to identify some clinical and psychopathological features of depression with suicidal behavior at a late age. Materials and methods of research. The work was carried out in the Republican Scientific and Practical center of Mental Health of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The material was used by patients with depression with suicidal behavior at a late age who underwent inpatient treatment at the RSPCMH MH RK in 2016-2021. The main research methods were clinical-psychopathological, clinical-catamnestic, the duration of the catamnesis ranged from 1 to 6 years. An experimental psychological method, psychometric scales were also used: the scales of personal and situational anxiety (according to Spielberger), the scale of depression (according to Tsung) to determine the severity of depression and anxiety. Results. The observation showed that the course of psychosis in the patients of the study group was characterized by the development of repeated seizures (only 5 patients suffered one attack, which may be explained by the short period of catamnestic observation). In 8 cases, these were monopolar seizures within the framework of recurrent depressive disorder. In other cases, along with depressive attacks, hypomanic states also occurred, most often in the form of short-term mood swings. The patients were quite critical of their illness and at the same time were afraid of a recurrence of seizures. Almost all patients retained residual affective symptoms. Erased hypomanic or subdepressive states occurred autochthonously or in the form of reactions to various external stimuli. Conclusions. Depressive disorders in late life have a number of clinical features that represent high suicidogenicity. The predominance of anxiety depressions in the picture of psychosis, often with agitation; hypochondriac disorders, including hypochondriac ideas from anxiety and phobic fears to hypochondriac delirium with various algic sensations, increase the suicidal danger of patients. Өзектілігі. Егде жастағы депрессиялық бұзылулар жиі анықталмайды немесе жеткіліксіз емделеді, қатар жүретін патологияның барысы мен болжамын ауырлатады, еңбекке жарамсыздыққа, одан да көп физикалық құлдырауға әкеледі, пациенттердің ғана емес, сонымен қатар олардың қоршаған ортасының өмір сүру сапасын нашарлатады; суицидтік мінез-құлыққа әкеледі. Егде жастағы депрессиялық бұзылуларда когнитивті функциялардың әлсіреуі байқалады, бұл күрделі тапсырмаларды орындаудағы қиындықтарда, қарқынның баяулауында, зейіннің нашарлауында және шешім қабылдаудағы қиындықтарда көрінеді. Алайда, психометриялықзерттеулерде ұрпақ өрбіту қабілетінде, дені сау егде жастағы адамдардан айтарлықтай айырмашылықтар жиі анықталмайды. Зерттеудің мақсатыегде жастағы суицидтік мінез-құлықпен депрессияның клиникалық-психопатологиялық ерекшеліктерінің кейбіреулерін бөліп көрсету болды. Зерттеу материалдары мен әдістері. Жұмыс ҚРДМ “Республикалық психикалық денсаулық ғылыми-практикалық орталығы” ШЖҚ РМК жүргізілді. Материал 2016-2021 жылдары “РПДҒПО” стационарлық емдеуден өткен егде жастағы суицидтік мінез-құлқы бар депрессиямен ауыратын науқастар болды. Зерттеудің негізгі әдістері клиникалық-психопатологиялық, клиникалық-катамнестикалық болды, катамнездің ұзақтығы 1 жылдан 6 жылға дейін болды. Эксперименттік-психологиялық әдіс, психометриялық шкалалар да қолданылды: жеке және ситуациялық мазасыздық шкалалары (Спилбергер бойынша), депрессия мен мазасыздықтың ауырлығын анықтау үшін депрессия шкаласы (Цунг бойынша) қолданылды. Нәтижелер. Бақылау көрсеткендей, зерттеу тобындағы науқастардағы психоздың ағымы қайталанған шабуылдардың дамуымен сипатталды (тек 5 науқас бір шабуылға ұшырады, бұл катамнестикалық бақылаудың қысқа кезеңімен түсіндірілуі мүмкін). 8 бақылауда бұл қайталанатын депрессиялық бұзылыстың бөлігі ретінде монополярлық шабуылдар болды. Басқа жағдайларда, депрессиялық шабуылдармен қатар, гипоманикалық жағдайлар да пайда болды, көбінесе қысқа мерзімді көңіл-күйдің көтерілуі түрінде. Науқастар өздерінің ауруларына өте сын көзбен қарады және сонымен бірге шабуылдардың қайталануынан қорқады. Барлық дерлік науқастарда резидуальды аффективті белгілер сақталды. Жойылған гипоманикалық немесе субдепрессиялық күйлер аутохтонды немесе әртүрлі сыртқы ынталандыруларға реакциялар түрінде пайда болды. Қорытынды: Егде жастағы депрессиялық бұзылулар жоғары суицидогенділікті білдіретін бірқатар клиникалық белгілерге ие. Зерттеу көрсеткендей егде жастағы мазасыздық депрессиясының, психоздың басым болуы, көбінесе толқумен; гипохондриялық бұзылулар, соның ішінде гипохондриялық идеялар, мазасыздық пен фобиялық қорқыныштан бастап, әртүрлі алгиялық сенсациялары бар гипохондриялықсандыраққа дейін, науқастардың суицидтік қаупін арттыратыны анықталды.",

      "abstract": "Similar to the setting of other chronic, debilitating diseases, considerable psychoeducational support of the patient's family and other caregivers represents an often-overlooked component of appropriately thorough care. Nearly three of four persons caring for an individual with PD report psychological stress and anxiety, which are exacerbated by concerns about progression of the disease. Counseling for PD caregivers can be dispensed particularly effectively through individual psychological counseling as well as PD support and community self-help groups that assist caregivers in sharing concerns and promote a sense they are understood by others. Through such measures, which may be delivered effectively by nurse practitioners, PD caregivers can develop effective coping strategies for disease related stressors. Empirical results show the most common stressors are: anxiety, concern about the future, impatience or intolerance, loss of autonomy, sleep disturbances, diminished time and opportunity for recreation and social contact, and anger. These sequelae often ensue when the PD patient evidences depression, advanced dementia, or psychosis, each of which can severely constrain communication. Caregivers often must also contend with two other adverse psychological phenomena: cognitive dissonance surrounding placement of the patient in a nursing home and learned helplessness, which may predispose to depressive states. Other often unmet needs of the \"hidden victims\" of PD include compromised immune function, social stigmata, and financial difficulties. Respite care may be useful in reducing the stress associated with these and other problems frequently affecting caregivers.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders represent one of the leading problems of the public health community in the modern world today, especially because their incidence is steadily increasing and they are one of the main reasons for the overall disease burden in Europe. One of the most frequently diagnosed, yet under recognized diseases, is depression. Depression, whether a symptom, part of a syndrome or an independent diagnosis, is characterized by feelings of sadness, loss of interest and pleasure in activities that normally bring joy to a person, and can affect how a person feels, thinks and behaves. It affects all age and social groups, as well as both sexes, it is often comorbid with other physical diseases, and increases the risk of developing other physical diseases. There are certain differences between the sexes in the prevalence, the way a certain sex group deals with problems caused by depression, and the possible causes of these differences, which we present in more detail in this paper. Differences are observed in all cultures, environments and across different age groups. Patients suffering from depression have a particularly high risk of committing suicide. Suicide is a psychopathological phenomenon of multifactorial aetiology that is most often associated with psychiatry and mental disorders and is not a diagnosis in itself, but a complication of many psychiatric disorders. here are many differences in the rate of suicide by age and sex, as well as in the method of suicide, which we also present in more detail in this paper.",

The following are the most critical aspects of the recommended chronic stress model. 1/ Stress contains both sympathetic and parasympathetic elements, but the latter predominate. 2/ The mediator of stress is carbon dioxide, the substance that can turn the psyche into soma. 3/ In humans, chronic stress is mainly social; people cause it to each other. Chronic social stress is created frequently due to deviations in civilisation, education and tolerance. 4/ The freeze response (or freezing behaviour) plays a subordinate role in the animal world; it lasts mainly for a maximum of minutes, while in humans, it dominates and can continue for decades. 5/ The decisive step of freeze is apnea, hypopnea, which occurs due to aversive psychological eff ects. After a more extended existence, mild chronic respiratory acidosis develops and most often appears in the clinical form of obstructive sleep apnea. 6/ Chronic hypercapnia can shape the metabolism into metabolic syndrome. 7/ After that, various cardiovascular and metabolic complications (hypertension, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, depression) may develop - partly due to genetic and lifestyle reasons.

      "title": "Case report: Depression in an older patient with dysgeusia as the initial symptom",
      "abstract": "Introduction Depression is the most common mental illness among older adults, with substantial and persistent mood depression as the main clinical feature, which is unfavorable for improvement. The clinical manifestations can range from melancholy to grief or even numbness. Approximately one-third of older adult patients exhibit physical discomfort as the first symptom; dysgeusia as the first symptom, is very rare in clinical practice. Dysgeusia is a clinical symptom with no specific objective indicator; thus, the likelihood of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis is high. Case presentation In this study, a 60-year-old female housewife with elementary school as her highest level of education, presented to the outpatient department with dysgeusia, poor sleep, and poor mood persisting for &amp;gt;1 year, which aggravated 2 weeks before hospital visit. Psychiatric examination showed clear consciousness; the patient was cleanly and timely dressed and demonstrated self-care but had a worrisome expression. Using the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (10 th edition), a diagnosis of a major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms was made. Following pharmacological and psychological treatment, the patient’s condition improved. The patient was compliant to treatment (10 mg/day of escitalopram), had a stable mood, good sleep, and no dysgeusia at &amp;gt;2 years of follow-up as an outpatient. She was able to do housework and take care of her children normally and did not complain about any other issues. Conclusion Physical discomfort is a very common complaint in older patients with depression. If persistent physical symptoms do not improve after repeated medical treatment, timely assessment of the patient’s mental state or psychiatric referral should be considered to diagnose geriatric depression. Timely pharmacological and psychological therapy are the preferred treatment for older adults.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms vary moment-to-moment within a day. One factor that may influence these variations is chronotype. Evening chronotypes prefer to engage in activities (e.g., sleep, physical and social activity) later in the day, and evening chronotype is implicated in psychopathology, including anxiety-related disorders. However, it is unknown whether chronotype influences diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and whether these effects are amplified in individuals with a probable anxiety-related disorder. We examined the diurnal variation in anxiety symptoms and daily activities in morning and evening chronotypes with and without probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a community sample of adults (N = 410). Evening chronotypes reported higher anxiety symptoms, particularly in the evening hours, and lower engagement in daily activities, predominantly in the morning hours. Evening chronotypes with probable GAD or OCD reported worse anxiety symptoms in the evening. Our findings indicate that anxiety symptoms and engagement in daily activities fluctuate considerably across the day, and these patterns differ depending on chronotype. Evening chronotypes have more anxiety symptoms in the evening, despite preferring this time of day. Personalized treatment approaches that consider chronotype and target certain times of day may be efficient in alleviating peaks in anxiety symptoms.",

      "title": "Prescribing for depressed adolescents: Office decision-making in the face of limited research evidence",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a relatively common, disabling, potentially life-threatening medical condition.1 MDD is diagnosed when there are five or more symptoms occurring over 2 or more weeks.2 Adult and adolescent symptoms of MDD are almost the same. However, irritable mood and lack of weight gain can qualify as depressive symptoms in adolescents.2 The lifetime prevalence of unipolar depression (MDD or dysthymic disorder) in adolescence is 11.7%; three-quarters of this percentage suffer severe impairment.3 Adolescent MDD has very high levels of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders.4 Depression is the condition most commonly implicated in adolescent and adult suicide.5 Adolescent depression runs a remitting and relapsing course, often recurring later in adolescence or adulthood6, 7 (see Fig. 1). Of those adolescents who recover from their depression, about 50% will have another depressive episode in the next 5 years.6, 8 In summary, adolescent MDD is a serious and sometimes chronic medical condition that requires assertive treatment. Course of adolescent major depression. *No depressive symptoms for over 2 months. A number of antidepressants have come onto the market since 1987 that provide fewer side effects at therapeutic dose and in overdose than the older tricyclic antidepressants.9, 10 These newer agents include the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram), the serotonin–norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine) and the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (e.g. mirtazapine). The prescribing of antidepressants to children and adolescents has increased from 1996 to 2007.11 Overall, 19% of Australian paediatricians and 68% of child psychiatrists self-report prescribing SSRIs.12 However, this is very unlikely to be specifically for major depression, as paediatricians prescribe across a broad variety of diagnoses and at times for off-label conditions. The SSRIs are a class of antidepressant that have a high affinity for blocking the presynaptic serotonin transport proteins but not the other monoamine transmembrane transport proteins.13 SSRIs differ in their effects through secondary binding to non-serotonergic receptors,14 the antidepressant effects of their metabolites, their excretion half-lives and their effect on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system.15 Despite their differences, the available SSRIs are all effective treatments for moderate adult depression16 and display similar overall side effect profiles.15 In 2004, evidence emerged from antidepressant trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies that there was an increase in suicidal thoughts and behaviours in children and adolescents given antidepressants. In October 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered that pharmaceutical companies add a ‘black box’ warning on all antidepressant medication warning of the heightened risk of suicidality.17 There have been several key guidelines, meta-analyses and papers published since the FDA black box warning that have added further information in an attempt to clarify the role of antidepressants in the treatment of depressed adolescents. Despite the increasing amount of information available, it is our contention that the available literature remains limited and at times contradictory about prescribing. A selective review of the key papers is provided with a discussion on the implication for practice-based management of depressed adolescents. The association of antidepressants and suicidal behaviour in adolescents is discussed elsewhere.18 Do antidepressant drugs work at all in adolescent depression? There is universal agreement that tricyclic antidepressants have no role in the treatment of adolescent depression. A Cochrane meta-analysis found that there was no difference in the rate of recovery in children and adolescents with depressive disorder between those given tricyclic antidepressants and those given placebo treatments.19 The randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English peer-reviewed journals for the treatment of adolescent or combined adolescent/child depression (n = 14) are shown in Table 1. The majority of the studies were industry-funded and were conducted in North America. Unpublished and non-English-language studies on nefazodone, citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine and mirtazapine have been noted elsewhere.34-37 Fluoxetine is the drug with the most consistent positive response, in three out of the four studies. On the basis of evidence of efficacy from RCTs, the FDA has approved both fluoxetine, in 2003,38 and escitalopram (the active enantiomer of citalopram), in 2009, for use in adolescent depression.39 While seven studies show superiority of drug over placebo, the reported findings from some of the studies have been queried since publication. A study of sertraline by Wagner et al. (2003) that reported positive results had in fact pooled two studies with the same methodology.25 When each of the sertraline studies is taken on its own there is no significance in either study.18 Jureidini (2008) noted that the significant difference between paroxetine and placebo reported by Keller et al. (2001) was found using measures not cited in the original protocol (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression depressed mood item, Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia – Lifetime depressed mood item, Clinical Global Impression).40 It is possible that the outcomes reported from each of the RCTs may be influenced by the variables related to the study design, medication compliance, placebo response rate and the nature of the cohort recruited.37, 41-43 The differences between the studies restrict direct comparison of their reported findings. The limitations of single RCTs point us to systematic reviews with meta-analyses that have the capacity to pool data and address the problem of small sample sizes.44 An early meta-analysis (n = 5 RCTs) reported a small effect size for antidepressants over placebo, with suggested negligible clinical benefit.45 Tsapakis et al. (n = 29 RCTs including tricyclics) reported an overall number needed to treat (NNT) of 9, with a higher response rate in adolescents compared with children.46 Hetrick, McKenzie and Merry (n = 12 RCTs)47 and Whittington et al. (n = 5 RCTs)48 reported a modest benefit for fluoxetine over placebo. In summary, these meta-analyses found small effect sizes that have been interpreted as reflecting limited to negligible clinical improvement. The most recent Cochrane review (n = 19 RCTs) of 3335 participants treated with newer antidepressants (paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, mirtazapine, venlafaxine)35 found a small statistically significant difference in response/remission favouring antidepressants over placebo, but this finding was qualified as being not clinically meaningful.35 Other authors came to different conclusions. Bridge et al. (n = 15 RCTs) found in their meta-analysis that the NNT for antidepressants in children and adolescent MDD was 10 but advocated for ‘the cautious and well monitored’ use of antidepressants.37 Other techniques have been used to assess antidepressant efficacy. Gibbons et al. (2012) pooled all the data from each participant in the fluoxetine RCT studies (n = 708) over the first 6 weeks of treatment, arguing this approach was superior to a meta-analysis as it utilised all the data available.49 Gibbons et al. found that using fluoxetine compared with placebo, the NNT for response to treatment was 4.49 Higher response and remission rates were reported for fluoxetine in depressed youth than adults.49 The overall findings suggest that there is evidence for the efficacy of fluoxetine and less evidence for that of other antidepressants in the short term. The various complex analyses, in the main, have been confusing, as different authors have argued for exclusion of selected RCTs from analysis depending on their orientation.46, 50, 51 Further, meta-analysis itself is not an exact science and is open to some interpretation depending on which studies are included, the quality of the studies and the nature of the statistical analysis (fixed-effects vs. random-effects regression).37, 52 Some studies that have compared combined cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication treatments to monotherapeutic approaches for adolescent depression have shown differences in the relative efficacy of CBT, antidepressants or combination after 3 months.31, 53 However, there is convergence in efficacy across all the treatments (medication vs. CBT vs. combination) in the subsequent months53, 54 and years.8 In a meta-analysis of five RCTs, antidepressants (predominantly fluoxetine) have been shown to be equivalent to a combination of antidepressant and CBT at 26 and 36 weeks' follow-up.55 These findings challenge the assumption that two treatments are ultimately better than one. In contrast, for adolescents with MDD who do not respond to the initial SSRI, changing to another antidepressant (SSRI or venlafaxine), especially in conjunction with CBT, has been shown to result in an improvement in depressive symptoms in half of patients.56 In this treatment-resistant group the change to a combination of CBT and antidepressant or another antidepressant led to 38.9% achieving remission at 24 weeks.57 RCTs of antidepressant efficacy have typically aimed to examine short-term outcome (2 to 3 months). Adolescent depressive disorder runs a relapsing, remitting course into early adulthood.6 There have been two placebo-controlled studies of children and adolescents with MDD looking at relapse prevention.58, 59 Over 32 weeks' (n = 40) and 6 months' (n = 102) follow-up of patients who remitted from MDD, fewer patients relapsed on fluoxetine than placebo, and those on placebo relapsed more quickly than those on fluoxetine,58, 59 providing preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of fluoxetine in reducing risk of MDD relapse. Kennard et al. conducted a pilot study of adolescents with MDD (n = 46) who had responded to fluoxetine, randomising them to CBT and fluoxetine or fluoxetine only over the next 6 months.60 Those adolescents who were given CBT and fluoxetine were eight times less likely to relapse than those who received medication alone.60 There is early evidence that in the continuation phase of treatment (6 to 12 months after the acute phase), there is a role for antidepressant and possibly CBT prophylaxis to prevent relapse. Depression in children and adolescents is associated with parental depression.61 This association is likely to be mediated by genetic susceptibility; exposure to parental depressive emotions, cognitions and behaviours; and increased familial stresses. Intervention studies to treat depressed parents have largely focused on maternal depression.62 For depressed adolescents whose mothers are concurrently depressed, treating the mother's depression has been shown to improve internalising disorders in their offspring.63 This improvement continues at 12-month follow-up.64 These studies, taken together, point to the importance of looking at the whole family system and not just treating the adolescent in isolation. There are several clinical practice guidelines that incorporate these research findings and expert opinion to assist paediatricians in the management of the depressed adolescent. The Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care treatment (GLAD-PC) were published in 2007,65 the beyondblue Clinical Practice Guidelines were released in 2010,66 and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines were released in 200567 and updated in 2011 without change. The NICE guidelines recommend that children and adolescents with moderate to severe depression should be offered, as first-line treatment, CBT, interpersonal therapy or short-term family therapy of at least 3 months' duration. Antidepressants should only be prescribed if the adolescent has moderate to severe depression, is assessed by a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services tier 2 or 3 professional and is receiving concurrent psychological treatment. The beyondblue guidelines recommend that fluoxetine should be considered for reduction of depressive symptoms in the short term where psychological treatment has failed, is inaccessible or is refused.66 The GLAD-PC guidelines recommend using an SSRI for moderate to severe depression, outlining dosing regiments for six different SSRIs.65 The NICE guidelines appear to be the most conservative in their recommendations and the GLAD-PC the most liberal. The recommendation for the use of antidepressants in the short term by the beyondblue guidelines is in line with the evidence base, which, in the main, has investigated short-term outcomes of depression. A number of factors limit the clinician's ability to apply RCT findings in his or her practice.68 The RCTs described use placebos, are short-term and are not representative of those depressed adolescents who present in the clinician's office. Hetrick, McKenzie and Merry reported that the children and adolescents in RCTs were unlike those who presented for treatment, who were suffering with lower levels of comorbidity and suicidality.47 The paediatrician often sees patients who would be excluded from most of the adolescent depression RCTs. For instance, there is scant information about the assessment of use of antidepressants in those with MDD and developmental disability,69 leaving them therapeutic orphans. Further, the clinician does not have the option of using a placebo. If the likelihood of a short-term response is 61% on an antidepressant,37 where does that leave the prescribing clinician? It is very likely that many clinicians will consider trialling an SSRI. Seligman (1998) has made the point that the aims of clinical trials overlap with those of the practicing clinician, but they are not the same thing. Seligman notes that clinical trials are largely short-term, single-intervention studies, usually focusing on a single outcome (e.g. reduction in depressive symptoms).70 By contrast, clinical work is, in the main, a long-term engagement, involving multiple treatments that are self-correcting.70 The decision to medicate, while guided by the available research, is also directed by the adolescent's severity of symptoms, unique strengths and vulnerabilities, family factors, access to mental health services and individual wishes of the patient and his or her parents. The paediatrician is well placed to integrate all these factors. The treatment guidelines for adolescent depression suggest that the role of antidepressants is as a second-line treatment for moderate to severe depression as part of stepped treatment where there has been inadequate response to psychological therapies. Of the antidepressants, fluoxetine has the strongest evidence of efficacy; however, the evidence is largely short-term. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that fluoxetine can prevent relapse. Tricyclics have no role in the treatment of adolescent depression. CBT may be added to an antidepressant; however, evidence of an additive effect is limited. Effectiveness studies are largely unavailable, and treatment response rates may vary in clinical practice. If an adolescent and his or her mother are both depressed, then both are likely to benefit if the mother is the one who takes and responds to an antidepressant.",

      "abstract": "Introducción El sueño es un estado natural y fisiológico rítmico, aparece por la melatonina activada por la oscuridad, esto disminuye la conciencia, inmovilidad, relajación muscular. También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

      "title": "STRESS AND HEART",
      "abstract": "Background : Human beings throughout the world are faced with high and ever increasing levels of acute or chronic stress. Acute stress is defined as “the normal short-term physiological response to the perception of major threat or demands”. Chronic stress is defined as “the abnormal ongoing physiological response to the continuing perception of irresolvable major threats or demands”. 1 In fact, all these modern definitions of stress date back to the time of Hans Selye, the first scientist who studied the effects of stress on health and physiological integrity of living organisms. 2 Accordingly, the term stress pertains to effects of all environmental and psychosocial factors on physical or mental well-being. 1 The effect of stress on cardiovascular system has bean discussed for many years, 3 although until recently, the evidence has been relatively weak due to the complexity of such a relationship. 4 Among the many different types of stressors, mental and psychosocial stressors exert profound effects on the circulatory system. Primary studies on the relationship of stress with cardiovascular disease focused mainly on type A personality, then shifting to more specific components, i.e. hostility and anger, as stressful factors that provoke cardiovascular problems. 5 Behavioral or psychosocial stress induces or influences the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect. Psychosocial stress has been demonstrated to increase oxidative stress which disturbs endothelial integrity and induces endothelial injury and dysfunction. 6 These processes activate beta 1-adrenoceptors that cause sympathoadrenal activation, which in turn enhances atherosclerosis. Also, behavioral or psychosocial stressors decrease estrogen, which may be of importance for the development of premenopausal atherosclerosis. 7 (1) HamidReza Roohafza MD. Psychiatrist,  Mental Health Research Unit, Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center. Email: roohafza@crc.mui.ac.ir Stress is strongly associated with CAD. Clinically, mental stress is a cause of angina and may specifically worsen CAD. By provoking a dynamic decrease in coronary supply, mental stress may activate the ischemic response and induce substantial myocardial ischemia, and in the long term adversely affect prognosis in CAD patients. 8,9 Hostility and anger have also been shown to negatively influence ejection fraction and myocardial blood circulation, pointing out the importance of these phenomena as the etiology of CAD. 5 However, other forms of stress also have an impact. Behavioral/ psychosocial stress may participate in the development of CAD, via neuroendocrine mediation through sympathoadrenal activation (chronic sympathetic hyperarousal), seen clinically in angina/chest pain associated with normal coronary angiograms. 10 Stress clearly has the potential to actively trigger threatening cardiac events that lead to myocardial infarction. Mental stress increases the myocardial oxygen demand via sympathoadrenal activation and also involves a reduction in the myocardial oxygen supply, an eventually fatal consequence. 11 Mental stress obviously has a profound impact on long-term cardiac events and outcome. In particular, mental stress may cause paradoxical constrictions in patients with CAD/atherosclerosis, especially at points of stenosis - a response that correlates with the extent of atherosclerosis (plaque) and with the endothelium-dependent response to an infusion of acetylcholine (verification of endothelial dysfunction). 12 Discussion : Stress contributes to the onset, development, progression, and treatment delay of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. The prevalence of stress is high in both developing and developed countries, 13 an example of which is a large multicomponent interventional project on lifestyle habits performed in Iran, named Isfahan Healthy Heart Program, the results of which show high stress levels in 40% of men and 45% of women. 14 Thus, ‘lifestyle’ needs to be a central focus of prevention, 13 as this ‘epidemic of stress’ 1 may turn into a critical medical issue. Stress management interventions such as cognitive behavioral strategies to improve adaptive methods, and the use of relaxation response techniques are of growing importance in the future. 14",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

      "title": "Depression and Suicide",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Most youth occasionally experience the blues, feel sad, or become irritable. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the possibility of a depressive disorder when a depressed or irritable mood is more than temporary, occurs in conjunction with other symptoms, or interferes with daily functioning. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is manifested by a depressed or irritable mood or diminished interest or pleasure that lasts for at least 2 weeks. This is accompanied by changes in cognitive and physical functioning. Dysthymic disorder (DD) is a less severe type of depression that involves chronic symptoms and lasts for at least 1 year. These specific types of depressive disorders are the focus of this article.Depressive disorders can be identified in children of all ages, but they become increasingly prevalent during adolescence. In fact, the peak ages of depressive symptom onset in lifespan studies are 15 to 19 years and 25 to 29 years. The sharpest rise in prevalence occurs among girls during adolescence and early adulthood. Approximately 2% of school-age children and 4% to 6% of adolescents struggle with MDD at any one point in time. Lifetime prevalence rates by late adolescence range between 20% and 25%.Prior to puberty, there is about a 1:1 gender ratio for depressive disorders. After puberty, this shifts to a 2:1 ratio of females to males, which continues throughout adulthood. A combination of hormonal and social changes during puberty may explain the differing rates of depression among males and females.Depression has a complex genetic and environmental basis. Adoption, twin, and family studies all point to the impact of genetic factors, which seem to establish a young person's biologic vulnerability for depression. The onset of a depressive episode, however, often is precipitated by difficult life events or stressful experiences such as a parental divorce, school change, or relationship breakup. Other environmental risk factors include maltreatment (sexual abuse, physical abuse, or neglect). The pathways to depression are complex and variable. Some depressive disorders are more biologic; others are more situational.The symptoms of MDD and DD, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), include changes in physical, cognitive, and emotional domains (Tables 1 and 2).In 1996, the World Health Organization ranked depression among the most disabling of all diseases in the world, leading all other disorders in \"years lived with disabilities.\" The reasons for this are apparent when one considers the course of depressive illness. Approximately 70% of youth who have MDD experience another depressive episode within 5 years, and youth who have depressive disorders have a fourfold risk of an adult depressive disorder. Approximately 50% of children and adolescents who have MDD can be expected to have adult recurrences. Early onset and recurrences also have been described as a cause of treatment-resistant depression in later life, leading to multiple episodes that last longer, become more severe, and become more difficult to treat. These tend to be associated with more hospitalizations, job absenteeism, and impaired work performance.Depressive disorders in youth are associated with impaired functioning in several areas of daily living. These include strained family and peer relationships, school attendance difficulties, and academic performance problems. Affected youth often experience suicidal thoughts and are at increased risk for attempted and completed suicide.Early-onset bipolar disorder (BD) often presents as depressive symptoms, which can make it difficult to distinguish between bipolar and unipolar depression. BD is characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression. The inflated self-esteem, excess energy, and poor judgment that characterize a manic phase often result in dangerous activity and substantial social problems. Rapid cycling and mixed symptom states occur in subtypes of BD. Approximately 20% to 40% of children who have MDD eventually develop BD. Some clues to the risk for developing a manic or hypomanic episode include psychosis, psychomotor retardation, or a family history of BD.Another potential diagnostic dilemma occurs when a child or adolescent is abusing alcohol or drugs. Youth are not always forthcoming about such abuse, which may be associated with declining school performance, withdrawal from usual social activities, sleep disturbance, and negative moods. Careful questioning of the youth and parent/guardian is necessary to identify a substance use disorder in youth presenting with depressive symptoms. It can be equally challenging to identify a depressive disorder in youth initially identified for services because of problems related to alcohol or substance abuse.Most children and adolescents who are depressed also have a history of some other psychiatric or alcohol/drug use disorder. For example, 25% to 75% of depressed youth have one or more anxiety disorders, such as separation anxiety disorder or social phobia. Disruptive behavior disorders, such as attention-deficit disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, are also common, and substance abuse or dependence characterizes a significant minority of youth who are depressed. A gender difference exists in patterns of comorbidity. Girls more commonly have comorbid anxiety conditions; boys are more likely to have comorbid conduct disorders or substance use disorders.Children and adolescents rarely seek professional treatment. Thus, parents, teachers, pediatricians, and others who have regular contact with youth play critical roles in recognizing youth who are depressed. Few youth use the word \"depressed\"; even fewer report to someone that they may be experiencing a clinical depression. Therefore, it is helpful to ask youth about experiences of feeling down, \"bad,\" miserable, bored, or irritated. Signs of clinical depression that often initially are visible to others include withdrawal from activities, decline in school performance, change in sleep patterns, and sadness or irritability.The United States Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended the use of two questions in screening for depression among adults: \"Over the past 2 weeks, have you ever felt down, depressed, or hopeless?\" and \"Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?\" The Task Force concluded that evidence is inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of routine screening of children and adolescents, but these two questions may help clinicians detect primary symptoms of depression. More comprehensive screening instruments and diagnostic tools or a referral to a mental health professional should be considered if indicated. The Reynolds Adolescent Depression Inventory (RADS) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) are screening tools used in some school and mental health clinics.Clinical interviews are the cornerstone of a comprehensive assessment and should include, at a minimum, interviews with the youth as well as the parent or guardian. In addition to gathering a complete history of presenting problems (onset, chronicity, severity, prior history of symptoms, and treatment), a full psychiatric interview is conducted to obtain information about possible comorbid conditions. For example, it is critical to ascertain whether psychotic features, disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, or substance abuse problems are present. Information also is gathered about the youth's medical, developmental, social, and educational histories as well as the family psychiatric history.Important sources of information may include school academic and attendance records; teacher reports; and appropriate biomedical, psychological, or other test findings. Standardized self-report questionnaires may permit youths to answer questions about current symptoms without directly verbalizing the extent of their emotional distress to an adult. This approach sometimes can facilitate honest reporting of the number and severity of depressive symptoms. If noted in a self-report questionnaire, critical items always should be followed up with direct inquiry by the clinician (eg, if a youth reports suicidal ideation).The initial goals of treatment are to ensure the youth's safety and develop an effective therapeutic alliance with the youth and parents. This alliance will facilitate ongoing communication and continuation of care. Consultation with teachers and other caregivers also is important. A focus on patient and family education and a collaborative approach to treatment planning can enhance the youth's adherence to treatment recommendations.Psychoeducation is a key component of the treatment. Beyond this, perspectives on the first line of treatment vary. The choice of whether to begin with psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic interventions or a combination depends on depression severity and chronicity, prior history of depressive episodes, likelihood of adherence, previous response to treatment, patient and family motivation for treatment, and availability of resources. Because of the psychological, environmental, and social problems associated with depression and its treatment, pharmacotherapy usually is not sufficient as the sole treatment. Attention to parental mental health and family stress as well as to strategies for helping parents manage the youth's irritability, isolation, or other problems should be included in psychotherapeutic interventions. These systemic concerns affect treatment adherence and ultimate outcomes.Psychoeducation addresses the signs and symptoms of depression; the importance of psychotherapy and psychiatric medication; and common misconceptions about the illness, therapy, or medications. It also is helpful to address the impact that depression has on school, social, and family functioning and the ways in which parents and teachers may aid in recovery. Parent and family education may increase adherence and reduce self-blame. Education of parents can help them identify their own mood disorders and potential treatment needs as well. Education also can reduce blame for symptoms such as irritability and anhedonia that may affect others.Controlled studies have documented the short-term effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) for depressed youth. Both generally are time-limited therapies that involve collaboration or guided discovery between the therapist and adolescent. CBT focuses on self-understanding of negative mood states and on the identification and modification of negative, distorted thought patterns. It also emphasizes problem-solving skills, communication skills, and the development of more adaptive behavior patterns. IPT strives to improve the youth's interpersonal functioning by improving self-understanding, problem-solving, communication, and coping in the realm of relationships. It focuses on a chosen interpersonal problem such as grief, a difficult role transition, an interpersonal conflict or role dispute, social skill deficits, or issues in step-parent families. Although randomized, controlled clinical trials have not been conducted for psychodynamic therapy with depressed youth, this approach may be useful. Family therapy is an important supplement to any of these approaches if difficulties in family communication and support are identified. Goals of family therapy may include improving family affective communication, increasing adaptive behaviors, and changing both interpersonal and family functioning.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the antidepressants of choice for youth who require pharmacotherapy (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 1998). The efficacy of the SSRI fluoxetine in reducing depressive symptom severity in children and adolescents has been demonstrated in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Paroxetine also has demonstrated efficacy compared with imipramine and placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison. Other antidepressant medications are not well studied. Dosing guidelines recommend starting with 10 mg fluoxetine and increasing to 20 mg. The maximum dose is 40 mg to 80 mg. When treating a child younger than 8 years of age, clinicians may want to start with 4 to 8 mg elixir of fluoxetine. However, the efficacy and safety data have been demonstrated only down to age 8 years. If there are problems with insomnia, appetite loss, or restlessness, paroxetine is a more sedating SSRI, and dosing guidelines are identical to those for fluoxetine. SSRIs should be discontinued if symptoms of mania appear. However, youth may benefit from treatment with an SSRI for an extended period before BD develops.An adequate trial of SSRIs is at least 4 to 6 weeks. If no or only minimal improvement is observed, a dose increase should be considered and medication continued for at least 4 to 6 additional weeks. If no improvement has been observed, alternative strategies should be considered, including a referral to a psychiatrist in cases of treatment-resistant depression. Additionally, if the pediatrician is not comfortable in the prescriber role, a psychiatric consultation or referral to a physician experienced in the use of medication is recommended. Frequent medication adjustments are ill-advised, and tapering of medications that have shorter half-lives (eg, paroxetine) is recommended. Obtaining serum levels rarely is necessary unless concerns arise about toxicity or compliance. Studies among adults suggest that the same doses used to treat MDD are efficacious for DD.Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are not considered a first-line treatment for children and adolescents who are depressed, but they may be helpful in treating youth who have comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, enuresis, and narcolepsy as well as for augmentation purposes.In contrast to TCAs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs have a relatively safe adverse effects profile, are easily used (once daily), are suitable for long-term maintenance, and have a low lethality after overdose. Additional information on adverse effects, medication interactions, and the treatment of comorbid conditions is available in reviews of practice recommendations published by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.ECT can be a useful adjunct for individuals whose depression is severe or life-threatening, who have not responded to other treatments, who cannot take antidepressant medications, and who may have psychotic depression. The decision to use ECT must be made carefully and usually requires the recommendation of more than one psychiatrist as well as a substantial discussion with the child's parent or guardian.Unless there are significant adverse effects, medication should be continued for 6 to 12 months if it is believed to help in the remission of depressive symptoms. The pharmacotherapy should be monitored monthly during this continuation phase. Psychotherapy is helpful during this phase to bolster coping skills and to address antecedents, stressors, and interpersonal conflicts that may have contributed to the onset of depression. Medication adherence also may be improved by psychotherapy.Once the patient's symptoms have remitted for 6 to 12 months, the maintenance phase of treatment may last from 1 year to indefinitely. The goals are to facilitate healthy development and to prevent relapse or recurrence. These may be accomplished through monthly or quarterly visits, depending on the severity and chronicity of the present episode, frequency of previous episodes, comorbid disorders, the patient's motivation, and contextual factors (eg, support systems, family stress, and psychopathology).The presence of comorbid conditions often predicts a poorer response to psychopharmacologic and psychosocial treatments. These conditions, such as anxiety, disruptive behavior, and substance use disorders, often persist after remission of the depressive symptoms and require targeted treatments. Because of time, cost, or the incompatibility of treatments, addressing all conditions simultaneously may be impossible. Hence, the clinician often must prioritize treatment goals and the sequence of interventions.A depressive disorder may be \"treatment-resistant\" because of an inadequate dosage or duration of medication trial, inadequate duration or \"fit\" with a particular psychotherapy, poor treatment adherence, complicating comorbidity, undetected BD, chronic or severe life events, misdiagnosis, or mistreatment. Psychopharmacologic strategies to address treatment-resistant depression should be applied systematically in conjunction with family education and support and include optimization, switching, augmentation, or combination. Consultation with a psychiatrist always is advised with treatment-resistant cases.If BD is present or is a possibility, a mood-stabilizing agent (eg, lithium carbonate, valproate, or carbamazepine) may be warranted, especially because antidepressants may induce mania in youths at risk for BD. Approximately 30% to 50% of adults experience modest antidepressant effects with mood stabilizers alone. Antidepressants may be useful adjuncts in such treatments. Psychotic depression may require a combination of antidepressants with antipsychotics or ECT. Neuroleptics should be tapered after psychotic symptoms remit due to the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Atypical antipsychotic medications may be preferred. However, the long-term effects of these medications have not been studied in youth.Suicide is the third leading cause of death among children and adolescents (National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, 2000). The suicide rate for ages 15 to 24 years is 11.1 per 100,000, which is much higher than the rate for youth between the ages of 5 and 14 years (0.8 per 100,000). The suicide rate for males in the 15- to 19-year age group is markedly higher than that for females (Table 3). Rates differ by racial and ethnic group. African-American youth have lower suicide rates than Caucasian youth, with the lowest adolescent suicide rate being that of African-American females. The highest suicide rate is that of Native American males.Although many youth who report suicidal thoughts or attempt suicide do not become suicide victims, these categories overlap substantially. For instance, having frequent thoughts of suicide is the best predictor of suicide attempts, and most youth who attempt suicide report a history of suicidal ideation. Furthermore, greater severity of reported suicidal thoughts increases the likelihood of a suicide attempt within the next year. Approximately 35% to 45% of adolescents who complete suicide have a positive history of suicide attempt. The prevalences of both self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are higher for adolescent females than for adolescent males (Table 3).Risk factors for completed suicide and suicidal behavior are similar in most respects. There are a few exceptions, however, such as the more specific relationship between availability of firearms and completed suicide. In this section, we review the primary risk factors for completed suicide (Table 4).A history of prior suicidal behavior is the strongest predictor of future suicidal behavior. Nonlethal suicidal gestures or self-inflicted harm, which sometimes are thought to be manipulative or attention-seeking, should not be taken lightly. Youth often can be poor judges of lethality, and what is believed to be a gesture actually may be accompanied by significant suicidal intent. It also may result in substantial physical harm or even suicide because of an error in knowledge or judgment (eg, potential lethality of acetaminophen overdose).Approximately 80% of youth who attempt suicide and 90% of youth suicide victims have histories of identifiable psychiatric or mental disorders. The most common types of psychopathology in these youth are depressive disorders, alcohol or substance abuse, conduct disorder or patterns of aggressive behavior, and anxiety disorders. Increased suicide risk is associated with conditions that often are refractory to treatment or present management problems. These include BD, a chronic depressive disorder comorbid with alcohol or substance abuse, and psychotic presentations.Depressive disorders are linked with increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicides (Table 5). In fact, suicidal ideation and behavior are common and often unrelenting problems among youth who have depressive disorders. Eighty-five percent of depressed youth report significant suicidal ideation, and 32% of depressed youth report one or more suicide attempts prior to adulthood. Retrospective studies have found that about 50% of adolescent suicides involve the consumption of alcohol, which increases impulsivity, impaired judgment, and mood changes.Environmental or family stress, especially a history of neglect or physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, are considered significant risk factors for suicidal behavior. Interpersonal conflict and loss (eg, fights, break-ups, deaths) also are risk factors. Additionally, hopelessness, impulsivity, aggressive behavior, and agitation are psychological characteristics associated with increased risk for suicidal behavior.Gay, lesbian, and bisexual adolescents are at increased risk for suicidal behavior. Recent general population surveys indicate that approximately 42% of these youth experience suicidal ideation, and 28% have made one or more suicide attempts during the past year. Many of the risk factors in these youth are the same as those for heterosexual youth. Problems such as comorbid substance abuse and depression, however, are more common among youth who have a homosexual orientation. In addition, risk factors such as stigmatization and discrimination are specific to those who face negative attitudes within society.The risk for depression, anxiety, and suicide increases when a youth knows someone who commits suicide. In these situations, intervention aimed at promoting grief and mourning and decreasing guilt, trauma, and social isolation as well as providing psychoeducational counseling aimed at decreasing identification with the suicidal behavior are recommended. Media coverage of suicide may spark suicide contagion. Clinicians are encouraged to advise reporters whenever possible to reduce excessive coverage and to advise parents and educators to discourage exposure of youth to such coverage.Firearms are found more commonly in the homes of suicide victims than in the homes of other youth, including those of psychiatrically hospitalized suicidal youth. The importance of restricting suicidal youth's access to firearms is highlighted by documented associations between more restrictive gun control laws and decreases in suicide rates. Similarly, potentially lethal drugs (such as prescription or over-the-counter sedative drugs) either should be removed from the homes of potentially suicidal youth or monitored closely by parents and guardians.Evidence suggests that if asked directly, adolescents will reveal suicidal preoccupations and previous suicidal behavior. Direct questions should address whether children or adolescents wish they were not alive, if they ever have thought about or tried to hurt themselves intentionally, if they ever have thought about or tried to kill themselves, and if they have or had such a plan in mind. It is important to understand that asking an adolescent about suicidal thoughts or behaviors will not \"put such ideas into his or her head\" or increase the risk for suicidal behavior. Follow-up inquiry regarding the intensity, chronicity, specificity, and recency of such thoughts is advised. Standardized self-report questionnaires, such as the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, may permit the youth to answer without direct verbalization, which can facilitate honesty. If endorsed, critical items related to intent or planning and items suggesting significant suicidality (in terms of chronicity, severity, or frequency) always should be followed up with direct inquiry. Other sources of information include reports from parents, teachers, or others who may have heard suicidal statements or witnessed behaviors such as giving away prized possessions. As with the assessment of depressive disorders, a comprehensive evaluation that incorporates input from the youth and parent or guardian is essential.A psychiatric inpatient or partial hospitalization program may be necessary for patients found to be at elevated suicide risk. Hospital stays generally are brief and emphasize safety, stabilization, evaluation, and aftercare recommendations. Suicide attempts (or plans) that have significant lethality and that include efforts taken to avoid detection indicate serious intent as well as knowledge and planning and should be taken extremely seriously. Furthermore, attention to safety requires consideration of the child's home environment. Parents and caregivers should be advised to remove lethal agents, especially firearms and toxic medications, from the home. Self-injurious behaviors by young children should not be disregarded as accidental. For example, when a 6-year-old child ingests poisonous materials, it may not be accidental. Such behavior should be assessed carefully for associated mood or other disturbance.Verbal or written \"no suicide\" contracts are used in many settings. The patient is asked to agree not to attempt suicide. Furthermore, the patient is asked to agree to contact the clinician, parent, or other responsible adult if he or she feels a suicidal urge or experiences suicidal intent. Perspectives on these contracts have evolved over the past decade, with an increasing emphasis on using the contract as an assessment tool. The contract process may reveal current suicidal intent. It also provides information about the patient's ability to identify, and willingness to turn to, helpful adults. It is useful to review what positive coping steps the youth and parent would take in the event of a suicidal crisis. This offers an opportunity for problem-solving and can counter the tendency of some youth and families to minimize or deny the risk of suicidal behavior. It should be noted, however, that research does not support the conclusion that such contracts prevent suicide; they are not substitutes for comprehensive case management.When caring for a potentially suicidal youth, suicide risk factors, including suicidal thoughts, urges, and behaviors, are monitored at each session. Rules of thumb when working with suicidal youth include: 1) confirming next appointment times at each session, 2) following up on \"no-shows,\" and 3) providing information to the youth and parent or guardian about easily accessible 24-hour emergency services. Comprehensive case management includes psychoeducation and regular patient monitoring with guidelines for responding to crises/changes in functioning.The population of suicidal youth is heterogeneous in terms of primary psychiatric disorder(s), comorbid conditions, personality traits, the presence of complicating psychosocial issues, developmental level, and demographic characteristics. Therefore, the treatment should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of psychopathology and, more generally, suicide risk and protective factors.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

Despite being a common disorder at any age, in adults with a prevalence of up to 10%, is not diagnosed by doctors and first level specialists that is why diagnostic and therapeutic interventions get delayed contributing to the perpetuation of symptoms and worsening quality of life. Since its diagnosis is purely clinical, getting familiar with this disorder is essential to ensure proper focus and thus rule out other diseases commonly confused with this one. Restless legs syndrome has a multi-factorial etiology that ranges from a genetic and hereditary, which are called primary restless legs syndrome, to its association with multiple pathologies, known as secondary restless legs syndrome. As for its management, drug therapy and non-drug therapy is aimed at symptom control, as its cure is not possible, although occasionally the condition can refer to later repeat in months or years.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Occupational stress was perceived to be a problem only in jobs with high pressure and low pay, such as teaching and social services. Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

      "abstract": "The fatigue in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) appears to be more severe, more functionally impairing, and less likely to be alleviated by rest than fatigue commonly experienced by healthy individuals. The words used by individuals with CFS to describe their fatigue are characterized by terms that deal with functional limitations, frustration, loss of control, permanence, depression, and pervasiveness—language that clearly reflects their diminished quality of life (QOL). With respect to etiology, CFS has been conceptualized among a spectrum of stress-related, functional disorders characterized by profound fatigue and, frequently, pain. In terms of sleep characteristics, individuals with CFS display the characteristic signs of poor overall sleep efficiency that is typically seen in persons with insomnia. They frequently experience nonrestorative sleep, and their daytime functioning is also seriously compromised. QOL scores reflect findings which show that symptoms of CFS significantly undermine many facets of these individuals' lives and significantly impair physical and social functioning as well as participation in activities of daily living. Physicians have little to offer their patients who have CFS. Friends and family, also unable to help, often tell people who have CFS to \"just get on with your life,\" \"pull yourself together,\" and \"stop moping around.\" By dismissing and invalidating the lived experience of individuals with CFS, they contribute to an already poor QOL. Despite recent progress in understanding the biological mechanisms of the illness, more work needs to be done to find effective clinical treatments. Healthcare professionals and disability insurance carriers need to be informed that CFS is a real and disabling physical illness.",

      "abstract": "The use of steroids and supplements can complicate the clinical picture in a young man with mood swings, anxiety, and depression referred for psychiatric evaluation by his primary care clinician and a psychologist. Identifying information: A 20-year-old single man was referred by his primary care physician and a psychologist for medical management of mood swings, anxiety, and confusion. Chief complaint: The patient reported unremitting sadness that had lasted more than a year, and said that he generally felt dead inside or like a zombie. He was often ruminative and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. History of present illness: The young man's sadness and disagreeable sensations were relieved only for periods of 3 to 4 days when he felt more worried than sad. It was during these intervals of worry that he grew more ruminative, tired, and irritable, and said he could not sort out his thoughts. The patient could not recall when he last felt well enough to have fun with friends. He ruminated about the past, often trying to change it in his mind and thereby causing himself to become confused about what was real and what he might have imagined to be real. In particular, he was preoccupied with the recent loss of a relationship with a girl, which began in high school. He blamed the loss on his moodiness. However, he also acknowledged that he briefly dated her younger sister, a short time after which the girlfriend abruptly stopped returning his calls, telling him it was payback for dating her sister. The patient spent a great deal of time online looking at his ex-girlfriend's MySpace social-interaction page, which only caused him to feel worse. He blamed himself for everything that was wrong in his life and struggled with thoughts that people were talking and thinking about him negatively. Because he believed he was physically too small, he exercised regularly to stay in good shape. Medications and allergies: The referring primary care physician and psychologist had prescribed sertraline 100 mg/d for 3 weeks. They then switched him to venlafaxine 225 mg/d, which he took for 4 to 5 weeks. However, the patient stopped taking both drugs on his own initiative because they made him feel numb, and he also thought they made him feel more depressed. In the week before the initial psychiatric evaluation, his father had given him some sleeping medications because he was often tense, keyed up, and unable to relax in the evenings and around bedtime. They did not help. Otherwise, this young man had not been taking any medications during the previous 6 months. Psychiatric history: The patient had never been hospitalized and denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. As mentioned, he sometimes thought he could undo the past by some ritualistic rnental action. The young man was an only child and spent a lot of time talking about this. He denied any history of childhood trauma. However, he held an unusual suspicion that his parents were hiding a birth defect from him, and that this defect was in some manner related to his current issues and difficulties. He did not give any more details about this suspicion, saying, Every time I ask them about it, they tell me I'm crazy and just make a joke about it. His mother reported that it took about 10 years to conceive, but there were no complications with the pregnancy or delivery. The patient received no intervention during the first 6 months of the current episode, when his family doctor was contacted. The doctor referred the patient to a psychologist for counseling, and the psychologist quickly referred him back to the doctor, believing that the young man needed a prescription for antidepressant medication. His mother said he was drinking alcohol more regularly while on his medications, and that he was probably not fully compliant with the antidepressant regimens. He was never prescribed benzodiazepines for his anxiety and tension, apparently due to concern about abuse potential. …",

      "title": "Management of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "The patient is a 35-year-old married woman with an obsessive compulsive disorder. She had a 21-year history of obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors including compulsive checking which had become persistent since the birth of her first child. There is no evidence of comorbidity, except for a mild generalized anxiety disorder. She wants to know which treatment is right for her at this point.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common chronic, and disabling disorder characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive and distressing thoughts, images, or impulses. Compulsions are repetitive, intentional behaviors that the person feels compelled to perform, often with a desire to resist. Compulsions are typically intended to avert some fear event or to reduce distress. These symptoms are ego-dystonic and cause significant distress to patients and their families. OCD is among the most common anxiety disorders, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2.3% [1]. It is almost equally distributed between males and females.OCD often begins in adolescence or early adulthood usually with a gradual onset. However, a rapid onset of symptoms may occur, sometimes associated with a traumatic event, such as pregnancy or loss. Actually, recent literature suggests that pregnancy may precipitate OCD in individuals [2, 3], as in our case report. It appears that patients who reported the onset or worsening of OCD symptoms in pregnancy developed fear of harming the fetus or child [3, 4]. However, in our case report, the patient's preoccupations deal with responsibility for her child's health (e.g. 'my son will choke to death with his blanket if I don't check'): the patient does not fear being responsible for any harm coming to her son. Due to the secretive nature of the disorder, there is often a delay of more than 10 years before patients come to specialty settings [5]. The trouble is usually long, with most patients experiencing a chronic course, while others experience a fluctuating one [6].Patients with both obsessions and compulsions constitute a large proportion of affected patients. OCD can be expressed through many different symptoms. The classical presentation includes obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors of washing and/or checking. Another pattern is one with merely intrusive obsessional thoughts, without compulsion (table 1).OCD can be severely incapacitating: depression is the most common complication and the symptoms can spread to interfere with the patient's social and occupational functioning, often involving the entire family.The case report thus highlights a common clinical problem faced by clinicians, whether in primary care or psychiatric unit. The patient meets the criteria for OCD according the DSM-IV [7].Until the early 1970s, OCD was considered a treatment refractory, chronic situation. Neither psychodynamic therapy nor a variety of pharmacological treatments, available at that time, led to significant improvement. Today, substantial evidence suggests that behavior therapy is effective in treating this chronic disorder [8]. Furthermore, recent advances in pharmacotherapy have led to a significant reduction in suffering and a return to productive living for many patients with OCD [9]. OCD is currently treated with pharmacological and/or psychological approaches. Our patient refused any pharmacological treatment; thus we recommended psychotherapy (20 sessions).Among the best established treatments are behavioral therapy, particularly those involving exposure and response prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) involves the combination of behavior therapy (BT; exposure with response prevention, ERP) and cognitive therapy (CT). After more than a quarter century of research, ERP has become the gold standard to which other psychological treatments for OCD, such as CT, have been compared [10]. For CBT15–20 sessions are proposed for the treatment of an uncomplicated OCD patient. The format is individual weekly therapy sessions. A maintenance schedule is required (monthly booster sessions for 6–12 months).BT for OCD most specifically involves exposure and response or ritual prevention. The effectiveness of BT, in the form of ERP for OCD, has been demonstrated in controlled studies and meta-analyses [11, 12]. To date, the last meta-analysis [12]including 77 studies with 4,651 patients showed that BT was superior to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Exposure capitalizes on the fact that anxiety usually attenuates after a sufficient duration of contact with a feared stimulus. In order to achieve adequate exposure, it is usually necessary to help the patient block the rituals or avoidance behaviors, a process termed response or ritual prevention. In fact, the OCD patient is exposed to stimuli that provoke the obsessive response and helped to desist from avoidance and escape (compulsive) behavior. The rationale for treatment has to be outlined in the detail during the initial session for the patient and significant others, if present. This rationale uses a functional analysis to describe the patient's symptoms and to explain how the reduction of anxiety through compulsions maintains the behavior. It includes the theoretical and practical implications of ERP, focusing on the reduction of anxiety and rituals, and explains imaginary and in vivo exposure. Information gathering includes current OCD symptoms and general functioning, administration of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, course and history of OCD, previous treatment and response, general psychosocial and family history. Information gathering usually requires three sessions. Treatment planning has to be completed in the session preceding the first exposure session, focusing on the construction of a hierarchy (which includes items that the patient either currently avoids or performs only with rituals). The patient is asked to rate each item on a rating scale in which 0 indicates no anxiety and 100 indicates maximum anxiety. After the situations are ranked from lowest to highest anxiety rating, exposure therapy proceeds upward on the hierarchy, beginning with the lower-rated items to maximize compliance of the patient. The techniques which have to be used are therapist-aided ERP in imagination and/or in vivo, exposure in vivo with response prevention through homework and family intervention whenever the family is involved in rituals [13, 14]. The patients have to record homework completion. Behavioral homework is discussed and set with the therapist.To date less attention has been paid to CT, which may be added to ERP, to address such things as faulty estimation of danger or the exaggerated sense of personal responsibility often seen in OCD patients. The first step in CT for OCD consists of informing the patient that his/her intrusive thoughts are an abnormal phenomenon and provides him or her with a list of intrusive thoughts that commonly occur in the general population [15]. The patient learns that the difference between normal and dysfunctional intrusive thoughts lies in the significance attached to these thoughts. The interpretation of these intrusive thoughts made by people with obsession affects the occurrence and/or the content of these thoughts [16]. An important general cognitive technique used by the therapist to challenge the automatic thoughts is Socratic Dialogue [17]. The patient is encouraged to question the catastrophic significance of the intrusive thought and to construct alternative less catastrophic interpretations. Behavioral experiments are also commonly used to test the empirical basis of the patient's new interpretation in order to challenge or evaluate the beliefs. Two controlled trials compared CT based on Beck's model and ERP. Van Oppen et al. [10]demonstrated that CT was better than ERP at the post-test phase, but to date no follow-up of this study has been published. In a randomized controlled trial [18]CT and intensive BT were equally effective on OCD, but at post-test CT had specific effects on depression which were stronger than those of BT. Findings for the 1-year follow-up study are presently in preparation. The principal finding is that benefits are maintained and both treatments produced equivalent results: at week 26 and 52, improvement was retained in both groups without between-group difference. Cognitive measures of obsessions changed equally in the 2 groups.In our case, the first 3 sessions were assigned to the behavioral analysis, the therapeutic goals, and evaluation. We then started the CT from session 3 to 12. We first explained the OCD cognitive model to the patient, and then we taught her to point out and modify her automatic thoughts and cognitive biases. Automatic thoughts dealt with disasters and her responsibility for these ('if I haven't closed the window, someone will enter and take my son away'). During the 13th session, we started the behavioral therapy (ERP) for 8 sessions. After having explained the OCD behavioral model and the habituation principle to the patient, we set up a hierarchy in order to expose the patient (imaginary and in vivo exposure).The predominant hypothesis about OCD pathophysiology implicates abnormal serotonergic function regulation. Research clearly shows that the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the only effective treatments for OCD. These medications increase the concentration of serotonin. Six SRIs are currently available: clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram. Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram are SSRIs because they primarily affect only serotonin. Clomipramine is a nonselective SRI: it affects many other neurotransmitters besides serotonin.In most cases, treatment should be initiated with a SSRI because of the superior safety tolerability, and equivalent efficacy of this class of drug compared with clomipramine [19]. Actually, there have been relatively few comparative studies between the SSRIs in the treatment of OCD [20, 21, 22]. The studies comparing SSRI and clomipramine have shown that they all demonstrated efficacy [23, 24]. However, clomipramine is also associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. In a flexible dose trial of paroxetine compared with clomipramine in 406 patients with OCD [26], paroxetine and clomipramine were more effective than placebo. In terms of efficacy, no significant difference between paroxetine and clomipramine were noted beginning at week 6, and the response was nearly equivalent at week 12. However, significantly more patients treated with clomipramine withdrew from the study because of adverse effects. In a review of the efficacy of SRIs in OCD [30], the authors reported that SSRIs possess efficacy similar to that of clomipramine, but have a superior side effect profile. This suggestion may have important implications for patients with OCD who require long-term treatment. In a multicenter meta-analysis [31]placebo-controlled trials found clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline to be superior to placebo. These authors also found that the 3 SSRIs were comparable to each other in efficacy and that clomipramine was more effective than the SSRIs. Stein et al. [32]presented a meta-analysis of pharmacotherapy trials for OCD. In placebo-controlled trials, SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) had a significant effect on medication effect size with clomipramine more effective than fluoxetine. Another meta- analytic review of the efficacy of drug treatments [33]found that SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) are effective in short-term treatments for patients suffering from OCD; although the increase in improvement rate over placebo was greater for clomipramine than for SSRIs, direct comparison between these drugs showed that they had similar therapeutic efficacy on obsessive-compulsive symptoms; concomitant high levels of depression at the outset did not seem necessary for clomipramine and for SSRIs to improve obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In a meta-analysis comparing pharmacological treatments of OCD (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline) [34], clomipramine was not significantly better than fluoxetine or fluvoxamine; no significant difference was found between clomipramine and the other SRIs as a group in head to head trials; furthermore, no difference in drop-out rates was found. Clomipramine stands out from the other SRIs. The authors conclude that this difference is probably not clinically significant enough to warrant first choice treatment, given clomipramine's greater lethality in overdose.The backbone of pharmacological treatment for OCD is a 10- to 12- week trial with clomipramine or a SSRI in adequate doses before initiating alternative therapy. Actually, OCD appears to respond in a time interval of approximately 8–12 weeks. Clinical experience suggests the necessity of long-term, and in some case lifelong treatment. As far as pharmacologic treatment is concerned, a drug treatment should last at least 2 years after the remission of symptoms before considering medication withdrawal. This is motivated by the fact that preliminary evidence suggests that relapses after discontinuation of the drug are associated with increased resistance of treatment [35]. If the patient does not respond to an average dose of SSRI, the experts [36]recommend gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 4–8 weeks from the start of the treatment. When a patient is having a partial response to an average dose of SSRI, the experts suggest gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 5–9 weeks from the start of the treatment. They consider 8–13 weeks an adequate medication trial before changing medication or augmenting with another agent.Despite these significant advances in pharmacological treatment with SSRIs and clomipramine, as many as 40–60% of OCD patients are clinically unchanged after an adequate trial with these agents [37].Simos [38]reported that the efficacy of combined BT and pharmacotherapy for OCD is controversial. In a review of relevant studies, Steketee [39]concluded that this combination has shown little advantage over BT alone. Preliminary findings from a trial by Kozak et al. [40]also supported this conclusion. However, some controlled studies combining BT with antidepressants showed a better outcome on rituals and depression in the long term. In particular, Cottraux et al. [41]showed that SSRI + BT compared to placebo + BT gives better results at 3 months on rituals and at 6 months on depression with equivalent results at 12 and 18 months. Moreover, a more recent but small sample study comparing CBT and medication in the treatment of OCD provided evidence in favor of the combination [42]. OCD patients received 1 of 4 treatments: medication and CBT simultaneously; CBT only; medication while on a waiting list for CBT, or no treatment while on a waiting list for CBT. Multivariate analyses revealed that the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and clinical ratings significantly improved after treatment in all groups except the non-treatment, waiting list, control group. Subjects in the 2 treatment groups receiving CBT showed reduced strength in their obsessional beliefs. The subsequent administration of CBT to those groups on the waiting list also decreased the strength of their primary obsessional beliefs and beliefs about the consequences of not performing the rituals. Results of this small sample study suggest that either CBT or medication alone is more effective than no treatment. The combination seems to potentiate treatment efficacy, and, according to the authors, it is more clinically beneficial to introduce CBT after a period of medication rather than to start both therapies simultaneously. This study is limited by the small number of subjects per condition (5–9 maximum), the duration of the treatment (5 months), and the absence of follow-up.Initial management of OCD relies on potent SRIs and CBT, used separately, sequentially or concurrently. 90% of patients can be helped with one or combination of these therapies [43].Unfortunately some patients do not respond adequately or at all to the initial treatment plan of CBT or SSRI or a combination of the two. The experts [36]recommend adding an SSRI when patients have not responded well to CBT alone. When patients have not done well with medication management alone, the experts suggest either adding CBT or switching to another SSRI. Thus, combined CBT and medication is the experts' preference for most patients who have not responded to an initial trial of either CBT or medication alone. In patients who have shown no response to combined treatment, the experts recommend switching SSRIs and continuing CBT. In patients with a partial response to combination therapy, they suggest switching SSRIs, providing more CBT, and possibly augmenting with another medication.Some patients are treatment-refractory, defined by the experts [36]as those who fail to respond to 3 sequential well-delivered SRI trials combined with expert CBT. A thorough clinical assessment of patients with treatment-refractory OCD is the first step in planning possible intervention. All DSM-IV axes should be thoroughly evaluated. These aspects include assessment of complications: Axis I (e.g., comorbid disorders); Axis II (e.g., personality disorders); Axis III (e.g., underlying medical disorder), and Axis IV (e.g., psychosocial stressors). In addition, the OCD symptoms themselves should be carefully assessed. Actually, there is some evidence that hoarding is more likely than other OCD symptoms to fail to respond to treatment [44, 45].There are a growing number of management options, including both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy augmentation, and alternative interventions for treatment-refractory OCD patients. The literature has somewhat less agreement about what to do in managing treatment-refractory patients. First-line recommendations are to add an augmenting medication, especially if the patient exhibits associated features (e.g., tics or a comorbid anxiety disorder) that might predict a positive response to augmentation. For example, it may be helpful to add an anxiety-reducing medication, such as clonazepam or alprazolam, in patients with high levels of anxiety; a high potency neuroleptic, such as haloperidol or risperidone, when tics or comorbid schizotypy are present. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting (e.g., using a partial hospital or inpatient behavioral unit to conduct therapist-assisted ERP), technique, intensity (additional CBT sessions or intensive CBT), or format (family or group therapy), or to switch to another SRI or a monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Pharmacotherapy augmentation included augmentation with serotoningeric agents, dopaminergic agents, and various other agents as well as alternative forms (e.g., increased doses) or routes (e.g., intravenous administration) of SRI administration.There are a variety of psychological factors, such as low motivation, negative expectancies for treatment success, procrastination, and noncompliance, that may interfere with response to ERP. In these cases, the cognitive component of OCD should be addressed more directly [46]. Obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions were studied as predictors of compliance with and response to BT in a controlled trial [47]. High scores on the hoarding dimension were more likely to dropout prematurely from the study and tend to improve less. BT is specially indicated for OCD patients with aggressive/checking, contamination/cleaning and symmetry/ordering symptoms. OCD patients with comorbid personality disorder should be treated by integrative CT [48].To better understand the causes of obsessions and compulsions, further work needs to be done to identify cognitive domains (beliefs and appraisals) that are specific to OCD. Some of the beliefs and appraisals identified by the Obsessive Compulsive Working Group [49]may be nonspecific, playing a role in obsessions, compulsions, and in many other clinical problems such as depression and generalized anxiety. Further work also needs to be done to identify the causes of important beliefs and appraisals. Advances in understanding OCD are more likely to occur if we can integrate the various methods of assessment [50]. There are also several challenges to be met in the area of OC spectrum disorders. First, the boundaries of the OC spectrum need to be better defined. More systematic research is needed on the relationship between OCD and various spectrum disorders, especially with respect to etiology, treatment response, and other theoretical important features [51]. Notwithstanding the growing evidence for the efficacy of CT or CBT in treating OCD, there is still little evidence that cognitive components of treatment add to the effectiveness of behavioral therapy [18, 52]. Perhaps we do not yet know enough about cognition in OCD, especially how to measure and modify them. A number of researchers have demonstrated that CBT produces a change in measures of beliefs considered relevant and/or specific to OCD. However, these studies are preliminary at this point, but nonetheless promising [53].The development of new models of OCD should help to understand and improve actual treatments, such as the model of perceived impulsivity and compensatory compulsivity [54].The experts [36]usually prefer to begin the treatment of OCD with either CBT alone or with a combination of CBT and medication. The likelihood that medication will be included in the recommendation varies with the severity of the OCD and the age of the patient. In milder OCD, CBT alone is the initial choice. As severity increased, the experts are more likely to add medications to CBT as the initial treatment or to use medication alone. In younger patients, the experts are more likely to use CBT alone. The experts consider the combination of ERP as the optimal behavioral psychotherapy for OCD, while CT may provide additional benefit by directly targeting distorted 'OCD beliefs' and/or by improving compliance with ERP.In managing treatment-refractory patients, the experts suggest a variety of augmentation strategies that can be tried in OCD, including clomipramine, clonazepam, conventional neuroleptics, buspirone, risperidone, and a second SSRI added to the first. The choice of augmentation medications would have to be tailor made for each patient. Clomipramine may be useful in boosting the response of a patient treated with an SSRI who is not having an adequate response. Neuroleptics may be helpful for patients who have not had an adequate response to an SRI and who have a comorbid tic disorder, OCD symptoms such as compulsive touching that resembles tics, or a comorbid schizotypy. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting, technique, or intensity, or to switch to another SRI or an MAOI. Finally, in patients with extremely severe and non-remitting OCD, intravenous clomipramine, neurosurgery, or electro-convulsive therapy (if the patient is also depressed) may sometimes be considered.The case illustrated in here represents a typical obsessive compulsive patient. We offered her a CBT effective in 20 sessions. The Yates-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score dropped from 29 at the beginning of therapy to 13 at the end of the treatment. This decrease represents a 55% efficacy. Results were stable for the 1-year follow-up. The overall strategies for treatment of OCD are presented in figure 1. On the basis of the evidence available, the following approach is outlined.The first step in treating OCD is educating the patient and family about OCD and its treatment as a medical illness. During the last 20 years, two effective treatments have been developed: CBT and medication with a SSRI. Education is crucial in helping the patients and their families learn how to best manage OCD and prevent complications. CBT is the key element of treatment for most patients with OCD. Medication with SSRI is helpful for many patients, especially for patients with depression. The BT (ERP) involved systematic exposure to the obsessions as well as prevention of any compulsive or neutralizing behaviors that might be used to reduce anxiety. ERP did prove to be a very successful form of treatment for OCD, especially for those with washing and, to a lesser extent, checking rituals. Outcome studies of ERP indicate that approximated 70–80% of OCD patients who complete treatment show significant symptom improvement [55]. CT, which may be added to BT, addresses such dysfunctional beliefs as faulty estimation of the importance of thoughts, exaggerated sense of personal responsibility and perfectionism often seen in OCD patients. CT may also provide additional benefits by improving compliance with ERP. CT may also be of value for the substantial number of refusers and potential drop-outs of BT. Because of well-proven efficacy and safety profiles, the SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy for the management of patients with OCD. Patients who initially do not respond to SSRI therapy may benefit from switching to another SSRI or combining another medication or CBT with SSRI. There is evidence that addition of a neuroleptic may improve response to SSRI in some patients.Once OCD symptoms are eliminated or much reduced – a goal which is practical for the majority of those with OCD – then maintenance of treatment gains becomes the goal. When patients have completed a successful course of treatment for OCD, most experts recommend monthly follow-up visits for at least 6 months and continued treatment for at least 2 years before trying to stop medication or CBT. Relapse is very common when medication is withdrawn, particularly if the person has not felt the benefit of CBT. Therefore, many experts recommend continuing medication if the patients do not have access to CBT. Individuals with repeated episodes of OCD may need to receive long-term or even life-long prophylactic medication. The experts recommend such long-term treatment after 2–4 severe relapses or 3–4 milder relapses.The efficacy, acceptance and cost-effectiveness of short-term interventions for patients with OCD should certainly be further improved. The identification of factors which predict treatment response is a major goal. To effectively address the needs of individuals with severe and refractory OCD, current treatment strategies may need to be modified and supplemented. A promising area of research is the role of cognitive factors in OCD. Only the reports by Sookman and Pinard [48]have specifically examined the use of cognitive intervention with a difficult-to-treat sample of OCD patients. The apparent success of their cognitive treatment suggests that cognitive mechanisms could be involved in determining the severity or resilience of OCD. However, firm conclusions regarding the specific effects on cognitive intervention on severe or refractory OCD must await controlled studies.The authors wish to thank Emilie Aurouer for the English translation.'Case management' is a section which addresses biopsychosocial management of cases in clinical medicine.

      "abstract": "Mood disorders are characterized by abnormalities of mood and affect regulation, cognitive changes, motor activity alterations, sleep abnormalities, appetite changes, and other disturbances of homeostatic/drive states (e.g., libido, motivation). Although the etiology of mood disorders in most patients is \"idiopathic,\" neuropsychiatric disorders are commonly associated with disturbances of mood and affect, especially depressive syndromes. A growing literature supports a similar neurobiological basis for mood disorders, regardless of etiology. However, rather than defining a single causative \"lesion\" or neurochemical abnormality, current models propose an integrated set of distinct but interconnected neural systems underlying the phenomenological features of mood disorders. Each of these systems may be more or less disturbed, resulting in variable symptomatic presentation and treatment response. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], and bipolar disorder) are a pervasive and costly public health concern. Mood disorders have a 12-month prevalence rate of about 10% and a lifetime prevalence rate of about 20%. Mental and behavioral disorders, especially major depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability in the United States and present a significant economic burden nationally and globally. Current and developing mood disorder treatments are based on the complex interplay of anatomy, biochemistry, and phenomenology of mood disorders. By analogy, the treatments for many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), vary depending on the paradigm on which an intervention is based, such as biochemistry (e.g., dopamine agonists, enzyme inhibitors, anticholinergic medication), anatomy, or neurocircuitry (e.g., ablation, deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Similarly, greater acknowledgment of the intricate neurobiology of mood disorders will likely generate many diverse and hopefully effective treatments.",

      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a neuropsychological disorder, under the class of anxiety disorders characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worrying for six or more months. GAD is a major hurdle for personal and social productivity and a financial burden on governmental health sectors; moreover, it is one of the common mental health problems in Saudi Arabia and globally with physical and psychological manifestations (e.g., muscle tension, sleeplessness, disoriented thoughts, etc.). Although, there is not a mono-factor’s direct causality of pathogenesis, there are multiple risk factors such as genetics, socioeconomic status, and life experiences that may contribute to the development of GAD. Nonetheless, the diagnosis is made using the criteria set by the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) or the international classification of diseases 11th revision (ICD-11), which covers the patient’s past medical history and present social and environmental setting. The management of GAD includes a combination of psychiatric interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) and different medications (e.g., selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors) requiring thorough investigations and deep discussions with the patient to rule out other psychiatric conditions and to reach an optimal level of healthcare, preventing further deterioration. This article addresses the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of GAD in Saudi Arabia to present an integrated and updated review.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A common denominator in psychosomatically induced death is stress. Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

It spikes in adolescence, interrupts psychosocial development and functioning, and often co-occurs with mental health problems. Chronic pain often begins spontaneously without prior injuries and/or other disorders. Prospective longitudinal cohort studies following children from early childhood, prior to chronic pain onset, are needed to examine contributing factors, such as early pain experiences and mental health. Using data from a longitudinal community pregnancy cohort (All Our Families; AOF), the present study examined the associations between early developmental risk factors, including early childhood pain experiences and mental health symptoms, and the onset of pediatric chronic pain at ages 8 and 11 years.",

      "abstract": "Similarly as nearly all processes taking place continuously in the organism pain shows also frequently a circadian rhythm. In 30 patients with ischalgia pain intensity was studied over 24-hour periods during 7 successive days. The patients noted graphically the intensity of pain on a specially prepared scale. In the light of the data obtained from the patients three types of circadian pain rhythm curves were isolated. In 83,3% of cases the co urse of pain had an evident circadian rhythm returning during successive days. In 19 cases (63.3%) pain was particularly increased in the evening and night hours. In 6 cases (20%) the peak intensity of pain was in the morning hours (5-10 a.m.). In the remaining 5 cases (16%) its intensity was unchanged, without any circadian fluctuations. No relationship was demonstrated between pain rhythm and the age, sex, disease duration, spinal radiological changes, sensory or motor deficit. Pain rhythm is individual feature connected, probably, with other rhythmic processes in the organism, particularly with the rhythm of corticosteroid or endorphin release. Increased intensity of pain may be connected with falling level of these substances in the organism. In 35 patients with a significant nocturnal rhythm of ischalgic pain a trial was undertaken of treating the pain with dexomethasone administered in the evening hours in the painless period. The doses were 1-2 mg. In nearly 70% of cases (24 patients) a good effect of this treatment was obtained. This work based exclusively on clinical observations requires further studies and it is regarded by the authors as a preliminary communication.",

      "title": "CURRENT TRENDS IN MILITARY NEUROPSYCHIATRY",
      "abstract": "In pursuing these policies of prevention and treatment, many difficulties remain. Perhaps the most outstanding is the widespread misconception regarding the whole subject of mental health in the mind not only of military personnel but of the civilian public, the family back home, and the public press. It is generally recognized that the concept of physical health covers a wide range of conditions ranging from a light head cold on down to terminal lobar pneumonia. Mental health, on the other hand, has been regarded as being black or white. Either a man was insane or he was completely normal. The possibility has not been considered that there might be anything in between. Actually, of course, mental health just as physical health ranges all the way from bad to good. A man may have minor temporary mental ill health just as he may have a head cold. Mental disorders may be acute or chronic, severe or mild; just as a man may have simultaneously a broken leg and the grippe he may have an acute anxiety neurosis superimposed on a psychopathic personality or an organic condition. A great deal of the confusion has arisen on the basis of terminology and semantics. Any word beginning with the letters \"psy,\" to the average mind, suggests something mysterious and alarming: insanity, perversion, homicidal tendencies. Many laymen become frightened and resentful when a psychiatrist applies a medical term to conditions they were used to recognizing as a \"case of the jitters\" or \"gone stale\" or \"nervousness.\" It is difficult for laymen to realize that when a case of the jitters is sufficiently serious to incapacitate a man or produce insomnia and indigestion, a psychiatrist may call it pstchoneurosis and yet not mean anything more serious than was meant by the layman who called it the jitters. Actually, of course, the problem extends further than this. The question arises whether present psychiatric terminology was designed to cover the entire range of mental health. Is it perhaps necessary to devise a new set of diagnostic terms to cover the range of acute transitory psychiatric disturbances which occur in \"normal\" individuals in reaction to abnormal stress? In conclusion, it may be said that the problems of mental health in this war have presented a major challenge to psychiatrists. To meet this challenge it was necessary to revise concepts and to approach problems with new viewpoints—it was necessary to shift attention from problems of the abnormal mind in normal times to problems of the normal mind in abnormal times.",

      "title": "Symptomatic therapy in multiple sclerosis: Big pharma should do more—YES",
      "abstract": "1Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a wide variety of clinical phenotypes. This can range from asymptomatic to relapsing–remitting to progressive disease phases as well as an overlapping period in between each of these phases. Each phase can further be classified as being active or not active. 1 It is well known that patients may remain in each type indefinitely or for a variable period before progressing to the next clinical phenotype. Patients may develop residual neurological deficits either from the very beginning or later at any time during the course of the disease. Although a benign course may be seen in up to one-quarter of patients, even these may have some mild motor or sensory symptoms that may cause some discomfort, fatigue that may interfere with their daily living activities or cognitive changes leading to some limitations in their professional life. Most MS patients will end up having some residual neurological symptoms. Although the residual symptoms correlate with some disability steps in MS, this may not always be the case. For example, people without significant motor findings may also have other symptoms that, once properly managed, will ease that individual’s life. However, despite the large proportion of patients affected with a wide variety of neurologic symptoms, the number of available symptomatic treatments is limited and they are only partially effective. It is clear that some of these MS-related symptoms are not MS specific and may be seen as a result of other neurological (and non-neurological) disorders resulting in a much larger patient population that requires such therapies. Regarding the available symptomatic therapies and their efficacies, it becomes clear that this is a neglected area with a high need of new therapies. The emphasis in MS has almost always been on large trials to slow or eliminate the disability worsening by eliminating relapses or shortening the time to recovery after relapses. However, many patients still have residual symptoms after a relapse and continue to develop progressive symptoms despite the available treatments. Currently, there are 12 approved disease-modifying long-term therapies in MS; some others are expected to be approved soon and many more are in clinical trials. However, none offers a cure, but rather reduce clinical relapses and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) burden to a certain extent, with a less pronounced effect on long-term disability. These therapies continue to be effective in responders as long as they are used, but in some their efficacy may wear off over time. The higherefficacy disease-modifying therapies are also associated with more serious adverse events. So, it is clear that new treatments are needed for better long-term management of a progressive disease such as MS. The good news is that there are a large number of ongoing trials in this area, most sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.",

Severe depressive states (e.g. major depressive episodes) are less common than minor depressive states. Risk factors include female sex, lesser educational attainment, unemployment, and medical and psychiatric comorbidity. Potential critical illness/intensive care-related risk factors include severity of organ failure, high-dose benzodiazepine administration, longer ICU stays, stressful ICU experiences, and early post-intensive care distress. Depressive symptoms in survivors are associated with impaired physical function, other psychiatric morbidity, cognitive and work difficulties, and lower health-related quality of life.

Common themes in these qualitative data were episodes of infection, “doing too much” and stressful circumstances; in two-thirds of cases, accounts encompassed physical, behavioural and psychological factors. Patients described a gradual, sharp or phased onset, the latter involving a sharp onset but with a short term lifting of symptoms before worsening into chronic illness. A gradual onset was associated with longer duration of illness. Particular themes played a different role in patients' accounts, depending upon onset pattern. With a sharp or phased onset the most common perceived bigger for the abrupt change in health status was an episode of infection, but preceding factors were often invoked to explain the effect that this had had. With a phased onset, subsequent compounding factors (typically overdoing things) were similarly cited to explain worsening and the long term effect of the trigger. Thus, patients provided complex and dynamic accounts of illness onset, incorporating interacting factors. Key Words: Chronic fatigue syndromeonsetattributions",

      "title": "A relación entre las experiencias de apego, las estrategias emocionales y la aparición de sintomatología somática en adolescentes y jóvenes adultos",
      "abstract": "Los trastornos por sintomas somaticos representan uno de los problemas psicologicos mas relevantes en atencion primaria, con una gran repercusion a nivel medico y una alta demanda de tratamiento. Asimismo, la sintomatologia somatica constituye un fenomeno con enormes costes tanto a nivel individual o familiar como economico. Segun algunos estudios su coste medico supone el 10% del gasto sanitario total de cualquier pais desarrollado. Ademas, debido a la alta comorbilidad que la somatizacion y la presencia de sintomatologia somatica muestran con trastornos tan prevalentes hoy en dia como la depresion y la ansiedad, esta empezando a resultar un desafio clinico, que deja en evidencia la necesidad de estudiar los factores que rodean a este proceso y las causas que lo desencadenan. La adolescencia es un periodo clave para el estudio de la sintomatologia somatica, debido a las altas tasas de prevalencia que se encuentran en esta etapa del ciclo vital. La adolescencia y el inicio de la edad adulta son epocas caracterizadas por grandes cambios a nivel fisico y psicologico, cambios que tienen efectos directamente relacionados con un aumento de la sintomatologia somatica, de ahi la mayor prevalencia en comparacion con otras etapas vitales, y de ahi el interes que genera estudiar la sintomatologia somatica en poblacion adolescente. Cabe destacar ademas, que la mayoria de estudios han sido llevados a cabo en muestra infantil o adulta, y que los adolescentes han recibido menor atencion. La presente investigacion tiene por lo tanto como fin abordar los aspectos etiologicos de la sintomatologia somatica en la adolescencia y adultez emergente, y esclarecer las cuestiones que aun quedan inconclusas en la literatura. Cuenta para ello, con una parte teorica que consta de cuatro capitulos; una parte empirica, donde se aclaran los objetivos y las hipotesis de las que se parte, y se presentan los dos estudios realizados; y un apartado final de conclusiones y limitaciones. Al final del trabajo, se pueden encontrar los diferentes anexos a los que se hace alusion a lo largo del mismo. A lo largo del presente trabajo se ha decidido utilizar el genero masculino en terminos como “el nino”, “el adolescente”, “el adulto” o “el individuo” como generico y neutro para referirse tanto a los hombres como a las mujeres, con el unico fin de facilitar la lectura. Esta decision no implica ninguna preferencia o inclinacion por el sexo masculino, ni pretende discriminar al sexo femenino. Tampoco muestra una prevalencia mayor de los hombres respecto a las mujeres. En el primer capitulo, se introduce el tema de la sintomatologia somatica. Se describe su estudio, desde sus inicios hasta el dia de hoy, en que consiste el sintoma somatico y los trastornos por sintomas somaticos, y como se diagnostican, asi como los datos de prevalencia y comorbilidad. En respuesta a la problematica que representa la presencia de sintomatologia somatica, diversas orientaciones teoricas han propuesto numerosos modelos con el fin de explicar y dar cuenta de la etiologia que rodea al fenomeno de la somatizacion. Desde los modelos biologicos a los psicodinamicos, este proceso es visto y explicado de diversas maneras. La conceptualizacion mas extendida, entiende los sintomas somaticos como respuestas fisiologicas a conflictos psicologicos y sobre todo emocionales que no han podido ser expresadas de otra manera, y que quedan por lo tanto contenidas en el cuerpo. El presente estudio pretende abordar estos aspectos en poblacion adolescente y joven adulta, con el fin de esclarecer las cuestiones que aun quedan inconclusas en la literatura. En el segundo capitulo se ahonda en el desarrollo de las estrategias emocionales. Son precisamente estas estrategias las que facilitan o dificultan que la emocion sea debidamente expresada, y no quede estancada en el cuerpo, lo que facilitaria que posteriormente fuera expresada mediante los sintomas somaticos. Desde un acercamiento emocional, se entiende que cuando las emociones o impulsos son reprimidos, restringidos o bloqueados, y no encuentran una forma de expresion, pueden llegar a convertirse en sintomas somaticos o enfermedades fisicas como via de escape. Existen diversas teorias, modelos y puntos de vista sobre el funcionamiento y la clasificacion de estas estrategias. Se analizaran aquellas mas relevantes a la vez que se mostraran las diferencias individuales en cuanto a edad, sexo y desarrollo de dichas estrategias emocionales. Como ultimo capitulo teorico, se revisa la importancia de las relaciones tempranas en el desarrollo del funcionamiento emocional del nino y el adolescente, asi como en el proceso de somatizacion, desde el marco de la teoria del apego. Se analizan los diferentes estilos de apego propuestos a lo largo de los ultimos anos, y su relacion con el bienestar fisico y psicologico, y tambien los modelos internos de trabajo y las estrategias de apego que de ellos se derivan. Concretamente, en el presente estudio se entiende el apego como el vinculo mediante el cual el menor aprende a autorregular sus emociones, y por lo tanto como vinculo que condicionara las estrategias de regulacion emocional que el menor vaya a desarrollar. Dependiendo de las caracteristicas del carino y el cuidado ofrecido por las figuras de referencia, el vinculo que el menor cree con estas variara, asi como los esquemas y representaciones de si mismo y el mundo que le rodea, lo que tendra una importante influencia en su posterior desarrollo fisico y psicologico. Tambien se hace alusion al estudio del apego en adolescentes y jovenes adultos, y a la importancia que el grupo de iguales adquiere en esta etapa del ciclo vital. Cerrando la parte teorica, el cuarto capitulo recoge las diversas conclusiones que se extraen de la revision teorica y que justifican la realizacion de este estudio. Posteriormente y enmarcado en una parte mas empirica, se explican los objetivos e hipotesis planteados, que daran pie a los dos estudios empiricos de los que consta la presente investigacion, cada uno con su propio apartado de objetivos, metodologia, resultados y discusion. El primer estudio se dirige a validar el Emotional Processing Questionnaire, en lengua castellana, con poblacion adolescente y joven adulta. Este primer estudio se presenta en el sexto capitulo. En el mismo toman parte 600 estudiantes de entre 16 y 22 anos, que rellenan las diferentes medidas necesarias para llevar acabo el estudio. En cuanto a los resultados del mismo, mediante un analisis factorial confirmatorio, y teniendo en cuenta los diferentes indices de ajuste, se propone una nueva estructura factorial basada en un modelo de 3 factores de segundo orden. Asimismo, observando los diferentes indices psicometricos de fiabilidad y validez se concluye que el Emotional Processing Questionnaire en su validacion al castellano es una prueba objetiva, valida y fiable para medir las dificultades en el procesamiento emocional. Un segundo estudio, que conforma el septimo capitulo, explora las complejas relaciones entre las tres variables: la sintomatologia somatica, las estrategias emocionales, y las relaciones de apego; teniendo en cuenta la influencia que la edad y el sexo de la muestra puedan generar. Por un lado, se evaluan las diferencias y las similitudes entre hombres y mujeres y entre adolescentes y jovenes adultos respecto a las variables de estudio. Tambien se analizan las diferentes puntuaciones en el uso de estrategias emocionales y en la seguridad e el apego dependiendo de la presencia o ausencia de sintomatologia somatica. Asimismo, se tienen en cuenta los diferentes tipos de apego (seguro, ambivalente y evitativo) y las diferencias que puedan generar en las variables somaticas y emocionales. Por ultimo, se plantea un modelo de mediacion, donde las estrategias emocionales actuan como mediadoras en la relacion entre el apego y la sintomatologia somatica. Este modelo es significativo en el caso del apego materno y del apego paterno, pero no en el apego hacia el grupo de iguales. En primer lugar se presenta en que consiste el analisis de mediacion asi como las correlaciones entre todas las variables. Mas adelante, se muestran estos modelos mediacionales de forma grafica, analizandolos uno por uno, para al final poder discutir de forma amplia los resultados encontrados. Como cierre del estudio, se presentan las conclusiones generales de los estudios realizados y de los datos obtenidos, referentes a toda la tesis. Estas conclusiones ponen de manifiesto la importancia de las estrategias emocionales en el proceso de somatizacion y de aparicion del sintoma somatico, teniendo en cuenta la edad y el sexo de la muestra. Ademas, resaltan su relacion con los vinculos de apego y con las experiencias tempranas con las figuras de referencia, como es el caso de la madre y del padre; y ofrecen evidencia a favor del papel mediador de estas estrategias en la relacion entre el apego y la sintomatologia somatica. De estas conclusiones finales se derivan futuras lineas de investigacion, aludiendo a las limitaciones con las que se ha encontrado el presente estudio. Asmismo, tambien se hace especial hincapie en las implicaciones practicas y clinicas que se pueden desprender de esta tesis.",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis remains a chronic disease with lesions that are often extensive and disfiguring. While the potential for psychosocial morbidity and impairment are recognized, the literature remains equivocal with regard to the prevalence and degree of this impairment.The present study utilized a new questionnaire designed to assess the type and degree of psychosocial impairment present among psoriasis patients. The questionnaire was designed to assess major areas of psychosocial functioning and was completed by 64 patients undergoing outpatient treatment.Approximately half the patients were found to have moderate to extreme levels of anxiety, depression, and anger. Patients reported experiencing these negative emotional sequelae both during their disease flares and during periods of remission. Patients were also found to have moderate to extreme levels of pruritus associated with their flares. Psychologic morbidity was positively associated with length of disease flare. Significant levels of social embarrassment, life disruption, and social withdrawal were found as well.Psoriasis does appear to cause significant psychosocial morbidity. Greater awareness by physicians and more comprehensive treatment addressing these psychosocial components may avert, or at least minimize, some of these negative sequelae.",

      "abstract": "- In 2002 S. Leiblum describes and documents a new female sexual dysfunction, called Persistent Sexual Arousal Disorder (PSAD). The dysfunction is characterized by an excitement that persists for prolonged periods, such as hours, days or weeks. The excitement is not linked to sexual desire and may also be triggered by non sexual stimuli, as mere vibrations; moreover it cannot find a way out in an orgasm, which often proves unsatisfactory. Causes that may contribute to increase female sexual activity, be it egosyntonic or egodistonic, pleasant or disturbing for the couple, are still not appropriately investigated (Leiblum, Graziottin, 2007).",

      "title": "ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

      "title": "A possible link between circadian rhythm disorders and mood disorders",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm disorders are problems with your circadian rhythm, the internal body that keeps your biological processes in step. This cycle lasts about 24 hours. The term circadian comes from Latin words that mean “around the day.” Patterns of brain waves, hormone production, cell regrowth, and other activities are linked to this cycle. Your circadian rhythm plays a key role in things like when you sleep and when you wake. Your normal circadian clock is set by the cycle of light and dark over 24 hours. People with circadian rhythm disorders may have problems: Falling asleep, Staying asleep, Waking up too early and not being able to go back to sleep, Getting sleep but not feeling refreshed by it. Things that can cause circadian rhythm disorders include Shift work, Pregnancy, Time zone changes, Medications, Changes in routine, such as staying up late or sleeping in, Medical problems including Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, Mental health problems, Menopause. Various Circadian Rhythm Disorders include Jet lag, or rapid time zone change syndrome: This involves symptoms like too much sleepiness and a lack of daytime alertness in people who travel across time zones. It gets worse with each time zone crossed, especially when traveling toward the east. Shift work sleep disorder: This sleep disorder affects people who frequently rotate shifts or work at night. A conflict between someone’s circadian rhythm and the time of their shift can mean they get up to 4 hours less sleep than the average person. Delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS): This is a disorder of sleep timing. People with DSPS tend to fall asleep very late at night and have a hard time waking up in time for work, school, or social activities. It’s especially common in teens and young adults. Advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS): This is a disorder in which a person goes to sleep earlier and wakes earlier than they wanted. For example, they might fall asleep between 6 and 9 p.m. and wake up between 1 and 5 a.m. Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder: This disorder often affects people who are blind because the circadian clock is set by the light-dark cycle. With this condition, that cycle is disturbed. It can cause a serious lack of sleep time and quality at night and sleepiness during daylight hours. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder: With this disorder, people’s circadian rhythms are jumbled. They may sleep in a series of naps over 24 hours. Seasonal affective disorder and all the circadian rhythm disorders are related to a discrepancy between the duration of the solar day and the circadian cycle. The circadian cycle of humans and other mammals is close to one hour longer than the 24 hours period from sunrise to sunrise. Interestingly, birds show a circadian cycle of less than 24 hours and close to 23 hours. Terrestrial invertebrates, the insects provide the key to understanding this discrepancy. The earliest identifiably mammalian fossils are from the Permian era strata. Insect orders that first appeared in the Permian era include the Hemiptera (bugs), Orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers), Coleoptera (beetles) and the Neuroptera (lacewings). All of whose modern survivors show a circadian cycle longer than 24 hours in at least some stage of the life cycle. The insects whose ancestors first appeared in Mesozoic strata with the birds include Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Their modern survivors, like the birds, demonstrate a circadian rhythm shorter than 24 hours. It is proposed here that the duration of these animal classes circadian day may reflect the duration of the solar day at the time of their origin. There is now evidence for three large meteorite impacts on Pangea near the end of the Permian era, one in Wilkes Land of Antarctica, one near the Falkland Islands, and one just west of Australia. The eastward movement of the Australian, African, and Eurasian continent/plate and the southeastward movement of the Antarctic continents/plates suggest that those meteorites were moving eastwards and struck the planet obliquely. Having done so, they might have imparted momentum to the planet’s rotation and so accelerated it. This may mean that circadian rhythm disorders are the consequence of a change in the duration of the solar day due to a disaster and that daytime lethargy and depression may have had adaptive value to the mammals who survived that disaster. If this is true, it adds context to our treatment of these disorders with bright light and melatonin",

      "title": "A Typical Children Followed-Up in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Five pre-school children with variability in the quality of their social relationships, unusual or abnormal speech and/or expressive language, and ritualistic or manneristic behaviors, were diagnosed as having an atypical pervasive developmental disorder. In order to study the natural history of this disorder these children were followed-up 10 years later. Four of the adolescents showed evidence of the persistence of social and communicative disorders consistent with a diagnosis of a pervasive developmental disorder (PDDNOS), while one was found to have a social phobia and the residual state of the PDDNOS. One of the PDD adolescents was actively psychotic. We find that young children diagnosed as having a pervasive developmental disorder with atypical features can have thinking disorders and/or poor reality testing which persists into adolescence, and can develop symptoms of childhood and adolescent schizophrenia. The overall cognitive functioning of young children diagnosed as having a pervasive developmental disorder with atypical features tends to be stable or perhaps even improve somewhat as they grow into adolescence. Parents are aware of, and can report, the presence of severe emotional and/or behavioral disturbance in such adolescents. The marked similarities in symptomatology, clinical course, and treatment histories, between this group and a group of adolescents who were not diagnosed as having a PDD until adolescence, suggests that there may be an underreporting or underdiagnosis of young children with pervasive developmental disorders.",

Studies of this problem explicitly show that the loss of the job exerts a detrimental health effect. A number of other factors decide about the significance of this relationship. The change from being employed to unemployment affects mostly mental health. First symptoms appear together with the danger of losing the job. Unemployment can evoke apathy, fear or frustration and then it leads to more serious disorders such as neuroses, depression and so forth. It can be also responsible for suicidal attempts. These disorders are usually associated with somatic complaints. Stress evoked by the loss of the job is the major factor affecting the health state of an unemployed person. The loss of income and social status is another important factor. Many authors turn particular attention to a growing intensity of all negative effects of unemployment if it lasts for a long period of time.",

      "abstract": "Mental illness is referred to as a condition that tends to impact a person's thinking, feeling or mood and may affect his or her ability to relate to others and function on a daily basis.Many children may grow up with a parent suffering from some mental health condition at some point of time in his/her life.Few of these children live with a parent who has severe psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.Coping with the stress of parental psychiatric illness is often very challenging for children as such illness creates an inconsistent, unpredictable family environment and may seriously hamper the parenting abilities of the couple.Children of such parents, while battling every day with the disorder of their parent, often experience stress of caring for the ill parent and also responsibility of siblings.They may themselves experience an array of problems including difficulties in concentrating on studies, anxiety, fear of developing same illness, so on and so forth.However, despite of these difficulties, some of these children seem to be achieving extraordinary success in their lives.They not only are able to do well in academics, but also maintain their emotional health, develop and sustain good relationships and at times reach out to help other individuals suffering from similar conditions out of compassion.What factors could be underlying this healthy coping?Could it be accounted to the differences in personality, resilience or specific coping strategies used by them?The present paper is a humble attempt to find answers to these questions.The aim of the study is to develop an in-depth understanding of above mentioned and many other such factors.Hence the qualitative analysis has been used.Specific research method used is narrative analysis which includes interviews with some such children (adult children).The implications of the research can be found in individual as well as group counseling, schools, colleges and other mental health care facilities.",

Nyeri muskuloskeletal seperti nyeri punggung bawah, osteoarthritis atau rematik dapat berkembang menjadi nyeri kronik bila berlangsung lebih dari 3 bulan. Nyeri kronik dan kesejahteraan psikologis memiliki kaitan yang sangat erat; nyeri kronik berdampak buruk pada kesejahteraan psikologis dan menurunkan kualitas hidup, sebaliknya, kesejahteraan psikologis juga memengaruhi perasaan subjektif nyeri yang dirasakan oleh penderitanya. Oleh karena itu, penanganan nyeri muskuloskeletal harus dilaksanakan secara komprehensif, bukan hanya dengan obat-obatan tetapi juga dengan latihan fisik, agar tidak berlanjut menjadi nyeri kronik. Setelah mengikuti kegiatan pengabdian masyarakat ini masyarakat diharapkan mempunyai pemahaman yang cukup mengenai nyeri muskuloskeletal, aspek psikologis dari nyeri, serta program latihan yang dapat dilakukan scara mandiri di rumah untuk mengatasi nyeri.",

      "abstract": "Episode depresif merupakan diagnosis kejiwaan yang termasuk dalam kelompok diagnosis gangguan mood afektif. Kelainan fundamental dari gangguan jiwa kelompok ini adalah adanya perubahan yang nyata pada suasana perasaan (mood) atau afek menuju ke arah depresi yang ditandai dengan kemurungan, kelesuan, ketidakgairahan hidup, perasaan tidak berguna, dan putus asa. Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi. Pasien didiagnosis dengan aksis I: (F.32.11) episode depresif sedang dengan gejala somatik, aksis II: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis III: tidak ada diagnosis, aksis IV: masalah dengan psikososial, dan aksis V: Global Assestment of Functioning (GAF) score 70-61 (pada saat pemeriksaan). Pasien mendapatkan terapi psikofarmaka dengan obat antidepresan golongan Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) Fluoxetin 1x10 mg dan obat antiansietas golongan benzoiazepine Merlopam 2x5 mg yang dikombinasikan dengan psikoterapi suportif Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Kombinasi pemberian obat tersebut memiliki efek samping yang minimal dan tingkat keberhasilan yang lebih baik. Episode depresif pada pasien ini disebabkan oleh kekhawatiran pasien yang berlebihan terhadap penyakit kista folikel yang dideritanya.

      "abstract": "The main criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are a change in cognitive function with rapid onset of symptoms and/or fluctuating sensorium, impairment of attention and development of perceptual disturbance. Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

      "abstract": "Stress is crucial to the survival of an organism, but excessive stress can lead to psychological disorders including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and suicidality. The prevailing notion is that chronic stress promotes adverse outcomes on brain and body health, whereas acute stressors are generally benign. Notably, acute events such mass shootings or natural disasters are now emerging as significant sources of cognitive and emotional problems including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These events are characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of physical, emotional, and social stresses, which last minutes to hours. Hence, there is a need to model such multiple concurrent acute stresses (MAS) to uncover the mechanisms by which they lead to profound adverse outcomes. The MAS paradigm described here involves simultaneously exposing a rodent to several different stressors including restraint, crowding, and jostling alongside peers in a brightly lit and very noisy environment. Moreover, the MAS paradigm can be used once or imposed repeatedly to emulate complex, repeated modern life stresses, advancing our mechanistic understanding of consequent mental and cognitive impairments.",

      "abstract": "Para lograr cuerpos y mentes saludables se recomienda la actividad atlética. Sin embargo, a pesar de las mejores precauciones, un jugador puede recibir un golpe a la cabeza o al cuerpo que ocasiona dolores de cabeza constantes. Se estima que alrededor del 90% de estas lesiones leves resuelven completamente y el atleta se encuentra sin síntomas a la semana. Desafortunadamente, el otro 10% se quedarán con cefaleas continuas y con otros síntomas neurológicos. La conmoción cerebral es una lesión a la cabeza que resulta en un cambio en la función cerebral normal. Las conmociones cerebrales pueden también ocurrir cuando hay una caída o un golpe al cuerpo causando una sacudida tal, que el cerebro se mueve rápidamente en múltiples direcciones. Los síntomas provocados por una conmoción cerebral usualmente son leves, pero pueden resultar en confusión, cefalea, pérdida de la memoria, dificultad para pensar y concentrarse, problemas para tomar decisiones, pérdida del equilibrio y la coordinación. Otros síntomas comúnmente asociados son mareos, fatiga, irritabilidad, ansiedad, depresión, y cambios en el patrón del sueño. Se considera que una cefalea es causada por una lesión a la cabeza si comienza o empeora durante la semana tras la conmoción cerebral. El tipo de cefalea más común luego de un traumatismo a la cabeza es la migraña y la segunda más común es la cefalea tensional. La migraña luego de una conmoción cerebral se diagnostica cuando un atleta desarrolla una cefalea asociada a nausea y/o sensibilidad a la luz o al ruido. Las cefaleas tensionales no tienen estas características. Luego de una conmoción cerebral, se le aconseja al atleta evitar cualquier actividad que pueda resultar en una segunda conmoción cerebral, especialmente antes que se haya recuperado de la primera. Los atletas no deben participar en deportes si continuan teniendo síntomas. La actividad vigorosa se debe evitar si, por ejemplo, hay dificultad recordando los acontecimientos inmediatamente antes o después del traumatismo o si hay lentitud del pensamiento o la memoria. El atleta no debe volverse a ejercitar vigorosamente hasta que el pensar, la atención, la concentración, y la memoria regresen a la normalidad. Las tomografías computarizadas (TC) pueden ser útiles para descartar lesiones graves como sangrado, pero no pueden diagnosticar una conmoción cerebral. Se cree que durante una conmoción cerebral hay un cambio en el metabolismo cerebral que causa una cascada de síntomas, que incluyen inflamación y cambios químicos que resultan en las cefaleas. En la mayoria de las conmociones cerebrales no hay pruebas de laboratorio o imágenes radiológicas que demuestren las cefaleas. No hay fármaco que beneficie claramente a un atleta que tiene una cefalea postconmocional. Los fármacos para tratar las cefaleas pueden ser útiles, pero no son curativos. La mayoría de las cefaleas postraumáticas mejoran con el tiempo y al evitar una segunda conmoción cerebral. Los medicamentos preventivos utilizados para los dolores de cabeza pueden ser útiles si el dolor de cabeza persiste por más de un mes. Se deben escoger fármacos preventivos que se enfoquen en tratar los síntomas del atleta. Los medicamentos usados para estas cefaleas pueden causar fatiga, aumento de peso, y problemas de memoria por lo que pueden contribuir a la confusión. Es importante informar a los atletas que los medicamentos pueden ayudar con los síntomas, pero no curan el problema, asi se evita decepción con el tratamiento. Los atletas que han padecido de conmoción cerebral anteriormente se encuentran en mayor riesgo de sufrir una segunda conmoción cerebral. Esto es particularmente cierto en los primeros 10 días tras la primera conmoción cerebral. Otros riesgos incluyen, haber jugado el deporte durante un periodo de tiempo más largo y la predisposición genética llamada ApoE4. El mejor curso a tomar después de una conmoción cerebral es modificar el estilo de vida hasta que haya una recuperación total. El descanso y dormir bien se recomiendan inicialmente para que el cerebro se recupere. Se deben evitar actividades como los ejercicios vigorosos o cualquier deporte en el que una segunda lesión a la cabeza pueda ocurrir. Los síntomas pueden empeorar con las luces brillantes y cambiantes, como las que pueden verse en los videojuegos, y las atracciones en parques de diversiones, donde el cuello y la cabeza están en movimiento. Es mejor posponer el uso prolongado de la computadora y el hacer tareas que requieran pensar mucho y el uso de la memoria. Los factores que pueden predecir un síndrome postconmocional más duradero incluyen la confusión, la amnesia, la fatiga, y la desorientación. Otros factores asociados a un síndrome postconmocional más largo incluyen ser atleta joven, historial previo de dolor de cabeza y mareo. Las lesiones que ocurren en terrenos artifícales son más propensas a resultar en lesiones severas. Es importante evitar una conmoción cerebral. El equipo de protección ayuda en ciertos deportes, en especial cuando se practica el “rugby”. El riesgo de conmoción cerebral es más alto en jugadores de fútbol americano que tienen posiciones de apoyador (“linebacker” en inglés) y liniero ofensivo o defensivo. En el hockey sobre hielo el arrebatar el puck al jugador contrario con una carga efectuada con el cuerpo (“body checking” en inglés) aumenta el riesgo de conmoción cerebral. Un mayor índice de masa corporal y entrenar menos de 3 horas también aumenta el riesgo. La conmoción cerebral es un diagnóstico clínico, es decir, que se basa en síntomas y no en pruebas específicas. Las listas de verificación y las pruebas neuropsicológicas pueden ser útiles en determinar la severidad y monitorear el progreso, pero no se pueden utilizar para hacer un diagnóstico definitivo. Cualquier persona en la que se sospeche una conmoción cerebral necesita ser removida del juego inmediatamente y ser evaluada por un médico. Como se ha señalado anteriormente, los jugadores más jóvenes como los de la escuela secundaria tardan más en recuperarse que los atletas mayores y por eso el tiempo necesario antes de regresar a jugar es más largo. Una recuperación completa del cerebro se puede esperar en la mayoría de los casos. Para lograrla es importante darle al atleta tiempo y descanso.

There are three factors namely; mental breakdown, mental disturbances, and mental illness impair the mental health of employees. Stress is an unavoidable aspect of life. Workplace stress derives specifically from conditions in their workplace. This condition may either cause stress initially or aggravate the stress already present from other sources. Studies have pointed to the growth in non-standard work and other changing work patterns as contributing to a recent sharp increase in stress leads in the workplace. In organizations the ergonomic the concern is work stress, which in any action from an external source that affects the body. This creates a strain in the body resulting in some physiological response to the stress. Work stress due to unusual posture or improper postural adjustment to the work results in back pain, headaches, nervousness, aching muscles, excessive perspiration and depressions. The most serious result of work stress is serious traumatic injuries, accumulative injuries or death. Psychological factors that may cause stress are excessive heat, improper furniture (chairs, tables etc.), poor workplace, long work hours or any other type of situation in which individual performs his or her work in unusual situation or in a continuous manner. Ill health results in high rate of absenteeism and turnover, industrial discontent and indiscipline, poor performance and low productivity and more accidents. Besides, employee’s health also provides other benefits such as improved morale of employees, increased productivity of employees and also longer working period of an employee which, of course cannot be easily measured.",

O objetivo\r\ndeste estudo foi desenvolver um protocolo de EMS e investigar os efeitos do protocolo em idosos\r\ncom demencia, residentes em instituicoes de longa permanencia para idosos (ILPI) filantropicas. O\r\nestudo foi desenvolvido com 60 idosos com demencia moderada ou avancada (pontuacoes na Clinical\r\nDementia Rating — CDR = 2 ou 3 e no Mini-Exame do Estado Mental — MEEM ≤ 17) divididos\r\nem grupos de intervencao (GI) (n=30) e controle (GC) (n=30) e seus cuidadores formais.

Whereas most symptoms of the initial prodromal condition appear to be rather un-specific and hard to distinguish from other psychiatric conditions especially depressive ones, some syndromes seem to enable an early detection and thus an indicated prevention. These are constituted by attenuated and/or transient psychotic symptoms on the one hand and certain cognitive–perceptive basic symptoms on the other. Whereas the former are thought to delineate an advanced prodromal state, the latter can occur early in course and even at the beginning of the transition sequence to first-rank symptoms.

Behavioral problems include repeated deviant behavior or aggression among children. Such conduct problems often lead to criminal behavior or substance abuse and place the society as a whole under substantial financial burden and distress. Thus, these conditions are serious public health concerns. Such mental health problems in children may be caused by developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (also known as ADHD), and mental disorders such as schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. SS is characterized by a triad of altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular abnormalities [Boyer and Shannon, 2005]. The syndrome is, for some authors, a loose term to define the clinical picture at the moderate to severe end of a spectrum of serotonin toxicity, mild symptoms of which include tremor, hyperreflexia, and occasional myoclonus [Gillman and Whyte, 2004]. In the severe forms of toxicity, generalized myoclonus, sustained ankle clonus, and hyperreflexia may occur along with hyperthermia, which is associated with increased mortality [Gillman, 2013]. SS is classically associated with the high doses of a single selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use, or with a combination of two or more serotonergic agents [Mason et al. 2000].\r\n\r\nFluoxetine is metabolized in the liver by the isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP2D6 [Blazquez et al. 2012]. The role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of fluoxetine may be clinically important, as there is a great genetic variability in the function of this enzyme [Gaedigk, 2013].\r\n\r\nAripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, which is a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptors, is equally metabolized via both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 isoenzymes [Molden et al. 2006]. Therefore, coadministration with fluoxetine (a potent inhibitor of CYP450 2D6) may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole. On the other hand, aripiprazole has no known effect on fluoxetine metabolism [Boulton et al. 2010].\r\n\r\nHere, we describe a case in which increased plasma concentration of aripiprazole due to a drug interaction with fluoxetine led to SS.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a serious brain disorder and one of the most debilitating and baffling mental illnesses known. It is a disease that makes it difficult for a person to tell the difference between real and unreal experiences, to think logically, to have normal emotional responses to others, and to behave normally in social situations. People with schizophrenia may also have difficulty in remembering, talking, and behaving appropriately. Schizophrenia is one of the more serious mental illnesses and can have a variety of symptoms. This illness varies in its severity from one individual to another, and also within any one afflicted individual from one time period to another. Sometimes these symptoms come on suddenly, but most often, the illness develops slowly over months or even years. At first, symptoms may go unnoticed or may be confused with those of other conditions. For example, people with Schizophrenia may feel tense, be unable to concentrate, or have difficulty sleeping. Those afflicted also become increasingly isolated and socially withdrawn. As the illness progresses, the symptoms often become more bizarre, and are described as symptoms of psychosis. The person develops peculiar behavior, speaks nonsensically, and may develop hallucinations, that is, they may see, feel, smell, or hear things that are not really there. During the psychotic phase, people with Schizophrenia may also suffer from delusions, i.e., have thoughts that are fragmented, bizarre, and have no basis in reality. They may also develop disordered thinking and speech patterns in which the associations among their thoughts and words are very loose. Schizophrenia seems to worsen and improve in cycles known as relapses and remission, respectively. At times, patients may appear relatively normal, but usually there will be repeated episodes of the illness that will cause the symptoms to reappear. It is one of the most common serious illnesses that can cause repeated hospitalizations. Antipsychotic medications (often called neuroleptics) are very effective in controlling the symptoms of the illness. Because each person with Schizophrenia has a unique mix of symptoms no single medication works best for all people. Also, there is a high percentage of patients who do not comply with their medications due to bad side effects that they could not tolerate. However, a new generation of these antipsychotic medications has been shown to reduce the side effects, and more significantly has improved the quality of life of patients. Because of these new drugs, patients now are more integrated into society, some of them are able to graduate from college and many are gainfully employed and productive members of our society.",

There is clinical and experimental evidence that a patient's level of symptomatic distress is amplified by four factors as follows: the thoughts he has about his symptom, the degree to which he pays attention to it, his mood, and the situational context. These factors can be used therapeutically in maximizing palliation and symptomatic relief for patients with chronic medical diseases. Discussing the causes of the patient's symptoms can be helpful, as can strategies to maximize distraction and focus the patient's attention away from his body. Aggressive treatment of anxiety and depression is indicated in chronically symptomatic patients, and behavioral interventions to alter the family's response to the patient's symptoms can also be palliative.

      "abstract": "Die postpartalen psychischen Störungen lassen sich im Wesentlichen drei Gruppen zuordnen: Dem so genannten \"Baby Blues\", der Wochenbettdepression und der Wochenbettpsychose. Der etwa 3 - 5 Tage nach Entbindung auftretende Baby Blues kommt nach 50 - 70 % aller Geburten vor und klingt nach etwa einer Woche ohne weitere Therapie meist folgenlos ab. Allerdings entwickeln 20 - 30 % dieser Frauen im weiteren Wochenbettverlauf eine Depression, weshalb bei über 2 Wochen post partum persistierenden Bluessymptomen eine genauere Exploration hinsichtlich einer Depression zu empfehlen ist. Wochenbettdepressionen betreffen 10 - 15 % aller Entbundenen; sie treten meist mehrere Wochen bis Monate nach Entbindung in Form einer depressiven Verstimmung mit Schlafstörungen, Ängstlichkeit, Antriebsmangel, Interessenverlust und Schuldgefühlen bis hin zu Selbstmordgedanken auf. Um sie nicht als Babyblues fehlzudeuten, sind gezielte Fragen nach der Stimmungslage der jungen Mutter bei der Untersuchung 6 Wochen post partum, ggfs. unter Anwendung der Edinburgh-Skala zu empfehlen. Patientinnen mit bekannten Risikofaktoren für die Entwicklung einer Wochenbettdepression (Z.n. Wochenbettdepression oder Wochenbettpsychose, depressive Erkrankung, Angsterkrankung, bipolare Erkrankung) bedürfen einer engmaschigen Überwachung und ggfs. einer prophylaktischen Behandlung in Kooperation mit dem Psychiater. Leichtere Formen der Wochenbettdepression sind ambulant mit psychotherapeutischen und soziotherapeutischen Maßnahmen meist gut zu behandeln. Bei schwereren Verläufen sind Antidepressiva (selektive Serotoninwiederaufnahmehemmer (SSRI) oder bestimmte Trizyklika) indiziert. Postpartale Angst- und Zwangsstörungen sprechen gut auf Psychotherapie an; bei Angsterkrankungen werden außerdem Benzodiazepine, bei Zwangserkrankungen SSRI empfohlen. Wochenbettpsychosen (ca. 0,1 - 0,2 %) treten vermehrt bei bekannter bipolarer oder schizoaffektiver Störung bzw. bei Z.n. Wochenbettpsychose auf. Sie müssen vor allem wegen der Gefahr des erweiterten Suizids stationär behandelt werden; idealerweise erfolgt dies in interdisziplinären Mutter-Kind-Einheiten.",

      "abstract": "Mental trauma can be caused by single or multiple traumatic events during lifetime or by long-lasting psychological and/or psychosocial stress. Especially chronic stress is a major burden of modern life and poses a clear risk factor for a plethora of somatic and psychiatric disorders. A role of the immune system in the development of stress-associated somatic and psychiatric disorders is very likely, given that: i) both stress-associated somatic and mental disorders go along with a dysregulated and over-reacting immune system; ii) risk factors for mental disorders promote immune hyper-reactivity to psychosocial stress and iii) chronic psychosocial stress induces chronic low-grade inflammation in healthy individuals. Because bone and especially bone regeneration are highly influenced by osteoimmunological mechanisms, we hypothesized that chronic stress and mental health problems might be associated with disturbances in bone homeostasis and healing. We investigated that in various preclinical models for chronic psychosocial stress during pregnancy, childhood or during adulthood. We found that stress during pregnancy induced an osteopenic bone phenotype in male offspring only, while early life stress induced a mild osteocatabolic phenotype in female mice only. In contrast, chronic adult stress did not affect the bones of female mice, while male mice displayed reduced long bone length and disturbed endochondral ossification. Because endochondral ossification is also important for secondary fracture healing, we investigated the effects of chronic adult stress on bone regeneration in male mice. Indeed, we found a disturbed inflammatory response towards fracture with increased number of catecholamine-producing neutrophils in the fracture hematoma. This led to reduced endochondral ossification and thereby contributing to disturbed bone regeneration. In conclusion, we could show that chronic stress during various phases of life might affect bone health in a sex-dependent manner and might also interfere with bone regeneration. Molecular mechanisms might be a dysregulated immune system and thereby osteoimmunological crosstalks.",

The pattern was of mild but typical depressive symptoms. Residual symptoms were more common in subjects with more severe initial illness, but were not related to any other predictors, including longer prior illness, dysthymia, or lower dose of drug treatment during the illness episode. There were weak associations with personality that might have been consequences of symptom presence. Residual symptoms were very strong predictors of subsequent early relapse, which occurred in 76% (13/17) of those with residual symptoms and 25% (10/40) of those without.",

The unexpected events are generally associated with cognitive disruption, including rumination and attempts to understand what happened and why. Socially, traumas are known to cause wholesale disruptions in people’s social networks. Behaviorally, and perhaps because of the social and psychological changes, traumas are often associated with lifestyle changes such as unhealthy smoking, drinking, exercise, sleeping, and eating patterns. Each of these psychological, social, and behavioral effects is associated with a host of biological changes, including elevations in cortisol, immune disruption, cardiovascular changes, and a cascade of neurotransmitter changes.",

The disorder has received attention from a wide range of clinicians and researchers. The mechanism of causation of this disorder has been poorly understood, though biological, psychological and social factors seem to play a role. The disorder causes significant impairment and is highly comorbid with other disorders.

She describes her mood as up and down and is referred by her neurologist for psychiatric assessment of mood swings and possible depression. Fatigue limits her ability to work full-time, perform household duties, socialize with friends and family, and enjoy mental or physical exercise. In addition, her 18-year-old daughter--an important source of psychological support--is planning to leave home. Mrs. S experienced depression 5 years ago during her divorce. She was prescribed paroxetine, 20 mg/d, and had a positive response. She took the medication for 6 months, then discontinued. One-half of MS patients experience major depression in their lifetimes, (1) and the suicide rate is approximately doubled in MS patients compared with the general population. (2) Depression in MS patients often has an atypical presentation, with irritability and anger being as prominent as sadness. (3) Not all emotional changes experienced by MS patients represent depressive disorders, however. When evaluating MS patients who are struggling with depression, you can help them by diagnosing comorbid mood disorders, determining suicide risk, and providing psychological support as they cope with the impact of their illness. MS disease course MS is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, characterized by: * inflammatory demyelination and gliosis * neuronal and axonal loss * a variety of presenting symptoms as different CNS regions are affected. Focal areas of demyelination followed by a reactive gliosis cause white matter lesions in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. Neurologic dysfunction can manifest as visual changes, spastic paresis, hypoesthesia and paresthesia, ataxia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. MS presentation also can include optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. MS symptoms often are intensified by heat exposure. After the initial episode, months or years may pass before additional neurologic symptoms appear. Based on its course, MS can be classified as: * relapsing-remitting, when the disease does not progress between attacks * secondary progressive, characterized by a gradually progressive course after an initial relapsing-remitting pattern * primary progressive, when patients experience gradual progressive disability from symptom onset (Table 1, page 80). CASE CONTINUED Progressing symptoms Mrs. S has had multiple MS presentations, including optic neuritis, lower extremity weakness, balance problems, and urinary incontinence. Recently, her MS symptoms have gradually progressed even in the absence of attacks, and her diagnosis has been revised to secondary progressive MS. During psychiatric evaluation, Mrs. S denies persistent changes in sleep or appetite. She describes fatigue that starts after physical exertion and increases as the day progresses. She denies feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, excessive guilt, and suicidal ideation and does not have a history of inappropriate anger or irritability. Diagnosing depression in MS Normal emotional adjustment to MS can include reactions to loss of function or changes in social or occupational roles. Further, MS patients--similar to non-MS patients--experience life changes and transitions not related to the illness, such as divorce or a grown child moving away. Emotional responses to life stressors often are self-limited but may warrant an adjustment disorder diagnosis if they are associated with excessive distress or substantial impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning (Table 2, page 82). (4) Female MS patients and those who report high stress or a family history of affective disorder may be more likely to develop clinical depression. (5) Several studies have reported correlations between structural brain abnormalities and depression in MS. …",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

      "title": "The influence of chronic stress on health and coping mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Stress represents a negative life experience, closely followed by physiological, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral changes that focus on changing the event or adapting to its effects. Any situation or occurrence that requires adaptation can be experienced as a stress, even positive situations and circumstances may be stressful, whether they come from the outside world, or the sources of stress is internal. While acute stress does not necessarily have a negative effect, if it lasts for a long time, or is frequently repeated, it becomes chronic, and can cause various serious disorders. During chronic stress, there is an exhaustion of the body's capacity for an adequate reaction, which can lead to long-lasting immunological dysfunction, which significantly impairs health and quality of life. According to the WHO (2017), stress is one of the causes of even 60% known diseases, and in a number of mental disorders a direct connection with stress has been reported: in acute stress reactions, \"posttraumatic stress disorder\", adjustment disorders and other reactions to severe stress. In addition, in all categories of mental disorders (ICD-10), the stressful situation or event plays a significant role in occurrence of the symptoms. A particular category of stress-related disorders are psychosomatic disorders. These are functional disorders in which there is no pathoanatomic substrate. In contrast to these, psychosomatic diseases are the type of illness in which there are structural changes of tissues and organs, the etiology of which is based on chronic stress, in addition to a number of other factors (Adamović, 1983) and which occur when there is a biological predisposition. The paper presents the mechanism of development of these diseases and some of the ways of coping with stress. According to the DSM-V, psychosomatic diseases are divided into skin diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, respiratory diseases, heart and blood vessel diseases, disorders of endocrine glands, rheumatoid diseases, gynecological diseases and others. In order to overcome stress and preserve health, psychological strategies for coping with stress play an important role. Multiple strategies are used, which include various stress control techniques: relaxation techniques, meditation methods, and assertive training, biofeedback and stress inoculation techniques. Successful mastering of coping stressful situations, constructive problem solving in life crisis, relaxation techniques and contributions to better adaptation to unexpected changes in life are of key importance for both mental and physical health.",

In studies evaluating the possible role of depression in these associations, depression among sexually assaulted persons did not account for their poorer health. Although there are unanswered questions in the literature on the associations between sexual assault and health, existing findings are consistent with standard criteria for inferring causal relationships from observational data. For example, many assault-health associations are supported by multiple, independent studies, and many demonstrate dose-response relationships (i.e., more incidents of sexual assault, or more severe assaults, are associated with more adverse health outcomes).",

      "abstract": "Emotional disorders accompany many somatic diseases, especially ones with severe or chronic course, and such are allergic diseases. Long-term course of the disease, the need for chronic treatment and repeated exacerbations as well as symptoms of depression or anxiety have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients, constituting a serious burden both from the point of view of the individual and the society. The data evaluating emotional disturbances and their impact on the quality of life in three atopic diseases: bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis and seasonal rhinitis were analysed. Mood disorders as well as mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol abuse are the most common psychiatric disorders observed in patients with bronchial asthma. There are data indicating a relationship between the occurrence of allergic rhinitis and mood disorders, anxiety disorders and suicidal tendencies. Atopic dermatitis is associated with an increased risk of depressive and anxiety disorders and sleep disorders, and in children with more prevalence of behavioral disorders. Most studies highlighted the relationship between emotional disorders and quality of life in the above-mentioned patient groups. In addition to physical ailments, patients suffering from allergic diseases also report emotional problems that can adversely affect the course of the disease, the treatment process, and reduce quality of life. Therefore, these patients require a holistic approach with a more accurate assessment of emotional disorders.",

After this prodromal phase, a persecutory delusion and hallucinations are often present in decompensated schizophrenia. In decompensated bipolar disorder, the delusional syndrome is congruent with the mood. The care should be the earliest possible.

Supone la primera causa entre los pa- cientes que se suicidan a esta edad, genera gran sufrimiento en el propio paciente y en su familia, y es fuente de importante discapaci- dad por la propia enfermedad y por la reper- cusion en la evolucion de otras enfermedades comorbidas. Una vez diagnosticada y tratada, la evolucion de la enfermedad puede ser a una recuperacion completa del paciente, tan- to en lo sintomatico como en lo funcional. Sin embargo, es frecuente, en este periodo de la vida, que la enfermedad depresiva sea re- currente y que por tanto haya que mantener el tratamiento antidepresivo durante varios anos o de manera continuada. Tambien resul- ta habitual que algunos de los sintomas no respondan de la misma manera al tratamiento farmacologico o de psicoterapia. En este caso, pueden hacerlo mas tarde que los sintomas nucleares o quedar como sintomas residuales. Estos sintomas pueden tener tanta importan- cia y repercutir de tal manera en la vida de los pacientes que condicionen el pronostico de la enfermedad que padecen. Los sintomas cognitivos, la ansiedad y las alteraciones de los ritmos biologicos, sobre todo el sueno, son los que requieren una mayor atencion, pero las ideas de muerte y de suicidio, los sinto- mas somaticos y la apatia constituyen tam- bien sintomas para tener en cuenta.

It is the first cause among patients who commit suicide at this age, generates great suffering in the patients and in their family, and is a source of significant disability due to the disease itself and the impact on the evolution of other comorbid diseases. Once diagnosed and treated, the evolution of the disease can be to a complete recovery of the patient, symptomatic and functional recovery. Howe- ver, it is frequent, in this period of life, that the depressive illness would be recurrent and that therefore it would be necessary to main- tain the antidepressant treatment for several years or continuously. It is also common that some of the symptoms do not respond in the same way to the pharmacological treatment or psychotherapy. In this case, they can do it later than core symptoms do, or remain as residual symptoms. These symptoms can be so important and affect in such a way the life of the patients that condition the prognosis of the disease they suffer. Cognitive symp- toms, anxiety and alterations of biological rhythms, especially sleep, are those that re- quire more attention, but the ideas of death and suicide, somatic symptoms and apathy are also symptoms to be taken into account. Finally, some patients have resistant forms and do not respond to the treatment used, or they do it very partially. This article aims to review possible evolutions, to approach therapeutic harassment possibilities, and, finally, to examine some issues in the lives of these patients that could influence the coping of the disease.",

Loss of libido did not strongly indicate occurrence of depression, and in persons aged 70 years or over it could not be included in symptoms of depression. Sex dif ferences in the commonest symptoms of depression were evident: worry, crying spells, helplessness, loneliness, suicidal ideas and pains were more common in depressed women than in depressed men. Some age differences in symptoms were also found both in men and in women. Sad expression was a common sign of depression in both sexes. In addition, slow movements, scarcity of gestures and slow speech were quite common signs in depressed men and stooping posture was quite common in depressed women.",

Specific emotional abnormalities sometimes are associated with hypertension, and when these abnormalities are relieved the hypertension regresses. 3. Induced mental or emotional stress may be associated with elevation in the blood pressure, perturbation of renal blood flow and alteration in other dynamics of the circulation in normal persons and patients with hypertension. 4. Appropriate management of anxiety in patients with hypertension appears to modify favorably the subjective and possibly the objective condition of the patient while failure to deal successfully with anxiety or disregard of it appears to be associated with unfavorable progress both subjectively and objectively. 5. Certain personality patterns or habitual reactions may be characteristic of patients",

      "abstract": "Stwardnienie rozsiane (SM) to choroba powodująca powstawanie obszarów demielizacyjnych w centralnym układzie nerwowym, czego skutkiem mogą być objawy takie, jak: zaburzenia chodu, koordynacji, zaburzenia czucia, ból, zaburzenia wzroku, funkcji seksualnych czy funkcji kognitywnych. Udowodniono, że dysfunkcje seksualne występują u osób chorujących na SM często. Dysfunkcje te występują częściej niż w przypadku pacjentów cierpiących na inne przewlekłe choroby – 70% pacjentów ze stwardnieniem rozsianym dotkniętych jest problemami w sferze seksualnej. Patofizjologia tych zaburzeń jest wieloczynnikowa. Jednym z czynników są uszkodzenia w centralnym układzie nerwowym, innym współistniejące zaburzenia niezwiązane bezpośrednio z obszarami demielizacyjnymi, takie jak: zmęczenie, spastyczność, osłabienie siły mięśni czy skutki uboczne wdrożonej w procesie leczenia farmakoterapii. Należy podkreślić, że część dysfunkcji seksualnych u osób z SM ma podłoże psychologiczne i społeczne. Celem artykułu jest określenie medycznych i społecznych aspektów powstawania zaburzeń seksualnych u osób ze stwardnieniem rozsianym oraz zobrazowanie wpływu dysfunkcji seksualnych na funkcjonowanie jednostki w obrębie społeczeństwa.",

Its status as a clinical syndrome of childhood remains unclear. Many controversies surround various facets of this condition, foremost among these are questions relating to the duration of depressive disorders, the likelihood of recurrence, and the long-term outcome of depressed children. In the course of addressing these issues, attention is devoted to the outcomes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used research designs (prospective, retrospective, and catch-up prospective), the level of diagnosis used (symptom, syndrome, disorder), the significance of the age of onset on severity, and specific areas in need of further research. Among the tentative conclusions, it is asserted that many depressive symptoms are transient, diminishing or disappearing with age and/or changing environmental circumstances, but that severe depressive disorders do persist, with periods of remission, at least into the early adult years.",

      "abstract": "### Treatment of tobacco addiction\n\nMost smokers show symptoms of addiction to nicotine.1 The symptoms and signs of addiction are described by diagnostic classification systems, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . However, perhaps the most important symptom in this context is the failure of attempts to stop smoking when a person tries to accomplish this. Frequent smoking is thought to set up a subconscious learning process linked to the release of nicotine from cigarettes.2 When a person decides to stop smoking, s/he is afflicted by urges to smoke, often in places where smoking has previously taken place.3 Furthermore, such a person usually experiences withdrawal symptoms.4 These are mostly adverse moods, but with some physical symptoms as well. It is thought that these urges to smoke are primarily responsible for the failure of most attempts to stop smoking. Without support around half of all attempts to stop fail within the first week of attempted abstinence.5 The typical smoker who seeks treatment for cessation has never managed more than a few weeks without smoking.6 The period of withdrawal varies by symptom, but typically lasts a few weeks.4 Therefore most smokers' experience of not smoking is state of withdrawal and perhaps beliefs that smoking is a stress reliever, for example, stem from experiencing withdrawal during abstinence.\n\nThe two main approaches to assist cessation are pharmacotherapy and behavioural support. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation aims primarily to reduce the intensity of urges to smoke and/or ameliorate the aversive symptoms. Behavioural support aims to boost or support motivation to resist the urge to smoke and develop people's capacity to implement their plans to avoid smoking. These interventions last typically only a few months. It is thought that during these months, the strength of the associative learning between smoking and …",

In about 5 per cent of cases the alteration in mood may be accompanied by clouding of consciousness, delusions, hallucinations and disorientation. This picture of an organic confusional state is said to result from high doses and prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and ACTH. The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959).

      "abstract": "Health and disease processes are developed due to biological, psychological and social determinants. Obesity is usually associated with mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. This association is evidenced in both directions. Mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders, contribute to the development of obesity, as well as obesity increases the incidence of mental disorders. When stability and homeostasis are disrupted, due to chronic stress and factors such as genetics, environment, affective relationships and psychosocial support, allostatic overload is evidenced. Through this overload, multiple systems are misbalanced and clinical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, occur. The diagnoses of mental disorders are made based on a combination of somatic and psychiatric symptoms. Unexplained physical complaints and generic symptoms like depressed mood, sadness, impatience, irritability and restlessness are the most frequent ones, together with sleep and appetite disturbances, caused both by physical and mental disorders. These factors often make the correct diagnosis in obese patients more difficult. The primary care professionals must be alert to physical complaints and psychological distress present in organic disorders. The understanding of physiopatological effects of stress and emotional suffering in somatic disorders reinforce that effective care in chronic diseases, such as obesity, have to be organized including these aspects. Treatment needs to be comprehensive so that care can be effective and physical and mental disorders can be properly solved. New therapeutic approaches must be focused on the person, the family and the community instead of focused on the disease. This is essential in the treatment of obesity as it is directly associated with lifestyle, emotional state and stress level, which depends on a change of the individual and his ways of living to be solved. Through this approach, primary care may promote health and prevent diseases.",

Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico.

The measurement of these symptoms is essential for understanding the individual and planning treatment. There are various instruments that have somatic symptoms measurement in their items. The tools have included somatic symptoms measurement in measuring general psychopathology, somatic symptoms as part of anxiety and depression, somatic symptoms specifically, and as a screening instrument for somatoform disorders. The advantages and disadvantages of common measures have been discussed. It appears that no one measure fulfils the essential criteria of an ideal measure for somatic symptoms. The measures of somatic symptoms should also be culturally sensitive and serve diagnostic, prognostic and heuristic purposes. These aspects are highlighted in the review.",

Diabetes mellitus tipo 1 (DM1) e uma patologia caracterizada por producao insulinica deficiente, podendo apresentar como sintomas poliuria, polidipsia, fome constante, perda de peso e alteracoes visuais2. Individuos que possuem DM1 tem maiores escores em instrumentos para a identificacao de TMC3 e transtorno de personalidade (TP)4, principalmente aqueles que nao possuem exito no controle do nivel de glicose serico5. A saude mental de pacientes com DM1 ainda e mais fragil quando associada a fatores socioeconomicos desfavoraveis, dificultando a adesao ao tratamento, implicando em aumento das complicacoes da doenca e mortalidade6. Objetivos : Estimar a ocorrencia de TMC, depressao, e TP em pacientes com DM1 no ambulatorio do Conjunto Hospitalar de Sorocaba (CHS), estudar a associacao entre TMC e fatores sociodemograficos na populacao de DM1 e contribuir para a discussao sobre a relacao entre TMC, TP e DM1. Metodologia : O estudo foi conduzido no ambulatorio do CHS com pacientes que apresentam DM1. Foram aplicados os questionarios Self Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20), para rastreio dos transtornos mentais mais prevalentes, Inventario de Depressao de Beck, para quantificar depressao, Personality Disorder Questonnaire-4 (PDQ-4), que sugere a presenca de TP, alem do Questionario de dados sociodemograficos, todos de autopreenchimento. Justificativa : Existe uma associacao entre DM1 e transtornos psiquiatricos, dificultando a adesao ao tratamento, controle glicemico, levando ao aparecimento de complicacoes. Logo, o tratamento e prevencao dos transtornos psiquiatricos facilitaria o manejo e melhoraria a evolucao dos pacientes com DM1. Resultados e analise de Dados : Foram entrevistados 56 pacientes, sendo 78,57% mulheres (Tabela 1). Apos a aplicacao dos questionarios, 34 pacientes foram diagnosticados com algum transtorno psiquiatrico, sendo 17 com depressao e outros 17 com TP (Tabela 2). A prevalencia de TMC foi de 42,85%. Tambem foi realizada analise comparando os grupos I, sem transtornos diagnosticados pela aplicacao de questionario, e grupo II diagnosticados com TP ou depressao. No grupo I ha maior prevalencia de solteiros, enquanto no grupo II, 85,29% dos pacientes esta em um relacionamento estavel (p=0,005). Tambem fora possivel relacionar a presenca de TMC (p=0,006), TP (p=0,019) e depressao (p=0,009) com sexo, sendo uma correlacao prevalente nas mulheres, as quais tambem possuem menores indices socioeconomicos (p=0,026).

Man would deteriorate after a time at these heights even under the best con­ditions: if he is doing hard work and is subjected to many strains, mental and physical, other factors are brought to bear which will aggravate this basic state. Such factors are illness, exhaustion, starvation and dehydration. Symptoms similar to those of deterioration, but more acute in onset, appear if man goes too quickly to high altitudes without first acclimatizing. These symptoms of acute mountain sickness disappear if the subject returns to lower levels for some time. If he goes to moderate heights when acclimatizing he will be able to stay for reasonably long periods without undue trouble. Exhaustion at high altitudes is often only cured by coming down to lower levels, as above a certain height there seems to be little or no recovery.",

      "abstract": "From time to time, physicians encounter patients with a chief complaint of hyperosmia accompanied by multisystem symptoms and intolerances for a wide variety of chemicals, foods, and/or drugs (Ashford and Miller, 1998; Berglund et al., 1992; Doty et al., 1998). Often these patients say they become ill when exposed to various odors, often in response to cacosmia (Ryan et al., 1988) or dysosmia (Miller, 1996). For example, they may describe everyday exposures to fragrances, diesel exhaust, new plastic car interiors, household cleaners, etc. (Table 1), as being overpowering, \"stronger than ever before,\" or \"extremely irritating\" and triggering symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, memory difficulties, mental confusion, anxiety, irritability, depression, myalgias, arrhythmias, dyspnea, and every sort of gastrointestinal problem (Table 2). This clinical presentation has come to be known as multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) or multiple chemical intolerance. Patients presenting with this peculiar combination of subjective hyperosmia, multisystem symptoms, and multiple intolerances appear to be on the increase (AOEC, 1992; NIEHS, 1997; NRC, 1992). Later in this chapter, epidemiological and clinical studies of this phenomenon will be reviewed.",

      "abstract": "There is no doubt that exercise, a vital health-promoting activity, regardless of health status, produces numerous well-established physical, functional, and mental health benefits. Many people, however, do not adhere to medical recommendations to exercise consistently, especially if they have chronic illnesses. Put forth to explain this conundrum are numerous potential explanatory factors. Among these are mental health correlates such as anxiety, fear, fatigue, pain, motivation, and depression, as well as various self-efficacy perceptions related to exercise behaviors, which may be important factors to identify and intervene upon in the context of promoting adherence to physical activity recommendations along with efforts to reduce the cumulative health and economic burden of exercise non-adherence among the chronically ill and those at risk for chronic illnesses.",

      "abstract": "El Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad (TDAH, en lo sucesivo), constituye uno de los trastornos del desarrollo neuropsicologico que en la actualidad afecta a mas ninos y adolescentes, se estima una prevalencia de en torno al 5%, segun el DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association, 2013); y en el que coexisten diversos sintomas que van a ocasionar a la persona que lo padece serias dificultades para poder adaptarse de forma optima a los contextos en los cuales se ve inmersa. Dicho trastorno se caracteriza por un patron persistente de hiperactividad/impulsividad y/o inatencion superior a lo esperado de acuerdo con el nivel de desarrollo del individuo, apareciendo antes de los doce anos y alterando el funcionamiento normalizado del sujeto a nivel academico, familiar y social (Barkley, 2006; Lavigne y Romero, 2010; Miranda, 2000, 2004; Perez, 2009; Servera, 2005). El problema del que se parte para llevar a cabo nuestro estudio gira en torno a la escasa cantidad de investigaciones que existen con el objetivo de analizar los deficit que van mas alla de estos tres sintomas categoriales y que se producen a nivel social y emocional en los sujetos con Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad; especialmente en comparacion con el robusto cuerpo de estudios que se han llevado a cabo para profundizar en el origen y desarrollo de las alteraciones de corte cognitivo y conductual, asi como en las diferentes opciones que se ocupan de su diagnostico y tratamiento. Por tanto, la tesis que a continuacion se presenta, surge con dos objetivos fundamentales: en primer lugar, con el de proporcionar un modelo de comprension y explicacion del TDAH que, ademas de abordar los deficit de origen cognitivo y conductual, atienda al papel que las emociones desempenan en el comportamiento de las personas que padecen el trastorno, como influyen en su desarrollo y dominio social, asi como que relacion establecen con el resto de procesos neuropsicologicos implicados. Para ello, se llevara a cabo en la Parte Primera del estudio (capitulos 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o y 5o), una revision del concepto, las caracteristicas y los modelos explicativos mas extendidos en torno al origen y desarrollo del trastorno, particularmente en relacion con sus dificultades emocionales y sociales. En la Segunda Parte (capitulos 6o, 7o y 8o), se exponen los resultados de la investigacion llevada a cabo con una amplia muestra de personas con TDAH y sus familias, con el objeto de comprobar y analizar los beneficios de una intervencion especifica Emocional, Social y Cognitiva; disenada para potenciar procesos emocionales de identificacion, expresion y regulacion emocional, y consecuentemente: reducir problemas emocionales, mejorar sus habilidades socio-comunicativas y pragmaticas, potenciar sus habilidades mentalistas, sociales y de resolucion de conflictos. Ademas, se analiza la relacion que otras variables pueden tener sobre dichas competencias: como la edad de los participantes y el tipo de tratamiento recibido; asi como se comparan dichos resultados con los de un grupo control. Para poder llevar a cabo este tratamiento psicoeducativo, se ha elaborado y aplicado un Programa de Intervencion Emocional, Social y Cognitivo, destinado a ninos con TDAH de edades comprendidas entre los 7 y los 14 anos, y a sus padres.",

      "title": "Evaluación de la regulación emocional cognitiva en fibromialgia mediante el instrumento Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ)",
      "abstract": "Las emociones son parte de la vida cotidiana. Con el objetivo de alcanzar aquello nos proponemos (incluido mantener el bienestar), las personas utilizamos diferentes estrategias de regulacion emocional. La regulacion emocional es el proceso por el que tratamos de modificar la expresion de una emocion ante una determinada situacion. Existe un creciente interes en la investigacion de la regulacion de la emocion debido a sus implicaciones para la salud fisica y mental.Las personas con fibromialgia sufren dolor cronico generalizado que suele ir acompanado de una gran variedad de sintomas, entre los que destacan la fatiga persistente, rigidez muscular, sueno no reparador y dificultades cognitivas (fibrofog) en la atencion, la memoria o la concentracion. Sintomas de alta intensidad afectiva y de ansiedad son muy frecuentes en la fibromialgia, y los deficits en la regulacion de la emocion en pacientes con este sindrome son bien conocidos. Con una prevalencia mundial de 2 a 4% y en ausencia de un tratamiento curativo, esta constelacion de sintomas mencionada afecta gravemente la vida diaria de los pacientes. El impacto en el area personal, economica y social es dramatico.El Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) mide la regulacion de la emocion con base cognitiva (aquello que pensamos cuando surge una emocion ante una situacion en la vida). El CERQ captura nueve estrategias de regulacion de la emocion: Autoculparse, Aceptacion, Rumiacion, Centrarse en lo positivo, Focalizacion en planes, Reevaluacion positiva, Poner en perspectiva, Catastrofizacion y Culpar a otros. Estas estrategias de pueden ayudar a las personas a regular sus emociones, de una manera Adaptativa o Menos adaptativa, facilitando u obstaculizando el manejo de la situacion. En este sentido, el uso de estrategias regulatorias Menos adaptativas se concibe como un factor transdiagnostico de vulnerabilidad psicopatologica.En esta tesis doctoral, examinamos las propiedades psicometricas de la version en espanol del CERQ, cuyo formato fue adaptado (items agrupados por dimension) considerando los sintomas de la fibromialgia. Con este fin, recopilamos datos clinicos y de CERQ de 231 pacientes con fibromialgia que participaron en un ensayo aleatorizado y controlado realizado en el Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Deu (St. Boi de Llobregat, Espana). Los analisis de datos apoyaron las propiedades psicometricas del CERQ en pacientes con fibromialgia y confirmaron la estructura de nueve factores, una consistencia interna adecuada y una superposicion minima entre las subescalas, coincidiendo con estudios previos realizados con muestras clinicas y no clinicas. Ademas, los analisis de correlacion y regresion apoyaron la validez de construccion del instrumento CERQ.En resumen, en este trabajo llegamos a la conclusion de que la version adaptada del CERQ es un instrumento solido y util para evaluar la regulacion de la emocion cognitiva en la fibromialgia. Como resultado principal de esta tesis doctoral, tenemos una medida validada empiricamente para evaluar la frecuencia de uso de nueve estrategias de regulacion de la emocion cognitiva en pacientes con fibromialgia, que generalmente se caracterizan por dificultades de regulacion de la emocion. Los estudios futuros que utilicen un diseno longitudinal podran abordar algunos aspectos psicometricos pendientes del CERQ en pacientes con fibromialgia, como la estabilidad en el tiempo (fiabilidad test-retest) y la sensibilidad al cambio.",

In some cases, as in depression, the improvement in memory as the emotional disorder resolves may be offset directly by the antimemory effects caused by continued use of the drug. Because of the effects emotional illness has on cognitive function, normal volunteers are often used in clinical research investigating the effects of psychotropic drugs on memory. This means that drugs are tested in a single dose, or at most a few doses, rather than being administered for months or years as in the clinical situation. Drug testing in normal volunteers, therefore, may not detect longterm psychotropic drug effects on memory. Although the research data are",

The somatic manifestations are mediated through the autonomic and central nervous systems and are present as penile erection, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, deepened respiration and flushed facies. The psychologic reactions are experienced as specific pleasure and accompanying specific displeasure, or tension. As the tension becomes more acute, the degree of excitation increases. It is a unique feeling of pleasure, as well as prevailing discomfort, which demands relief in the ejaculation.

Nach der „Global Burden of Disease”-Studie der WHO gehören depressive Störungen schon jetzt zu den Erkrankungen, die zum größten Verlust an Lebensjahren aufgrund der Beeinträchtigung durch die Störung führen. Depressionen werden von den Betroffenen als beeinträchtigender erlebt als die meisten somatischen Erkrankungen. Hinzu kommt, dass viele chronische somatische Erkrankungen im Verlauf durch das Hinzutreten einer depressiven Störung weiter verkompliziert werden. Bei vielen Erkrankten wird die Diagnose nur mit großer Verzögerung oder gar nicht gestellt, und wenn sie richtig gestellt wird, erfolgt die Behandlung oft nur unzureichend. Wahrscheinlich werden weniger als 10 % der Betroffenen medikamentös adäquat behandelt. Dies liegt auch daran, dass nach wie vor nicht nur z.B. Patienten mit schizophrenen Störungen oder Substanzabhängigkeiten von gesellschaftlicher Stigmatisierung betroffen sind, sondern auch Patienten mit depressiven Störungen. Auch dies trägt dazu bei, dass viele von dieser schwerwiegenden Erkrankung Betroffene den Gang zum Arzt scheuen. Konsens ist heute auch, dass das Ziel der Behandlung nicht mehr nur die Response, d.h. das (partielle) Ansprechen auf die Therapie, sein darf, sondern dass in jedem Fall die Remission angestrebt werden muss.",

Por ejemplo, aún no está del todo claro, por la poca evidencia disponible, cómo se relacionan el estrés académico y los hábitos de estudio inadecuados o la ansiedad y la somnolencia diurna en un ambiente educativo con estas características. Si estas asociaciones se demuestran, o se llegan a entender mejor, se podría concluir entonces que estudiar medicina (en particular) o una carrera universitaria con demandas académicas y emocionales similares (en general), tendría un nexo causal con los problemas de salud vinculados con la ansiedad, las alteraciones del sueño y los altos índices de estrés. Estos problemas incluyen, por ejemplo, las enfermedades mentales, como la depresión, o las alteraciones cardiovasculares, como la hipertensión arterial.

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of major depressive episode in the elderly leads to impairment on several aspects of daily life, including life quality, morbid - mortality and increases rates of suicide risks. Stress and life events are frequent triggers of depressive episode in elderly. The present review aimed to explore the aspects related to the onset of depression in old age, focusing on psychosocial and stress. In order to achieve that, we systematically reviewed papers published in the Medline database from 2003-2013. From this study, we verify that depression in the elderly is a complex disorder, more often associated to psychosocial aspects and chronic stress than to genetic and biomarkers. Loneliness, daily and chronic stress, lack of social support, mourning and economical aspects such as retirement and job loss are major risk factors for depression. Generally, negative life events were noticed to cause poorer mental health in advanced age and cumulative stressful events or traumas untreated too. Furthermore, cognitive functions may be affected negatively by lifelong chronic stressors. These events can cause quite a few different impacts in distinct cultures and lifestyles. The consequences also depend on the duration, or on the life period that these episodes occur. The treatment of depression in the elderly should target both medication and psychotherapy in order to account for psychological aspects, especially treatments based on life review. These perspectives are important due to the possibility of development of specific target strategies in order to prevent those risk factors and improve quality of life in elderly. Many points were contradictorily related, overdue the papers had noticed different conclusions about the same studied points. Face of this, we grouped relevant articles with the same results. Notwithstanding, there were points that require more studies, considering the relevance of the theme.",

      "title": "Correlation of Stigma with Self-compassion in Patients with Bipolar Disorder",
      "abstract": "Background & Aims: The bipolar disorder is important mental disorder, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression.This chronic and complex disease affects the mood of the patient, causing continuous and abnormal mood changes from extremely good to extremely poor and depressed.These fluctuations often last for weeks or months.Frequent episodes of depression and mania affect the functioning of the individual in personal, professional, family, social, and cultural domains.Patients with the bipolar disorder experience a phenomenon known as stigma.Stigma is defined as a set of cognitions and behaviors that are activated by labeling, leading to social exclusion and isolation.The stigma of mental illness distinguishes the patients from other populations.The stigma of mental illness renders the patients incapacitated and socially isolated.In addition, the experience of stigma decreases the quality of life and health-seeking behaviors of the patients, threatening their socio-economic health.Subsequently, the social participation of patients with mental illness is disrupted, and they refrain from seeking social assistance.In fact, stigma leads to the rejection of patients with mental illness by the society, disrupting their emotional regulation and making them unable to have proper emotional regulation strategies.Furthermore, the stigma of mental illness causes the patients not to have appropriate coping strategies for the disease, hide their medical history from the medical staff, and avoid communicating with their friends after discharge from the hospital.Given the importance of the concept of stigma, identifying the positively correlated behaviors seems essential.Self-compassion is a positive behavior that may be associated with stigma.Individuals with high self-compassion are more likely to accept negative life events and have more accurate self-assessments and better mental health.Self-compassion is an important factor in the adaptive responses to the mood problems in patients with a history of recurrent depression.High self-compassion reduces the mental vulnerability of patients with mental illness to problems, their depression and social anxiety, shame caused by the illness, and selfcriticism.In contrast, the lack of self-compassion leads to self-judgment, a sense of further isolation, and a rush of negative emotions about oneself, which ultimately lead to the loss of intimacy in the relationships with others.Low self-compassion is present in a wide range of individuals with mental disorders and causes emotional distress, so that individuals with mental illness and low self-compassion are more likely to have suicidal thoughts.The present study aimed to assess the correlation between stigma and self-compassion in patients with the bipolar disorder.Materials & Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 200 patients with the bipolar disorder admitted to Iran Psychiatric Center in Tehran, Iran, who were selected via continuous sampling.Data were collected using a demographic data form and stigma and self-compassion tools.The demographic data form included data on age, gender, marital status, number of children, education level, occupation status, family history of mental disorders, number of family members, and number of admissions.The researcher evaluated the validity and reliability of the instruments.To determine validity, the instruments were provided to seven professors of the department of psychiatric nursing at Iran and",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a common complaint experienced by most of subjects during lifetime, which affects approximately 30-50% of general population as point prevalence. 1 According to the fatigue-lasting duration, it is classified as acute (<1 month), prolonged (>1 month, <6 months), and chronic fatigue (≥6 months), respectively.Acute fatigue is generally disappears after taking a rest or treating the causative diseases, while uncontrolled prolonged and chronic fatigue limit the physical and social activities. 2 Especially, medically unexplained chronic fatigue is a debilitating status, such as idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).On the other hand, to distinguish CFS from chronic fatigue or ICF is very important in clinical practice.The reason is that although patients present fatigue symptom as their main complaint in subjects suffering from chronic fatigue or CFS, CFS is considered as to being in totally different pathologic illness. 3In 2015, US Institute of Medicine (IOM) reported diagnostic criteria for CFS as follows; three mandatory symptoms, a substantial impairment in activities accompanied by fatigue persisting for more than 6 months, postexertional malaise (PEM) and unrefreshing sleep, and one optional symptom among cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. 4nlike chronic fatigue, CFS has characteristics of brain and CNS symptom and is counted as a complex, multisystem neuroimmune disease.As commonly referred to myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)/CFS together, brain inflammation is frequently implied in pathology of CFS. 5 Above facts brought a necessity of new name which distinguishes CFS from chronic fatigue, without the word \"fatigue\".IOM therefore recommended \"systemic exertion intolerance",

La identificación del duelo complicado es central para poder ofrecer tratamientos adecuados. Sin embargo, no se conoce con claridad el perfil sintomatológico, ni la influencia que tienen el tipo de pérdida en la intensidad del duelo. En este estudio descriptivo participaron un total de 68 personas que habían sufrido una pérdida, al menos seis meses antes de la evaluación. Completaron una batería de pruebas sobre intensidad del duelo y psicopatología. Los resultados señalan que todas las variables psicopatológicas mostraron altas relaciones significativas con la intensidad de síntomas de duelo. La centralidad con que se percibió la pérdida y los sentimientos de hostilidad predijeron en gran medida los valores de duelo complicado y con mayor intensidad de experiencias de duelo y de síntomas psicopatológicos. El perfil sintomatológico en duelo complicado se relaciona con un gran abanico de psicopatología. La pérdida de un hijo parece ser un importante factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de duelo complicado. The loss of a loved one may provoke complicated grief, which is characterized by intense symptoms of yearning, sadness, or loss of life meaning. Identifying those at risk of developing complicated grief is crucial to provide adequate treatment. However, little is known about the symptom profile or the influence that the type of loss may have on grief intensity. A descriptive design was carried out. A total of 68 participants that have lost a loved one due to death, at least six months ago, took part on the research. They completed a range of emotional self-report measures. All psychopathological variables showed high and significant relations with the intensity of grief. The centrality perceived and feelings of hostility predicted the score of complicated grief. Finally, the loss of a son was associated with complicated grief and with higher scores on the experiences of loss and emotional psychopathology. Symptom profile of those with complicated grief is associated with a large number of psychopathological variables, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The loss of a son seems to be an important risk factor for developing complicated grief.",

Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest. The best examples are probably stroke and cardiovascular disease.

      "title": "Anxiety and Separation Disorders",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Anxiety is a physiologic response necessary for all human beings to survive. It helps protect individuals in dangerous situations and prepares them for challenges. Fears are the emotional response to a given stimuli or situation that is identified as threatening or scary. Fears are a normal part of development throughout childhood and adolescence, and they change throughout the life course (Table 1). Worries are the cognitive or thinking manifestations of fear and anxiety.Anxiety disorders are diagnosed when fears, worries, or anxiety occur outside the range of normal developmental responses or are extreme and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning (school, home, social settings). In anxiety disorders, the fear response is no longer adaptive and is either out of proportion to a stressor or occurs when there is no threat. Due to the physiologic mechanisms activated with the anxiety and stress response in the body, individuals who have chronic anxiety and stress have a greater risk of both physical and mental health problems. Individuals who have anxiety often present to their primary clinicians with frequent physical complaints, not necessarily reporting anxiety. Parents also may report significant changes in behavior, with increased opposition and tantrums in certain situations that are triggered by anxiety.Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses in children and adolescents, affecting 8% to 10% of this population. (1) The age of onset of anxiety disorders can be as early as the preschool years, but the condition generally does not cause substantial impairment until school age. Anxiety disorders can occur throughout the lifespan, but most adult anxiety disorders begin by early adolescent years. (2) Girls have twice the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders as boys. (1) Anxiety disorders can cause family distress and dysfunction, school refusal and avoidance, and social isolation. Untreated anxiety disorders increase the risk of developing further anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse. The long-term social impact of untreated anxiety disorder includes decreased academic and occupational achievement and poorer social and relationship outcomes. Anxiety disorders can be accompanied by comorbid conditions, such as medical illnesses, secondary anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, learning disorders, and mood disorders.Anxiety disorders tend to run in families, and this finding is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The reasons children develop an anxiety disorder are complex, but genetics, temperament, modeling, physiologic factors, and exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors all can contribute. Some young children have temperament styles that cause them to be more anxious and avoidant in new or unfamiliar situations, also known as behavioral inhibition. This temperament style increases the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in childhood, (3) but many children have no identifiable predisposing factors and still develop anxiety disorders. Some individuals have a heightened physiologic arousal to stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, which also can increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder. Maternal depression and anxiety have a significant influence on attachment, affecting the early environment and brain development of children. Maternal depression and anxiety can influence appropriate emotion regulation and stress responses, the effects of which can manifest as psychiatric illnesses, such as disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. Environmental and psychosocial stressors, including school issues, social difficulties, family dysfunction, trauma, and loss, can contribute to anxiety disorders.Anxiety is a physiologic response that is essential to the survival of human beings, involving fright/flight neurobiology and the stress response system. (4) The fright/flight response in the brain is regulated through sensory input (thalamus), context and memory (hippocampus), and emotion regulation (amygdala) systems, often referred to as components of the limbic system. This system is activated under stress and danger and prepares the body physiologically by activating the sympathetic adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The prefrontal cortex helps to modulate this response in the brain and to modify fear responses.In anxiety disorders, the fright/flight mechanism is activated in situations that are not a threat or overresponds in reaction to the stressor without appropriate response modulation. The release of stress hormones and adrenaline in the body inappropriately or in excess (given the situation) without appropriate regulation causes the feelings of fear and physical symptoms of anxiety (eg, stomachaches, nausea, headaches, increased heart rate, dizziness, sweating, shortness of breath, paresthesias, chest pain). Avoidance, tantrums, aggression, crying, trembling, somatic complaints, and seeking of reassurance all are common manifestations of anxiety. The avoidance and reliance on others to help manage fears may help to decrease anxiety temporarily but can become extreme and interfere with functioning at home, school, and socially and cause anxiety to worsen over time.Anxiety for some children may occur only in very specific situations or environments and for others can be more generalized. It is important to distinguish between appropriate and adaptive anxiety and stress and an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder is of long duration (usually lasting for many months), interferes substantially with functioning, and is out of synch with the magnitude of the stressor and developmental stage of the child. Adaptive anxiety and stress occur after a substantial change or transition (eg, starting school) and are expected responses to change or adversity. Anxiety disorders usually require intervention by a clinician; stress usually is of short duration (fewer than 2 weeks) and is likely to resolve spontaneously or be substantially ameliorated by social support or environmental modification alone.Diagnosis of the many types of anxiety disorders is based on criteria outlined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV TR). (5) Separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia are the most common childhood anxiety disorders, and social phobia (or social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in adolescence. Several anxiety disorder screening tools have been well validated for use in children and adolescents. The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) is a self-report screen for identifying anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) both have parent and self-report versions to screen for anxiety disorders in youth. These three scales are helpful for identifying youth at risk for anxiety disorders and for monitoring response to treatment. (6)Separation anxiety disorder is one of the most common anxiety disorders in school-age children. Separation anxiety is a normal stage of early development in preschoolers and during the initial few months of first attending school. It is considered a disorder if it continues past these stages or causes substantial distress for the child and family and interferes with normal functional developmental tasks. Children who have separation anxiety disorder fear something bad will happen to them or someone they love (usually parent or caregiver) when they are apart. This fear causes children to avoid being out of sight from the parent or caregiver or to have substantial distress and anxiety when they are separated or in anticipation of separation. By definition, the duration of the anxiety must be at least 4 weeks. Anxiety symptoms can manifest as physical complaints on school mornings that usually do not occur on weekend mornings or as behavior outbursts. The symptoms generally improve if the feared situation (eg, school) is avoided.Children who have separation anxiety disorder often are unable to be left with a babysitter, are not able to fall asleep on their own (parent falls asleep with them or they sleep in parents' room), and avoid school. The affected child demands substantial attention and time, which can lead to less parental time for other children in the family. Mothers usually are the caregivers demanded, which can result in a parent-child dyad that can exclude other members of the family to manage the child's anxiety. The child becomes dependent on the mother for reassurance and management of the anxiety and fear, thereby losing confidence in his or her ability to manage situations independently.Parents of children who have separation anxiety describe loss of their adult relationships and occupational consequences because at least one parent is home with the child who has not gone to school. Children who have separation anxiety disorder miss out on social opportunities with friends because they do not want to be away from their home and parents. This disorder can cause substantial distress and dysfunction for the child and family and interfere with the development of age-appropriate independence and academic success. One of the important functional impairments commonly associated with this disorder is school phobia or school refusal. (7)School refusal is described as a persistent pattern of not wanting to go to school, avoidance of school, or high distress associated with going to school. Although it is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis, school refusal can be a symptom of underlying psychiatric illness, most commonly an anxiety disorder. School refusal often is a complex problem that requires genuine understanding of individual and family factors to develop a successful treatment approach. One of the key treatment goals in school refusal derived from separation anxiety disorder is getting the child back into the school environment as soon as possible.It is important to differentiate school refusal related to anxiety from conduct problems and subsequent truancy. Youth who exhibit truancy generally do not report other symptoms of anxiety or issues of separation from parents. They are not at school, but the reason is not that they need to be with a parent or caregiver due to fear and anxiety. Truancy is characterized by a pattern of skipping school, lack of concern or embarrassment about not attending school, refusal to do any school work, and frequently hiding school absences from parents.Specific phobia is the most common type of anxiety disorder, but it often is managed by avoidance of the specific feared situation and less often presents for treatment. Many people have fears, with common ones including heights, spiders, snakes, blood, and needles. A specific phobia is fear of an object or situation that is not developmentally expected and is out of proportion to the actual danger and manifests as an anxiety response that is extreme and unreasonable (eg, avoidance or intense anxiety and panic). The specific fear must be present for at least 6 months and cause the child substantial distress or impairment in functioning to be considered a true phobia. Although many specific phobias do not come to medical attention, fear of needles in a child requiring vaccination and fear of choking with restriction of oral intake are two examples of situations requiring treatment due to associated health risks. Specific phobias sometimes are preceded by a traumatic event (such as becoming afraid of dogs after being bitten by a dog). Onset also can be associated with genetic predisposition, increased stress in the environment, and modeling behaviors in the environment (such as a parent's fear response to a situation).Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in teens, likely because of the increased importance of peers and social context in adolescent development. Youth who suffer from social anxiety disorder have severe anxiety in social situations that is extremely distressing and can lead to avoidance and substantial deterioration in overall function. Youth who have social anxiety disorder describe an overwhelming fear of drawing attention to themselves or saying something stupid or embarrassing around others, especially peers. This fear can lead to not being able to ask questions in class, not being able to talk in front of others, avoidance of the phone, not ordering in restaurants, and not using public bathrooms. Severe social anxiety disorder can result in isolation to the point of rarely leaving home, not having contact with friends, and not attending school.Generalized anxiety disorder can have its onset in childhood and adolescent years. The anxiety centers around everyday events and responsibilities in the child's life, such as school, friends, health, future, and finances, but the distress and worry are excessive, unrealistic, or unhelpful and persist for at least 6 months. Children may report feeling tense and irritable; have frequent muscle aches and pains; and experience poor sleep, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating due to the intensity and chronicity of the worried thoughts and feelings. Affected individuals may have academic performance anxiety that interferes with starting and completing assignments and taking tests due to fear of failure or that the result will not be good enough. A pattern of avoidance can develop to prevent a feared event or the youth may seek excessive reassurance from others that nothing bad will happen, leading to increased anxiety, decreased enjoyment, and avoidance of everyday activities.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder involving obsessions (distressing intrusive thoughts or images) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or rituals performed to relieve distress and anxiety associated with the obsessions) that are unwanted, cause substantial anxiety, and interfere with functioning (consuming more than 1 hour per day). The most common obsession themes are illness, contamination, and danger-related, and the most common compulsions are cleaning, washing rituals, and checking behaviors. OCD does not always involve observed compulsions, and the individual can suffer from repetitive images or thoughts (eg, of violent, religious, or sexual nature) that are extremely distressing. Children who have OCD generally have poor insight into their illness and may not recognize the obsessions and compulsions as irrational. They may have trouble going to school, find they are unable to concentrate in class, have difficulty getting out of the house or getting dressed, and have decreased food intake related to obsessions and compulsions. Parents commonly are involved in OCD routines and compulsions with children and teens, and the illness can have a substantial negative impact on family functioning.Panic disorder usually has its onset in adolescent years but can occur in children. Although not the most common anxiety disorder, this illness can become debilitating rapidly. Children who have panic attacks (Table 2) most commonly present initially to an emergency department or urgent care center because the physical symptoms are acute and escalate quickly, similar to having a heart attack, asthma attack, or even a stroke or seizure. Panic attacks can occur in any anxiety disorder or high-stress situation when the patient is presented with a feared stimulus. However, in panic disorder, the attacks occur \"out of the blue\" without clear precipitants or warning. Such unpredictability causes extreme fear and anxiety about having another attack, particularly in a place where others might see them or where escape or help might not be possible. Affected individuals avoid any situation they associate with having a panic attack as well as places where they fear that if they did have an attack they would not be able to manage it or get help. Teens who have panic disorder may stop all extracurricular activities, refuse to go anywhere without their parents, and stop going to school (or have extreme distress with school attendance).Anxiety disorder treatment in children and adolescents is one of the best-researched areas in child and adolescent mental health. Treatment of childhood anxiety includes both specific and nonspecific treatment approaches. Specific approaches are evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders and include structured psychotherapies (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Nonspecific treatments include activities that decrease stress, improve mood, and support well-being, including sleep hygiene, healthy eating, regular exercise, predictable routine, and social supports.Standard evidence-based anxiety disorder treatment guidelines recommend the use of CBT as first-line treatment for children who have anxiety disorders when this therapy is available. (8)(9) Many CBT programs and books are available, and the skills often are taught to both parents and child to support the implementation of the strategies and decrease indirect reinforcement of anxious behaviors and thinking. CBT includes psychoeducation and cognitive and behavior skills training to help individuals understand and better manage anxiety. Anxious children think catastrophically or overexaggerate the negative outcomes of situations and generate avoidant solutions, leading to significant distress and avoidance behaviors.The cognitive strategies include identifying anxiety symptoms and somatic symptoms related to anxiety, developing realistic thinking, and problem-solving. Behavioral strategies consist of relaxation and stress management techniques as well as gradual exposure to the feared situation to modify the anxiety response through systematic desensitization and habituation (Table 3). Many children experience improvement in their anxiety with CBT alone and do not require medication. In some cases, children and teens are unable to learn and use CBT strategies to manage their anxiety without pharmacologic treatment.Medications help decrease overall anxiety symptoms and panic response and should be considered if the anxiety is moderate to severe. The best evidence, supported by both meta-analyses (10) and a Cochrane review, (11) for pharmacologic treatment of childhood anxiety disorders favors the SSRIs. (9) Although some SSRIs have been approved for treating children who have depression (fluoxetine, escitalopram) and OCD (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline), SSRIs do not have United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, considerable evidence supports their efficacy. CBT in combination with an SSRI is recommended for moderate-to-severe anxiety disorders. (9)(12) Randomized, controlled trials of SSRI medications (sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) show effectiveness in treating children and adolescents who have anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11)Evidence is insufficient to recommend non-SSRI antidepressants such as venlafaxine for treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11) Strong evidence supports the efficacy of clomipramine in treatment of OCD, but the adverse effect profile does not support its use as first-line treatment. (9)(11) Benzodiazepines have been used for acute management of anxiety, but there is no evidence of their effectiveness for treatment of anxiety disorders in children. (9)(11)The risk/benefit ratio of initiating a medication trial should be considered in each situation, and the adverse effects should be disclosed fully, including the FDA black box warning for all antidepressants (the rare but increased risk for youth of experiencing suicidal ideation and behaviors while taking antidepressant medications). Initial doses should be minimal, with very gradual increases, as tolerated, according to symptom response and adverse effects, remembering that the medications take several weeks to start working and improvement continues for several months at a given dose. Although suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are not as common in childhood anxiety disorders as in depressive disorders, they may occur, and children should be monitored. (10) Medication should be viewed as helping the child decrease overall anxiety symptoms to allow success in learning and using anxiety management strategies. Given the adverse effects and risks of SSRI medication in children and the limited long-term safety data of these medications in the developing brain, medication intervention should be combined with CBT and healthy living strategies, with the goal of trying to taper the child off the medication within 1 year if he or she is doing well.Anxiety has the best chance of improving when both youth and family are educated about anxiety disorders and when there is support of the treatment plan. Numerous randomized, controlled trials support CBT and SSRIs as effective treatments for pediatric anxiety disorders. (8)(9)(10)(11)(12) The goal of treatment is to ameliorate symptoms and reduce anxiety, with improvement in overall function.",

      "abstract": "Acromegaly is a chronic condition caused by the excessive production of growth hormone and is characterized by progressive morphological and systemic complications, as well as increased prevalence of psychopathologies, which markedly affect patients' quality of life. The advancing multimodal therapies, while significantly improving the morbidity and mortality, have limited impact on psychopathologies, which often persist despite disease remission. The most common psychopathologies in acromegaly include depression, anxiety and affective disorders, together with sexual dysfunction, which may be considered as either a consequence or potentially even a contributory factor to these psychopathologies. Approximately one-third of patients with acromegaly manifest depression, whereas two-thirds of patients display anxiety, with both conditions tending to be more prevalent and severe in younger patients with shorter duration of disease. Apparently, a major impact of psychological discomfort in women compared with men appears to be the fact that women tend to internalize whereas men tend to externalize their distress. Personality disorders also commonly associated with acromegaly, especially due to body image suffering, are linked to sexual dysfunction, which seems to affect women more than men. In summary, psychopathology in acromegaly is a major determinant of the quality of life and a complex array of psychological abnormalities are associated with acromegaly.",

The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines.

      "abstract": "Without antidepressant therapy, episodes of clinical depression last from 2 months to several years, with an average of around 5 to 6 months. One-third of the patients recover within a year; probably one out of four untreated episodes may last more than 2 years. Depressive episodes occur, on the average, every 2 to 3 years. ECT and antidepressant drug therapy greatly reduce the duration of episodes and significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality of affective disorders. With modern treatment, during a 5-year follow-up, about one quarter of depressed patients had no recurrent episodes, more than half recovered in less than 2 or 3 months, and about one in seven patients developed chronic depression (episodes lasting longer than 2 years). Suicide attempts were made by one fifth of this group of patients, and 6% committed suicide. However, three-fourths of the patients were well three-fourths of the time. Age and culture seem to influence the course of depression. In addition to the classified clinical depressions, there is a considerable prevalence in the general population of depressive symptomatology and dysphoric states, apparently related to genetic factors, age, and stress. Little is known about the course and indications for treatment of these latter conditions, which should be the target for more systematic study and research in the ever widening fields of the phenomenology and therapy of depression.",

When the restriction extends to 2 weeks, it can reach levels of impairment that are comparable to 2 nights in total sleep deprivation, resulting in problems in memory consolidation, as well as impaired attention, learning and executive functioning (working memory, cognitive flexibility, self-monitoring, impulsiveness, planning and inhibition, and social cognition). Although the association between sleep restriction and memory disorders is well known, there is insufficient information regarding alterations in executive functions, specifically those of social cognition in subjects with sleep restriction. Social cognition involves those human skills necessary to successfully interact in a social environment and according to recent research, it can be affected if people cannot sleep.",

      "abstract": "Cushing’s syndrome may present with various psychiatric disorders which can lead to a misdiagnosis at the beginning, deterioration of the course of the disease and life-threatening complications. The most common psychiatric disorder is atypical depression. During the initial stages of the disease, the somatic symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome can be subtle, difficult to identify, especially when the psychiatric symptoms are dominant. Objective: The aim of the present article is to report a case of a 24-year-old woman with a Cushing’s syndrome, caused by the adrenal adenoma. The onset of the disease is a suicidal attempt. Family history is significant for psychiatry disorder. The belated diagnosis led to somatic and psychiatry complications of the disease – sepsis and persisting high suicidal risk. The dynamic change in the patient’s mental state – from a severe depressive episode with atypical symptoms to psychosis with single catatonic symptoms – correlated well with the gradual increase of the plasma cortisol levels. The antidepressant and subsequent antipsychotic medication turned out to be ineffective. The surgical treatment, followed by a normalization of the cortisol levels was a key to the successful outcome and the reduction of self-aggression risk. Conclusion: The early diagnosis and timely treatment of Cushing’s syndrome decrease the risk of multiple complications. The shift from atypical depression to psychosis with catatonic symptoms correlates with the worsening of the hormonal imbalance. The signs of atypical depression in Cushing's syndrome, resistant to the antidepressant medication, could be considered as relatively specific symptoms, guiding specialists to its somatogenic origin for the proper diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Sensory deprivation speeds up the degenerative changes normally associated with aging and enhances the loss of functional cells in the central nervous system. Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

There is clinical and experimental evidence that a patient's level of symptomatic distress is amplified by four factors as follows: the thoughts he has about his symptom, the degree to which he pays attention to it, his mood, and the situational context. These factors can be used therapeutically in maximizing palliation and symptomatic relief for patients with chronic medical diseases. Discussing the causes of the patient's symptoms can be helpful, as can strategies to maximize distraction and focus the patient's attention away from his body. Aggressive treatment of anxiety and depression is indicated in chronically symptomatic patients, and behavioral interventions to alter the family's response to the patient's symptoms can also be palliative.",

This at least is the feeling of many professionals in the field of child development in Britain, who believe that in recent years they have been seeing more children with autistic spectrum disorders. Autism was first characterised in 1943 by Kanner,1 who described a group of children with an unusual pattern of behaviour present from birth or before 30 months. He called this “early infantile autism.” His essential criteria for diagnosis were social aloofness and elaborate repetitive routines.2 Subsequent epidemiological studies have shown that autism is not, as Kanner first thought, a unique and separate condition occurring in children of otherwise normal development but that it is closely related to a range of developmental disorders.3 4 These include Asperger's syndrome,5 a condition characterised by borderline or normal IQ; social isolation or naive, inappropriate social interaction; intensive interest in only one or two subjects; a narrow, repetitive life style; limited or inappropriate intonation and body language; and poor motor coordination.\n\nAutistic spectrum disorders share a triad of impaired social interaction, communication, and imagination, associated with a rigid, repetitive pattern of behaviour. Onset is usually at birth or during the first three years of life, but problems can begin later in childhood. The triad can be recognised at all levels of intelligence and can …",

Common leading symptoms in these undiagnosed patients are: pain, rapid exhaustion, irritability and sexual problems. Depressive episodes in women are twice as frequent as in men. Furthermore, chronic diseases, chronic pain symptoms, addiction problems as well as recent, psychologically burdening events increase the risk for a depression. If anamnesis or clinical investigation are suggestive for a depression, the patient should be explored systematically with respect to his symptoms. Main symptoms of a depression are depressed mood, loss of enthusiasm and joyfulness as well as depressed motivation and increased fatigability. Further common symptoms are reduced self-confidence, unfounded self-accusations, suicidal thoughts, reduced ability to concentrate, hyperagitation or psychomotor restriction, sleeping disorders as well as loss of appetite. Since depression can be positively influenced by antidepressive drugs or suitable psychotherapeutic methods, early diagnosis by the physician is of decisive importance.",

These symptoms can include physical (e.g., pain, shortness of breath), cognitive (e.g., delirium, memory problems, impaired concentration), and affective (e.g., depression, anxiety) experiences associated with the disease and its treatments (1). Symptoms are the side effects and ''toxicities'' of treatment, as well as the direct product of the disease process itself. Symptoms are what patients report to clinicians as the subjective negative feelings of physical and mental changes produced by both disease and treatment. Symptom severity is related to the extent of disease and the aggressiveness of therapy. Common symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment significantly impair the daily function and quality of life of patients. Symptoms that are unrecognized by treatment teams may also become so severe that emergency room visits or hospitalization are required for management, adding substantially to the cost of treatment and to the disruption of the patients' routines and those of their families. Untreated symptoms may also negatively influence treatment effectiveness by interrupting treatment (2). Multiple and severe symptoms present a significant challenge to the resources of those who care for and managecancer patients. For example, intensive cancer therapies produce severe and sometimes life-threatening side effects, resulting in patients' inability to care for themselves and in total dependence on caregivers (3). Undertreatment of symptoms has become a major health problem in its own right.",

Patients have alternate increased mood and activities (mania, hypomania, or “ups” period) and declining mood and activities (depressive or “downs” period) in their life. Symptoms of the manic episodes of bipolar disorder include sensitive feelings, lack of rest, and shot up self-esteem, while the depressive episodes bring loss of interest, more or less sleep than usual, anxiety, a feeling of worthlessness, and lack of concentration. Bipolar disorder is a severe mental disorder with a fairly high prevalence of 1%- 2% and is the 5th cause of disability in the world. Many factors have been considered to contribute to this disorder. While there is strong evidence that some genetic and environmental factors are associated with bipolar disorder, only a few can provide sufficient evidence to establish causality. This report discusses the case of a new manic episode of bipolar disorder that occurs in a woman aged 25 years old who works as a public figure, announcer, and entertainer. The patient has been hospitalized several times and received various pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy but still having difficulties in managing the ups and downs of her emotion. A lot of individual factors must be considered in managing patients with bipolar disorder.",

Could Cushing's syndrome underlie this patient's psychiatric history? Or are two co-existing, intertwining causes responsible for the psychiatric symptoms?

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), parasomnia, and sleep problems associated with medical/psychiatric conditions are also common.

Consequences of CFS found include social isolation and stigmatization, physical inactivity, psychological disturb ances and a reduced quality of life. Plausible mechanism for the development of CFS is based on loss of immunological tolerance to the vasoactive neuropeptides following infection, significant physical exercise or de novo. Considerable evidence points towards a prominent role for central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CFS. Patients with CFS are described as perfectionist, conscientious, hardworking, somewhat neurotic and introverted individuals with high personal standards, a great desire to be socially accepted and with a history of continuously pushing themselves past their limits. Fewer than 20% of persons with CFS have been diagnosed and treated. Graded exercise therapy and cognitive behaviour therapy appeared to reduce symptoms and improve function based on evidence from RCTs.",

The close - knit family structure and lack of adequate government resources to support people with mental illness place the burden of care on the family which is perceived to be the ‘‘natural’’ caregiver. Socio-cultural expectations envision caregiving as an obligation and moral binding which is to be given by parents, children or the spouse. Religious-cultural attributions often causally implicate supernatural factors in the manifestation of mental illness.\r\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that usually starts in late adolescence or early adulthood, and is characterized by profound disruption in thinking, language, perception and the sense of self, and includes psychotic experiences, such as hearing voices or delusions. 6\r\nThe volatile nature of the disorder and its accompanying debilitating consequences burdens the family in multiple domains causing social, emotional and financial problems. Several studies had done worldwide reveal a high level of burden, social isolation and stigma among caregivers of schizophrenia. Indian data in this area is relatively sparse however some studies reports the presence of depression, anxiety, poor mental and physical health and other mental disorders among the caregivers. In view of the above the present study was undertaken to evaluate the quality of life and marital adjustment in spouses of schizophrenia patients.",

Dryness in this disease is predominantly of the eyes and mouth, but it is not limited to these areas and commonly occurs in the skin, respiratory tract, and vaginal lining. Patients with Sjogren’s syndrome may also suffer from shortness of breath, cough, joint pain and swelling, rashes, reflux, muscle weakness, urinary dysfunction, peripheral or central nervous system disease, thyroid disease, and even depression.

      "abstract": "Aging is a universal biologic process characterized by a progressive, predictable, inevitable evolution and maturation of an organism until death. The increasing biomedical and psychosocial uniqueness of the elderly requires an individualized approach to their care. The conventional disease-specific approach is not optimal for elderly patients for several reasons. First, people aged 75 years suffer from 3~4 chronic diseases on average. Second, many distressing symptoms or impairments among elderly patients, such as pain, dizziness, fatigue, sleep problems, sensory impairments, and gait disorders cannot be ascribed to a single disease: instead, they result from the accumulated effects of physical, psychological, social, environmental, and other factors. Third, elderly patients vary in the importance they place on potential health outcomes. Three factors at least affect the clinical presentation in elderly patients: underreporting symptoms and impairments, changes in the patterns of presentation of individual illnesses, and an altered spectrum of health conditions. Clinical decision-making is further complicated in these patients because other persons, including the spouse, grown-up children, other relatives, and significant others, are often actively involved, particularly when the patient has cognitive impairment. The physician should understand clinical perspectives of aging and clinically relevant differences between young and old patients, including how elderly individuals behave when they are ill and how to interpret a changing constellation of multiple disease possibilities and interrelationships.",

Most patients with a psychiatric disorder seen in a pain clinic will have had a preexisting psychiatric illness or will have developed mental illness because of their chronic painful illness. Depressive illness is the most common associated psychiatric disorder that is found in patients with chronic pain. The three most typical symptoms of a depressive illness are: depressed mood; loss of interest and pleasure; and loss of energy and increased fatigue. Anxiety disorders have been found to be correlated more closely than depression with chronic painful conditions in a large US sample of chronic pain patients. Panic disorder comprises severe unpredictable anxiety episodes that can occur \"out of the blue,\" although they are usually more common in one situation than another. The difficulty for the nonpsychiatric physician in examining a patient with long-standing pain is in differentiating distress from illness.",

      "title": "Psychosocial therapies in addictive disorders",
      "abstract": "Substance use disorders form a significant part of global disease burden. With the increasing trend of use of psychoactive substances, the detrimental effects associated with it also increases. Individuals with substance use disorders are heterogeneous with respect to a number of clinically important features and domains of functioning. The pathophysiology of these addictive disorders is complex, not always linear and can be described as a complex bio-psycho-social process, coordinated by the neurological, vascular and endocrine systems. Apart from these biological factors psychological, physiological, environmental, and cultural factors are also invariably associated with use of a particular substance, and may have an independent intervening effect on the patient's overall quality of life and long term outcomes. Care of individuals with substance use disorders includes conducting a complete assessment, treating intoxication and withdrawal syndromes when necessary, addressing co-occurring psychiatric and general medical conditions, the achievement of abstinence or reduction in the use and effects of the substance, reduction in the frequency and severity of relapse to substance use, and improvement in psychological and social functioning, developing and implementing an overall treatment plan. Methods of intervention for achieving the above objectives vary from pharmacological to behavioral or psychosocial and from singular specific therapies to a broad array of services within a program. The role of psychosocial interventions has been especially underutilized and under studied in this patient population. Treatment services have been developed to address not only the substance use, but also the range of other problems that often predate, co-occur with, and are caused by these substance use disorders. These issues can include family or social relationships, legal matters, job or vocational concerns, medical conditions, and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Identifying the magnitude of these problems and managing them effectively may have a significant impact on the prevention of relapse. The importance of developing best practices and clinical guidelines in this area is therefore essential. The essential concepts underlying the management of addiction and related disorders are adoption of a patient-centered framework for evaluation and treatment. As in other areas of health-care, increasing attention is now being focused on providing evidence-based care for persons with substance use disorders and in this context there has been significant progress in the development and standardization of psychosocial treatments for substance use disorders. Psychosocial treatments are now considered essential components to any comprehensive substance use disorder treatment program. Principles of evidence-based medicine may be followed in both men and women in diagnostic and treatment planning and adoption of common psychosocial management approaches for these disorders. They can be implemented individually or in groups and delivered by a range of health workers. Psychosocial treatments are considered to be the foundation of drug and alcohol treatment, especially for substances where pharmacological treatments have not been sufficiently evaluated. The highlights of this book includes a comprehensive overview of the various psychosocial assessment tools, intervention strategies, the efficacy of a community based approach as well as the use of innovative approaches such as digital technology in formulating an adequate psychosocial management approach. There is a need for research on psychological interventions in special populations such as adolescents, the geriatric population, poly drug misuser, those with medical comorbidities, people with psychiatric comorbidity and other specific groups like LGBT, the tribal population and those with physical impairments. The recent literature regarding the same has been highlighted in this book. Maintaining the ethical frame is paramount in the therapy room and this extends to any intervention research which involves human participants. The chapter on ethics examines the debates and recommendations concerning key ethical issues in research on psychotherapy and various psychosocial interventions. Healthy family interaction and regular treatment follow up with support of family has proved to be the major protective factors of abstinence after treatment. These family based interventions would promote the quality of social support to the individual and it has been documented that social support when supplemented with effective community based interventions is a crucial factor in recovery. These guidelines outline this very model and addresses the importance of training primary health care doctors, NGO staff, volunteers, counselors, college & school teachers, strengthening self-help groups like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) in case identification, diagnosis, referral to treatment, providing long term care and rehabilitation services of patients with addiction disorders.. We hope that these guidelines would help in facilitating proper management of patients presenting with various types of substance use disorders and that the information provided will be of interest and may serve as a powerful tool to healthcare professionals.",

      "title": "At risk for pain : pain-related anxiety, cognition, and processing biases",
      "abstract": "Pain is a well recognizable and familiar experience to all human beings.In most cases, pain takes the form of an acute episode that temporarily disables individuals in their daily functioning, and that cures spontaneously within a short period of time, or after effective medical treatment has taken place.Nevertheless, there is a substantial part of the population that has to contend with daily recurrent pain complaints for a prolonged period of time.Although the prerequisite for pain duration has been debated, there is now general consensus that pain complaints lasting longer than three months can be considered 'chronic'.Apart from chronic pain complaints originating from evident physical or organic causes (e.g., cancer pain), a considerable part of the chronic pain patients suffers from non-specific pain complaints.That is, they experience pain even though no objective or somatic cause can be detected, or they suffer from persisting pain complaints after the somatic cause has been effectively treated.Non-specific chronic pain is predominantly localized at the musculoskeletal system, affecting the lower back, the lower-and upper limbs (knee, elbow, leg), the neck, and the shoulders (Kerssens, Verhaak, Bartelds, Sorbi, & Bensing, 2002; Verhaak, Kerssens, Dekker, Sorbi, & Bensing, 1998).An epidemiological study in a Dutch community sample demonstrated that about 75% of the general population indicates to have experienced pain at the musculoskeletal apparatus in the past period of twelve months.Moreover, for 45% of this group, these pain complaints persisted for longer then three months (Picavet & Schouten, 2003).In another study, examining the prevalence of low back pain and associated disability in the Belgian population, 41,8% of the respondents indicated to have experienced low back pain for at least one day in the past period of six months.Moreover, for 8,2 % of this group, low back pain was seriously impeding daily functioning (Goubert, Crombez, & De Bourdeaudhuij, 2004).Although the group of chronic patients constitutes a relatively small proportion of the general population (5-10 %), this group is responsible for a large proportion of health-care costs and levels of work absenteeism in western societies (e.g., Waddell, 2004).In addition, chronic pain is known to have an enormous impact on the personal and social relations of the individual in pain (Morley & Eccleston, 2004;Sullivan, Adams, & Sullivan, 2004).Given the detrimental effect of chronic pain on the individual and his or her surrounding, research into the factors and mechanisms that contribute to the aetiology, the persistence, and the effective management of chronic pain complaints has known a significant boost in the latest decades.This burgeoning research interest has amongst others resulted in the identification of a number of psychological factors and mechanisms that may predispose persons toward, or conversely protect them against the development and persistence of chronic pain complaints.The current thesis contributes to this line of research by zooming in on the specific contribution of some of these proposed vulnerability and resilience factors.Consequently, the main and overall objective of this thesis is to add to the understanding of factors, mechanisms, and processes that constitute a mediating or moderating role in pain and pain-related disability.Before introducing the exact research questions of this thesis, this first chapter will start with a brief overview of some of the most prevalent theoretical models of pain as they have been formulated throughout history.Next, the theoretical background against which this thesis has been conducted will be presented by introducing some central concepts and factors underlying the studies in this thesis.Last and concordantly with the outline of this thesis, the main research questions of the individual studies in this thesis will be presented.",

These features create psychological needs for patients which should be responded to by an integrated basic psychosomatic care. This includes respect and empathy, patient centered communication, adequate response to negative emotions, establishment of a helpful and lasting therapeutic relationship, psychoeducation, empowerment and shared decision making. Apart from this basic psychosomatic care which can be provided by each treating physician or nurse, some conditions need more specialized psychosomatic care in the context of a multidisciplinary team: Chronic pain services, Infertility treatment teams, Sexual counselling and therapy and treatment of psychiatric comorbities or sequelae of the disease like depression, anxiety disorder etc. Psychosomatic care should thus be integrated into the biomedical diagnosis and therapy of endometriosis.",

      "title": "Clinical effectiveness of interventions for treatment-resistant anxiety in older people: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Background Anxiety and related disorders include generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and phobic disorders (intense fear of an object or situation). These disorders share the psychological and physical symptoms of anxiety, but each disorder has its own set of characteristic symptoms. Anxiety disorders can be difficult to recognise, particularly in older people (those aged over 65 years). Older people tend to be more reluctant to discuss mental health issues and there is the perception that older people are generally more worried than younger adults. It is estimated that between 3 and 14 out of every 100 older people have an anxiety disorder. Despite treatment, some people will continue to have symptoms of anxiety. People are generally considered to be 'resistant' or 'refractory' to treatment if they have an inadequate response or do not respond to their first treatment. Older adults with an anxiety disorder find it difficult to manage their day-to-day lives and are at an increased risk of comorbid depression, falls, physical and functional disability, and loneliness. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacological, psychological and alternative therapies in older adults with an anxiety disorder who have not responded, or have responded inadequately, to treatment. Data sources Electronic databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed citations, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library databases, PsycINFO and Web of Science) were searched from inception to September 2013. Bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews were hand-searched to identify additional potentially relevant studies. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for ongoing and planned studies. Review methods A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness of treatments for treatment-resistant anxiety in older adults was carried out. Results No randomised controlled trial or prospective comparative observational study was identified meeting the prespecified inclusion criteria. Therefore, it was not possible to draw any conclusions on clinical effectiveness. Limitations As no study was identified in older adults, there is uncertainty as to which treatments are clinically effective for older adults with an anxiety disorder who have not responded to prior treatment. The comprehensive methods implemented to carry out this review are a key strength of the research presented. However, this review highlights the extreme lack of research in this area, identifying no comparative studies, which is a marked limitation. Conclusions Specific studies evaluating interventions in older adults with an anxiety disorder who have not responded to first-line treatment are needed to address the lack of evidence. The lack of evidence in this area means that older adults are perhaps receiving inappropriate treatment or are not receiving a particular treatment because there is limited evidence to support its use. At this time there is scope to develop guidance on service provision and, as a consequence, to advance the standard of care received by older adults with a treatment-resistant anxiety disorder in primary and secondary care. Evaluation of the relative clinical effectiveness and acceptability of pharmacological and psychological treatment in older adults with an anxiety disorder that has not responded to first-line treatment is key future research to inform decision-making of clinicians and patients. An important consideration would be the enrolment of older adults who would be representative of older adults in general, i.e. those with multiple comorbid physical and mental disorders who might require polypharmacy. Study registration The protocol for the systematic review is registered on PROSPERO (registration number CRD42013005612).

Although many ways to assess mental health exist outside of either having a disorder or not, practitioners often rely on the presence or absence of symptomatology. The assessment and promotion of emotional regulation in patients is one way to encourage individuals to engage in mental health-promoting behaviors. Specific techniques are discussed that address emotional regulation. Overall, providing patients with the tools to regulate emotional responding will likely have a direct impact on well-being as well as reduce MH symptomology.",

Primary insomniacs have a good response to hypnotics, but feel out of control if they use them continuously. Two components are involved in maintaining the insomnia - a psychological anxiety and a physiological response to this anxiety, including raised muscle tone and respiratory rate. A behavioural regimen based on a cognitive-behavioural approach designed to improve sleep quality gradually over a period of 4 - 6 weeks is often helpful.

      "title": "Accelerated biological aging in serious mental disorders",
      "abstract": "Individuals with serious mental disorders (SMDs) die at an earlier average age, even after controlling for suicide1. They are also at increased risk for developing somatic diseases that are typically associated with advanced age, such as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, immune dysregulation and dementia1. The causes of this are likely multi-factorial, including genetic predisposition, biological changes set in motion by early life adversity, and lifestyle factors. Lifestyle factors, while obviously important, do not fully explain the increased mortality and morbidity in these individuals, and consequently, \"accelerated biological aging\" is increasingly being seen as an intrinsic factor in SMDs, at least in some individuals2, 3. To the extent this hypothesis is true, the scope of pathophysiology in these illnesses would broaden considerably, and they might no longer be framed as only \"mental disorders\" or even brain diseases, but rather as whole-body, multi-system illnesses (or at least as illnesses with substantial somatic comorbidity), of which the psychiatric presentation is just the most readily observable pathology3. Understanding the mediators of such potential acceleration of aging should expand preventative and therapeutic opportunities to improve physical as well as mental health in affected individuals. The notion of accelerated biological aging in SMDs is supported by reports of acceleration of certain biomarkers of age, such as leukocyte telomere length2 and epigenetic age4. However, data on these biomarkers remain relatively sparse to this point, and several questions arise: a) Do these markers measure aging per se, or just the presence of factors that themselves mediate aging? b) Are these markers causally related to SMDs or just correlated with them? c) Is accelerated aging specific to particular psychiatric diagnoses or to certain physiological perturbations that traverse diagnostic boundaries? d) Do different aging biomarkers reflect the same or different underlying aging processes? Here I briefly review recent data pertinent to these questions. Leukocyte telomere length and epigenetic age both significantly track chronological age, with correlation coefficients of −0.38 to −0.51 (for the former) and 0.96 (for the latter). Both of these markers significantly predict disease and mortality, strengthening the view that they are measurable markers of the aging process and of rates of aging. However, leukocyte telomere length and epigenetic age are independent predictors of chronological age and mortality risk5. Therefore, while they both measure processes that evolve with aging or are associated with aging, the specific processes are different, and their underlying mediators likely differ. Telomere shortening can occur in response to inflammation, oxidative stress, stress hormones and other factors2, 3. As such, it may signal the cumulative presence of a toxic cellular environment, rather than directly informing on the aging process itself. Indeed, leukocyte telomere length is often found to be inversely correlated with circulating inflammatory and oxidative stress factors2, 3. Another major determinant of telomere shortening is a cell's mitotic history, since telomeres fail to fully replicate after each cell division, unless acted upon by the intracellular enzyme telomerase. When cells reach a critically short telomere length, they may undergo replicative senescence, apoptosis, genomic instability or oncogenic transformation2. This can be especially problematic in tissues whose mitotic capacity is necessary for cellular replacement, such as hematopoietic stem cells and – of particular relevance to psychiatry – neuronal stem cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Of great concern (and also of great preventative opportunity), early life stress, even in utero, has been associated with shortened leukocyte telomere length in newborns and in adults. Telomeres in SMDs may progressively shorten with illness chronicity and/or severity, but, interestingly, even never-depressed girls at high genetic risk for developing depression already have short telomeres compared to girls at low genetic risk6, suggesting a genetic (or epigenetic) link to telomere shortening even before illness onset, and raising the possibility that short telomeres are a risk factor for developing certain SMDs. Telomerase has non-canonical effects unrelated to telomere lengthening, and may, in fact, have direct anti-aging, neurotrophic and antidepressant effects7. Human studies are just beginning to explore whether telomerase activation provides such benefits in humans or mediates the therapeutic effects of certain psychotropic drugs8. Epigenetic age is a more recent candidate marker of the aging process, owing largely to the discovery of an \"epigenetic clock\" by Horvath4 that remarkably tracks chronological age in humans and also predicts all-cause mortality. This \"clock\" is based on progressive age-related changes in methylation of 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) sites at specific DNA loci. While largely pre-programmed, methylation of these sites is also influenced by the environment. Considerably less work has been reported on epigenetic age in SMDs compared to leukocyte telomere length, and the findings are not entirely consistent. However, as was the case with telomere shortening, epigenetic age is apparently accelerated following life stress, perhaps even prenatal stress, and this might be related to glucocorticoid effects on methylation9. Although not strictly a biomarker of aging, another set of relevant subcellular biomarkers involves the mitochondria, which are related to the aging process, are affected by stress and glucocorticoids, interact with telomere length and telomerase, and are likely dysregulated in SMDs. Mitochondrial pathology may be assessed by mitochondrial mutations, inefficient energy generation, increased reactive oxygen species generation and altered mitochondrial DNA copy number. Although widely studied in somatic diseases, the characterization of mitochondria in SMDs is in its infancy, some results are conflicting, and the relationship of mitochondria to epigenetic age and leukocyte telomere length is actively being investigated10. In summary, the landscape of psychiatric illness is changing, with a new focus on subcellular components and processes in addition to neurotransmitters. All or nearly all of the biomarkers discussed here lack diagnostic specificity, but may, rather, be specific to particular biochemical disturbances (e.g., glucocorticoids, inflammation, oxidative stress) that contribute to psychiatric illnesses. Such studies are reinforcing the concept that purely phenomenologic diagnoses may obscure biological underpinnings of psychiatric pathology. The biomarkers discussed here are usually studied in peripheral leukocytes or in saliva. While the relationship between these peripheral markers and brain markers is uncertain, they likely have import in their own right, and may contribute to somatic as well as psychiatric presentations. A key area of investigation is to determine whether biological aging in SMDs can be decelerated with appropriate treatment. When psychiatrists and other clinicians view mental illnesses as whole body diseases, the focus will change from specific behaviors to systemic, whole body pathologies, and personalized medicine will increasingly match target-based therapies to specific biological indicators.

He was hospitalized repeatedly and over long periods for surgical complications related to his disease. He presented with “problems of adjustment” in the surgery department. We met following nine months of hospitalization, when the patient complained of acute diarrhea with severe aftereffects preventing his release home, and which the surgeons could not explain. The surgeons then asked for the liaison psychiatrist’s opinion regarding a possible psychiatric disorder.\nDiscussion: The questions posed by the surgeons and the patient’s previous history suggested a diagnosis of a painful somatic symptom disorder. The patient had been treated in parallel for depression over the previous five months. Cognitive impairment in this patient could have been linked to the sequelae of an ischemic stroke or a central nervous system disorder.\nSpecific Aspects: This patient had a severe cognitive impairment and was in a socially precarious situation. Furthermore, Sharp’s syndrome is a systemic disease that can present significant psychiatric manifestations, as in Lupus. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms related to these psychiatric disorders are poorly known, and involve inflammatory, immunological, and infectious mechanisms. In addition, this patient had significant psychiatric and somatic comorbidities. Working together, social worker and nephrologist were able to achieve appropriate overall care management of this patient.\nConclusion: Mr. T, suffering from Sharp’s syndrome, presented with a painful somatic symptom disorder. The liaison psychiatrist recommended a multidisciplinary transversal management of the patient.",

Depressive\r\nsymptoms are very much related to cognitive decline, which occur as part of neurodegenerative\r\nbrain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. Vascular brain\r\ndamage, such as stroke and white matter lesions, are associated with late-life depression as\r\nwell. Depression is also common in elderly patients with chronic disabling diseases.\r\nTh e focus of this thesis is to further assess the association between cardio- and cerebrovascular\r\ndiseases and depression in late life.",

Although some may be dramatic and worrying to parents, they do not usually mean that the child is psychologically disturbed or medically ill in any way. Very often, parasomnias stop of their own accord after a while, but safety measures may be necessary in the meantime in some of them. Occasionally, sleep disorders of this type are part of a medical or psychological disorder that needs treatment in its own right. Many parasomnias can be grouped according to when at night they occur.",

If a disease is identified generating arterial hypotension, the symptoms reported such as loss of energy, fatigue and/or depressive mood can of course be the consequence. However, asymptomatic chronic hypotension exists. Symptoms appearance in a hypotensive patient such as fatigue, loss of vital energy, alteration of quality of life must lead to look for another explanation than (chronic) low blood pressure.

      "abstract": "Introduction Koro syndrome is a culturally related disorder characterized by intense anxiety that the penis (vulva or nipples in females) is shrinking or retracting and will recede into the body. Usually it occurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, being extremely rare in western countries. The condition is more common in males and is classified within Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders. Case report A 27-year-old single man was referred to the psychiatric department. By the age of 23, he began worrying that his penis was shrinking and retracting into the abdomen. He described these thoughts as intrusive, ridiculous and repetitive. During the first months the thoughts were not very disturbing but he progressively developed an urge to verify the length of his penis several times a day. To diminish the anxiety provoked by the obsessive doubts on penis length, he started to have repetitive thoughts and mental images about sexual acts, to consume pornography compulsively and to increase his masturbatory behaviors (from some times a week to several times a day). He described those thoughts and behaviors as unpleasant and uniquely driven to reduce anxiety provoked by obsessions. He was prescribed fluvoxamine 200 mg/day and initiated cognitive behavioral therapy with good response. Y-BOCS score decreased from 30 at initial evaluation to 18 after 3 months of treatment. Conclusions Koro syndrome is a very rare condition in psychiatry in western countries, usually presenting secondarily to other psychiatric disorders. Awareness of this diagnosis and knowledge on its management are critical to provide optimal care to patients.

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of somatoform disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Somatoform disorders are characterized by the repeated subjective experience of physical symptoms (hereafter somatoform symptoms) which are not explained by any physical disease. The types of somatoform disorders in International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) are listed in Table 1. All the disorder subtypes share one common feature, that is, predominance and persistence of somatic symptoms associated with significant distress and impairment. There are repeated requests by the child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified) or family for medical investigations inspite of consistent negative findings and reassurances from medical professionals. Even if a physical disorder is present, it does not explain the nature and extent of the somatoform symptoms. These affected children often have a degree of attention-seeking behavior. They are usually diagnosed by excluding organic causes for the somatoform symptoms. Despite the absence of any physiological abnormality, these children show considerable distress and impairment.Table 1: International Classification of Diseases-10 categories of somatoform disordersThese guidelines are an update of the previous IPS guidelines on the management of pediatric somatoform disorders (2008). These guidelines are broad and are expected to help in the systematic assessment and management of a child with somatoform disorders. ASSESSMENT Difficulties in assessment [Table 2]Table 2: Difficulties in assessmentThe assessment of these disorders is not straightforward, partly because of the nature of these disorders and partly because of the nature of medical training of physicians [Table 2]. Mind–body dualism has traditionally existed in the way doctors understand medical problems. Therefore, when presented with disorders that are not properly understood because they do not conform to this dualism, physicians feel that it must be something to do with the mind (functional/psychogenic) and hence refer the patient to a psychiatrist. The message often perceived by the family is that their child is making up the symptoms. Poor liaison between the treating physician and the psychiatrist results in the family seeking multiple medical opinions. Even when the family sees a psychiatrist, they do not feel confident enough as the treating physician is not seen as competent in assessing the physical symptoms. Initial assessment [Table 3]Table 3: AssessmentOnce somatoform disorders are suspected, the assessment requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach with close monitoring of symptom evolution [Table 3]. The assessment should include thorough history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic tests to rule out both serious and benign medical factors that may be contributing to the child's symptoms. Relevant investigations should be done wherever indicated. The possibility of a somatoform disorder superimposed on neurological or medical disorders, or other psychiatric disorders should always be considered. Somatoform disorders should not be primarily diagnosed by the exclusion of an organic cause. It is much more effective to pursue a positive diagnosis of somatoform disorder when the child presents with typical features of somatoform disorders. Multiple symptoms, often occurring in different organ systems, symptoms that are vague or that exceed in number or intensity or do not conform to the objective findings are suggestive of somatoform disorders. A chronic course, prior history of unexplained physical symptoms, the presence of a psychiatric disorder, history of extensive diagnostic testing, rejection of previous physicians, and responsiveness of the symptoms to placebo or suggestion are some important pointers to the diagnosis of somatoform disorders. The treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations if there are new symptoms or there is a possibility of a somatoform disorder superimposed on neurological or medical disorders. There must be an ongoing liaison between the treating psychiatrist and the pediatrician and any new symptom should be assessed by the pediatrician. Psychosocial assessment [Table 4]Table 4: Psychosocial assessmentPsychiatric assessment should take a systemic perspective looking into all relevant biopsychosocial factors [Table 4]. These can be divided into individual factors, family-related factors, and other environmental factors. Individual factors Assessment of the child's temperament (anxious, behavioral inhibition, and harm avoidance) helps to understand how he/she copes with stress. The child's coping skills are often modeled on the family's coping skills, which also need to be understood. Assessment of intelligence to rule out borderline or low intellectual functioning can help to understand the child's coping skills in the face of stress. Low intelligence is also a risk factor for a number of psychiatric disorders. A detailed psychiatric assessment is needed to assess psychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety disorders, which may present with nonspecific physical symptoms to pediatricians or physicians. Separation fears in the child can be associated with the somatic symptoms and therefore should be properly assessed. The presence of a psychiatric condition gives a valuable clue that the child may be suffering from a somatoform disorder. Family-related factors Obtaining examples of how the family members deal with stressful situations can be very helpful. Sometimes, maladaptive ways of dealing with stressors are evident in family members, which serves as a model for the child. Exploring the family's understanding of and response to the child's symptoms is crucial to understanding the perpetuating and maintaining factors. Both lack of communication and overinvolvement with the child can maintain the symptoms of a somatoform disorder. Any secondary gain because of somatic symptoms should be carefully elicited. The style of parenting, intrafamily relationships, and family functioning need to be assessed comprehensively, focusing not only on the difficulties but also on the strengths. These strengths can be used later in therapy. It is particularly relevant to comprehensively assess for the recent or ongoing stressors which interact with the individual factors (as discussed above) to shape the course of child's problems. Studies in children have shown that stressors are generally present in their day-to-day life and are known to the child and their family members. It is important for the clinician to evaluate for stressors from a developmental perspective and to try and assess for any temporal relationship between the stressor and onset of symptoms. It may not be possible to find out stressor in the initial interviews; however, by repeated, careful, and sensitive interviewing, stressors can be elicited. Mental illness, substance abuse, physical illness, conflictual relationships in parents, and other key family members can present as both acute and ongoing stressors and therefore need to be properly assessed. History of chronic physical illness, somatoform symptoms, and disability in close family members, together with their coping mechanisms, serve as a model for the child to emulate. They can contribute to the child's problems in multiple ways. Environmental factors Environmental factors can also present as both acute and ongoing stressors in the life of the child and need to be assessed comprehensively. Stressors in school can arise from poor peer relationships, bullying, academic stress, and teaching style (harsh or critical). Acute and ongoing frightening experiences that include physical and sexual abuse also need to be assessed. Information should be obtained both from the family and school to understand the nature and extent of stressors. At times, stressors may not be obvious or severe enough to be noticed by the family members. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and their severity and temporal correlation with the onset of somatoform symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use the WHO interview schedule for the assessment of psychosocial situations (ICD-10 Axis V) for the systematic assessment of stressors in children. TREATMENT It is imperative to treat these disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. It may be helpful to consider treatment in stages with having immediate, short- and long-term goals [Table 5]. Immediate goals can be cessation of inappropriate medical interventions, ensuring the safety of the child, engaging the family in treatment, and arranging ongoing care. Short-term goals can be preventing further unnecessary medical interventions, maintaining reasonable medical monitoring, symptom reduction, and steps to initiate age-appropriate activities. Long-term goals can be appropriate use (not overuse) of medical care, resolution/minimization of symptoms and psychosocial stressors, development of appropriate coping skills to deal with psychological and environmental stressors, and resumption of age-appropriate activities. In severe cases, symptoms are unlikely to resolve completely and even if they do, they are likely to keep relapsing. Therefore, the goals may have to be revised regularly and kept realistic. Unrealistic goals often lead to symptom substitution by the child to stay in the sick role. A better goal is to help the child and family in coping with the symptoms, keeping the child engaged in school, extracurricular activities, and away from hospital admission.Table 5: Treatment goalsRapport and therapeutic alliance Once a diagnosis of one of the somatoform disorders is made, the most difficult process is engaging the child and family in the treatment plan. The cornerstones of successful therapy include establishment of rapport and therapeutic alliance with them. Resistance to seeing a psychiatrist because of various misconceptions and stigma is prevalent. The initial sessions, even while the assessment is ongoing, should aim to come to a shared formulation of symptoms that the child and family agree with. We recommend using a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) framework [Figure 1]. Family influences are particularly relevant, especially in young children, and these need to be built into the formulation.Figure 1: Cognitive behavioral therapy framework for formulating somatic problemsPsychoeducation [Table 6]Table 6: Psychoeducation - key pointsThe family and the child should be educated that physical symptoms in the absence of known physical disorder are common and representative of how the body responds to stress [Table 6]. Communicating that there is nothing seriously wrong with the child from a medical point of view is not always straightforward. The family and the child may disagree with the view that there could be anything psychologically wrong with their child, their parenting styles, or the family functioning. Any suggestion of this possibility can be met with resentment, anger, and sometimes, open hostility. It is, therefore, important to not get into an argument with the family over this. Common examples of physical symptoms in stressful situations, for example, becoming sweaty, experiencing palpitations, and feeling “butterflies in the stomach” can be quite helpful in driving home the point that physical symptoms can be present in the absence of physical disease. The best approach is to get these examples from the history narrated by the family. However, when the diagnosis is presumptive, it is best to acknowledge that rather than pretending to be certain. A better stand would be that although there is no evidence of a serious life-threatening medical illness, the child does have an impairing illness that is not properly understood. If a confident diagnosis of somatoform disorder has been made, then unnecessary medical workup should be avoided unless there are new symptoms that are not consistent with the diagnosis. However, if the diagnosis is presumptive, then the family should be reassured that the pediatrician will continue to monitor symptoms from a medical point of view. At the same time, it should be communicated that practical psychological approach can alleviate the symptoms even if the family thinks that these are due to a medical cause (that a physician has not found). An alternative formulation of symptoms is presented using the CBT framework. The child and family is educated about that while the child's symptoms may be physiological, it is their interpretation and the subsequent behaviour of the child that exacerbates them. The CBT formulation should be collaborative and prepared involving the child and family. A shared formulation helps to shift the beliefs away from a purely medical model of the child's problems. Subsequent treatment approach using the CBT model should be explained early on, and its collaborative nature needs to be stressed upon properly. It is important to arrive at shared treatment goals that are explicitly communicated between the treating clinician, the child, and family so that the members of the treating team should adopt the same approach toward the disorder and the child and family. Solving the psychosocial problems It is important to understand the psychosocial problems that may be contributing to the child's condition. Once these are known, then attempts should be made to resolve or minimize them. The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his/her opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. It is important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his/her family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child rather than on the symptoms to ensure a speedy recovery. Psychological treatment [Table 7]Table 7: Nonpharmacological management - key pointsCBT-based approaches have been shown to be helpful in reducing the intensity of symptoms and help the child in coping with them and improve his/her general functioning [Table 7]. CBT formulation is useful in understanding the symptoms regardless of whether formal CBT is used in the treatment or not. In mild cases, the formulation itself may be therapeutic. However, where symptoms are chronic, recurring, and disabling, formal CBT is recommended. The following are the key points: 8–16 weekly sessions following the general CBT framework A shared formulation to understand the child's problems Using active CBT techniques, the dysfunctional beliefs are gently challenged and replaced by the adaptive ones Gradually replace illness behavior with more healthy behaviors Negotiate a phased return to school and other extracurricular activities that the child was pursuing before. Incorporating some physical activity can be especially useful. It helps the child to improve fitness, build self-esteem, and replace the time spent on illness behaviors. It can also serve as a behavior experiment that proves that the child is not too physically unwell Combine relaxation training, yoga, problem-solving, social skill training, and mindfulness to the child. Family therapy can be useful if there is evidence that dysfunctional family dynamics are contributing to the child's difficulties. It can also be helpful if there are strengths in the family setup that can be used therapeutically. Secondary gains Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself/herself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Third, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding the secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be accompanied by providing the child with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role in which he or she can be rewarded for doing something positive. Pharmacological treatment There is no good-quality evidence to recommend any particular medication for somatoform disorders in the pediatric population. A recent Cochrane review (Kleinstäuber et al.) concluded that there is low or very low-quality evidence for the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for somatoform disorders in adults which makes it difficult to extrapolate those findings to the pediatric population. Medications including SSRIs and SNRIs have been used and reported to be helpful in somatoform disorders, especially when symptoms are particularly severe, resistant to psychological approaches, and when other psychiatric comorbidity is present. Anxiety and depressive disorders may be associated with somatoform disorders, and these respond well to antidepressants. However, it is advised that only those antidepressants which are approved in pediatric age group for other indications should be used if required. The clinician should pay particular importance to the side effects while choosing medication, as this patient group is more sensitive to them. One should start with low doses and increase them progressively to avoid side effects that may mimic the symptoms present before the treatment. Dealing with negative emotions These patients and the families often arouse negative responses in medical professionals and hospital staff. The staff can feel frustrated and angry. There can be beliefs that these patients and families are abusing healthcare resources, wasting the professionals’ time, and that no intervention will help. The psychiatrist needs to both deal with these negative emotions himself/herself and help other treating team members including the pediatrician, in coping with them.

      "abstract": "For many chronic pain patients the steady aches, burning, numbness, twisting, and stabbing sensations result in a severe loss of self-esteem, loss of interpersonal relationships, decline of family activities, curtailment of employment, and progressive loss of income. Chronic pain has been considered a natural and unfortunate side effect which accompanied a primary illness or accident. Work injuries and motor vehicle accidents account for over 80% of the beginning nightmares for the chronic pain patient. Chronic pain has multiple causes, each of which raises the stress dimension and impacts a patient's life. However, the nonanatomic distribution of the pain and associated tenderness is one of the factors that may identify it as chronic pain. Chronic pain is accompanied by stress and distress which lead to chronic disease. In 1936 Dr. Selye discovered the general adaption syndrome in which all stress producers, such as physical, chemical, and psychological damaging agents, will provoke a reproducible nonspecific body response.",

      "title": "The potential of plasma exchange in treating Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and long <scp>COVID</scp>: Targeting autoimmune and inflammatory mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and long COVID have increasingly gained attention in both medical research and public discourse due to their profound impact on patients' quality of life and the frustrating lack of effective treatments. CFS is a debilitating condition characterized by extreme, unexplained fatigue that persists for at least 6 months and is not alleviated by rest.1 This condition often leads to a substantial reduction in daily activities, making it difficult for individuals to maintain work, social, and personal responsibilities. On the other hand, long COVID refers to the persistence of symptoms following the acute phase of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, with fatigue being one of the most common and distressing features. In addition to fatigue, long COVID patients often report a range of other symptoms such as brain fog, shortness of breath, joint pain, and autonomic disturbances, further complicating their recovery and daily functioning.2 The pathophysiology of both conditions remains poorly understood, with ongoing research attempting to unravel the underlying mechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that immune dysfunction, endothelial injury, and autonomic dysregulation may play central roles in the development and persistence of symptoms in both CFS and long COVID.2, 3 These physiological abnormalities are thought to contribute to the chronic fatigue, cognitive impairments, and multisystem involvement observed in affected patients. Blood biomarkers such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10, S100B, and P-selectin may show alterations in patients with long COVID or CFS; however, the specific biomarkers linked to symptoms and their roles in disease progression are not yet fully understood. Due to the absence of definitive biomarkers and a clear understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms, treatment options are currently limited and primarily aimed at managing symptoms rather than addressing the root causes of these conditions. Given the multifaceted nature of these conditions, a treatment that targets immune, endothelial, and metabolic factors simultaneously may be required (Figure 1). TPE represents a novel and potentially promising therapeutic approach for CFS and long COVID, especially in patients who exhibit signs of immune dysregulation. By removing circulating autoantibodies, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and other factors that may contribute to the persistence of symptoms, TPE could help alleviate the chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, and autonomic dysfunction that are hallmarks of these conditions. This treatment holds potential for improving quality of life in patients who have not responded to conventional therapies. However, further research is critical to clarify its overall efficacy, determine which patients are most likely to benefit, and establish standardized treatment protocols that can guide its clinical use. Randomized controlled trials, such as the one initiated by Preßler H et al.,3 are essential to validate the role of TPE in the management of CFS and long COVID. These studies will provide the necessary evidence to incorporate TPE into a multidisciplinary treatment strategy for these challenging and often debilitating syndromes. Therefore, if apheresis treatment is employed for these conditions, it is crucial to publish the outcomes in the form of case reports or case series until more clinical trial evidence becomes available. The authors have disclosed no conflicts of interest.",

      "abstract": "<i>Background:</i> Social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia) is characterized by extreme fear, avoidance, or both of one or more social or performance situations, such as making a presentation, meeting new people, or eating in front of others. This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is an incredibly common symptom in medical settings. In the Office of National Statistics Survey 2000 (1), a degree of limiting fatigue was reported by 27% of working-age adults. Although it is claimed that about three-quarters of these patients in primary care go on to develop chronic symptoms, this is at odds with the reported point prevalence of only up to 3%. The vast majority of this fatigue falls within the 'medically unexplained' (2) category yet does not meet the diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Even those that might do are often not diagnosed as such by physicans (3). As Ranjith ((4), this issue) demon- strates, there are several sets of different diagnostic criteria that make this difficult area even more complex. A primary agreement seems to be the requirement for the fatigue to have lasted for 6 months or more and to be associated with a substantial degree of impairment. It is this impairment that is the primary reason for occu- pational health involvement. Further symptoms must co- occur with the fatigue over the 6 month period (impaired memory or concentration, sore throat, tender glands, aching or stiff muscles, post-exertional fatigue, multi-joint pain, unrefreshing sleep and new headaches), although the actual number required fluctuates. Other clinically important physical causes preclude diagnosis, as do underlying serious psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia. The common co-morbidity with anxiety and depression does not rule out the diagnosis and has complicated research, treatment and policy. A lot of published work covers either less severe conditions or those with shorter duration. These con- ditions receive labels such as 'chronic-fatigue like syndrome' or 'idiopathic chronic fatigue'.

Continuous symptomatology, brain matter loss, cognitive deterioration, excess somatic comorbidity, and premature mortality are seen throughout the life span.

Here, we shall refer to conditions with long-lasting and disabling symptoms, not trivial or passing symptoms. Such conditions are called medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Syndromes with specific diagnostic criteria, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome, are often included among MUS conditions.2\n\nAlthough management of patients with MUS presents several challenges, GPs accept the responsibility for investigation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.5\n\nBiopsychosocial approaches are commonly applied in medical practice, whether the aim is full recovery or coping with symptoms and disability,1 and psychologically based interventions (especially different cognitive behavioural therapies [CBT]) have been developed for coping and symptom relief. Yet, such approaches do not substantiate MUS as a mental disorder. Lamahewa et al found, for example, that comorbidity with depression and generalised anxiety disorder occurred in only one-third of these patients.2 Studies have evaluated effects of CBT on different outcome measures, such as pain, function, work ability, or healthcare use, often presenting limited or no significant effects based on weak evidence.4\n\nMUS is not a clinical diagnosis but an analytical concept, unifying a diverse group of health problems where no joint cause or biomarker have been identified.

Patients with psoriasis may suffer from pain and discomfort from the disease as well as psychological and social difficulties including stigmatization, embarrassment, and social inhibition. Anxiety, depression, smoking, and alcohol abuse have been found to have a higher prevalence among psoriasis patients than healthy controls. These comorbidities have also been found to have a directly negative impact on psoriasis. Awareness of the relationship between psoriasis, psychiatric disorders, and substance abuse is important for dermatologists, as these comorbidities can lead to poor compliance and treatment outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Summary Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric illness due to damage of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. The lifetime prevalence rate of OCD is about 2.5% of the population. The rates in men and women are equal. The mean age of onset is in the mid-to-late twenties to early thirties, and it is slightly earlier in males´ population. OCD has two fundamental phenomenological characteristics: repetitive urges of thoughts or actions which patients experience as coming from their own mind but as alien to their will; and surges of unbearable anxiety which accompany either resistance to these compulsions or exposure to objects or thoughts which trigger the repetitive behaviour or cognitions. The cultural influence on the content of the obsessions has been noted in the epidemiological studies. The familial nature of OCD has been observed since several years and recent studies have provided limited evidence for the importance of genetic factors in the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Recent studies suggest gender-related clinical differences in the obsessive-compulsive disorder. The most prevalent obsession is concerned with contamination by dirt and/or germs. Washing is the accompanying compulsion and such patients may spend several hours daily washing their hands or cleaning their clothes. There are two main approaches to the treatment of OCD: psychological treatment and pharmacological treatment. Antidepressants afford a successful treatments for OCD but only those with potent effects on the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems appear to have antiobsessional efficacy.",

      "title": "Depression precedes development of dementia",
      "abstract": "Dementia and depression are common disorders in old age. Dementia typically manifests itself as a neurodegenerative disease that affects cognitive functions such as memory, orientation and speech. Dementia is common in old age and its frequency increases from 1% in 65 year olds up to 50% beyond 90 years. Depression usually appears as an episodic disease which extends in length from a few weeks up to many years. The core symptoms of depression include depressed mood, loss of interests and pleasure and loss of will to live. Cognitive disorders may accompany depression and are considered separate from dementia, and were thus named pseudo-dementia, presuming that these cognitive disorders will disappear as the depressed mood will remit. Lately it has been documented that depression may precede dementia, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. Although correlation never proves causation we discuss three possibilities, not mutually exclusive: 1) Certain brain changes may manifest first as depression and later as dementia. 2) Depression and dementia have partially overlapping biological causes. 3) Certain biological changes associated with depression may lead to dementia. Dementia and depression show many common biologic features such as white matter changes in the brain, reduction of hippocampus volume, changes in the serotonergic and noradrenalinergic systems and abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",

In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

      "abstract": "Somatisation as such is not a psychiatric diagnosis, but is a common denominator of a number of disorders described by the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) as somatoform disorders. Somatform disorders are diagnosed by the presence of body symptoms that suggest a physical disorder without a demonstrable organic cause or known physiological mechanism that fully explains them and by the reasonable presumption that these symptoms are related to psychological factors or stress. Patients with chronic, serious somatoform disorders (mainly somatisation disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, and psychogenic pain) also present with personality disorders that determine the evolution or are even the main diagnosis. In addition, these patients frequently present/display severe psycho-social stress when they go to the doctor and have social adjustment problems, which often reinforce the symptoms. The gains derived from the disease and the role the patient assumes, the anomalous cognitive-perceptive mechanisms and the doctor-patient relationship are all essential for the understanding of the configuration process of many somatoform disorders and for determining their treatment. Primary care doctors therefore should be aware of and consider somatisation disorders in their clinical practice because many of the patient's symptoms could be an expression of their emotional difficulties that summarize complex psychological, life, family and social interactions, that may jeopardize the doctor-patient relationship.",

      "title": "[Induced abortion: shock and after-effects?].",
      "abstract": "It is generally agreed that the incidence of serious psychic side effects after abortion is very low. Most women undergoing abortion appear to experience nothing more than temporary depression that spontaneously resolves, and some surveys suggest that the psychic state may be improved under some circumstances after abortion. A minority of women, however, suffer considerably after abortion and their experiences, as elsewhere in psychopathology, shed light on the less obvious experience of other women. The author uses case studies to illuminate the dynamic and subconscious effects of abortion, which are revealed in attitudes, symptoms, or comments. Whether or not a woman seeks an abortion, the very fact of carrying an unwanted child can be enough to provoke psychic symptoms. If the partner abandons the woman because of her pregnancy, the blow may be even more strongly felt, resulting in a mixture of pain and aggression. The symptoms and the connection with a past abortion may remain unrecognized until a subsequent, desired pregnancy. Symptoms after an abortion may include frigidity, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pain, or poor tolerance of contraception desired at the conscious level. The manifestations are not specific and may occur after childbirth or at any other time. No matter how well accepted abortion seems to be by society, it is different from any other surgical procedure and it may therefore have some aftereffects. Social acceptance may provide some comfort but it is not enough to compensate for personal conflicts. Sometimes the conflict is expressed in the sexual relationship with the partner, who is considered responsible for the abortion. The effects of an abortion on a relationship depend in part of how satisfactory the relationship was before the pregnancy. Repeated requests for abortion may result from a woman's intrapsychic conflicts. It is well known that the desire to be pregnant is not always accompanied by a desire for motherhood. Pregnancy may be an expression of narcissistic need or a means of defense against feelings of unworthiness or doubts about identity. Guilt feelings may be increased by ambivalence about the abortion, by religious beliefs, or even by the desire for children at a later time. Feelings of guild over an abortion are often provoked by society. The practitioner can play an important role in identifying women at risk of serious psychic sequelae by listening attentively to their manifestations of ambivalence and distress.",

The mood disorders we will discuss are: depression or unipolar depression, manic-depression or bipolar disorder, dysthymic disorder, and cyclothymic disorder. There are two major types of depression. In the first, depression or unipolar depression, the patient’s mood varies between being either normal or depressed; he or she never becomes excessively elated. In the second, manic-depression or bipolar illness, the patient’s mood varies between being depressed (as in unipolar depression) and being “high” or “euphoric.”",

We do not fully understand what causes cluster headaches and there are several theories out there. Considered at this point an incurable deep brain neurological pain syndrome, however research has been seriously lacking throughout it’s history and with more research will ultimately give us a much better understanding of the condition. The hypothalamus and activation of it’s surface gray matter is part of this and CH is a circadian disorder and the circadian body clock is the hypothalamus also involving the sphenopalatine ganglion. CH is repetitive and when attacks come normally if episodic CH vs being triggered, attacks can happen at the exact same time every day, night or day, however night time attacks seem to be more common with the disorder. Attack cycles starting at the same time every year or every few years also possibly more than one attack cycle per year is not uncommon with varying cycle lengths lasting commonly weeks to months. The chronic form of the disorder with 2 to 8 or more attacks daily and or nightly lasting a full year with no more than 30 days of relief is the precise definition. The pain is located on one side of the head behind, in or around one of the eyes effecting the temple and head on that same side as well as severe neck pain and stiffness in the shoulders also painful. The intense violent stabbing pain will last between 15 minutes to 3 hours and may be accompanied by redness of the eye with excessive tearing, nasal congestion or runny nose, swelling of the eyelid, forehead or facial sweating, severe restlessness, agitation and some case sensitivity to light. Analogies of this extremely severe pain have been described as feeling like a hot poker being inserted into the eye, a knife being pounded in and out of the eye and temple, an ice pick being shoved into the eye into the brain, etc.",

They also are more susceptible to severe diseases such as cancer and pneumonia due to a weakened immune system. Mental disintegration may also occur, leading to Dementia or Alzheimer's disease.

But, as time passes we suddenly realize that the number of remaining years is limited. The realization that we are growing old can be traumatic. Our ideas about and attitudes toward aging are very important in how well we cope with and enjoy the passing years, Some psychological characteristics of aging get passed down from generation to generation through our genes. Others can result from real or perceived changes in our bodies as we age (e.g., mental or physical limitations). Social and cultural differences also affect how we deal with aging. Men and women think about aging differently, because of biological, social, and psychological differences between the sexes.

Are anxiety and depression entirely separate disorders which may co-exist in the same patient? Does anxiety give rise to the depression? Does depression give rise to the anxiety? Are anxiety and depression manifestations of a single underlying disorders, dysphoria? Therapeutic responsivity to specific drugs suggest: relief of anxiety may reveal an underlying depression; anxiety syndromes which fail to respond to anxiolytics may respond to antidepressants; short-term relief of depression may occur at times with anxiolytics. Proposed mechanisms of action of depression and anxiety also involve overlap of the elements and systems involved. The basic sensations of pain, anticipation, depression and euphoria alone or in combination are sufficient to account for the dysphoric feelings and emotions when these sensations are associated with specific mental content. These may be related in turn to biogenic amines, beta-endorphins, diazepam receptors and possibly cocaine receptors.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders refer to a spectrum of conditions that interfere with regular sleep patterns. One of the most frequently reported clinical issues is sleep disturbance. Physiological, neurological, social, and mental well-being can be critically affected by insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Overall, health and quality of life can be impacted by sleep disorders. Mental health and sleep share a significant relationship. It has long been acknowledged that individuals with mental health disorders frequently experience sleep issues. The predominant theory has been that sleep issues are basically signs of the psychiatric disorders that they are interrelated with. The fact that sleep issues are defining characteristics of a number of psychiatric disorders and are included in the diagnostic criteria for these conditions supports this aspect. However, sleep and mental health problems are associated further in diverse ways. Emerging research evidence suggests that the relationship between mental health problems and sleep disorders is complex and includes bi-directional causation, in contrast to the long-held view of this relationship that considered sleep issues as symptoms of psychiatric disorders. An increased prevalence of mental/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among certain others, is reported among patients with insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and narcolepsy, suggesting sleep disorders as a risk factor for mental health disorders. Although much has been established about the relationship between impaired mental health and sleep, further research is required to elaborately comprehend this relationship. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the relationship between sleep disorders and mental health.",

Neuropsychological symptoms frequently occur, most often manifesting as a mood disorder, anxiety disorder, cognitive dysfunction, delirium, or psychosis. Additionally, patients with SLE are commonly treated with steroid medications that are psychoactive and capable of producing varied symptoms from euphoria to psychosis. Mental symptoms are very common, often appearing early in the course of this disease, but they are possible at any time. There are a great many possible physical manifestations of SLE, depending on the organ systems that are affected. SLE may present as an acute illness with a fever, or it may come on insidiously over years with episodes of low-grade fever and malaise. Systemic lupus erythematosus may be difficult to diagnose. The course of the illness varies considerably, but generally patients experience periods of exacerbation and remission.",

Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

The chronic fatigue syndrome also presents problems in definition and measurement, is associated with even more morbidity than chronic fatigue itself, and is often controversial. Particularly unclear is the way in which chronic fatigue and the chronic fatigue syndrome relate to each other: Is one the severe form of the other, or are they qualitatively and quantitatively different? We know that many things can cause chronic fatigue, and this is probably true for the chronic fatigue syndrome, too. We can anticipate that discrete causes of the chronic fatigue syndrome will be found in the future, even if these causes are unlikely to fall neatly along the physical–psychological divide that some expect. The causes of chronic fatigue are undoubtedly many, both in a population and in any individual person, even when a discrete cause, such as depression or cancer, is identified. Social, behavioral, and psychological variables are important in both chronic fatigue and the chronic fatigue syndrome. Interventions that address these general variables can be successful, and currently they are often more successful than interventions directed at specific causes.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews recent literature which suggests that sleep disturbance in members of the general population, whether or not they have ever had a formal psychiatric disorder, is a risk factor for the onset of a formal psychiatric diagnosis at a later time. Based upon the current literature, the strongest link is between subjective insomnia, lasting at least 2 weeks, and the later onset of depression. Less well-established data suggest that lifetime reports of at least 2 weeks of insomnia, hypersomnia, or both hypersomnia and insomnia, are risk factors for the later development of depression, anxiety disorders or substance abuse. More tentatively, preliminary data suggest that increasing subjective sleep disturbance may signal a relapse in remitted depressed patients. Sleep disturbances are common manifestations of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Therefore, sleep complaints may be among the most robust prodromal symptoms reflecting partial depressive or anxiety disorders, which eventually declare themselves as full-blown clinical episodes.",

      "abstract": "Back pain in the working age population can coincide with work-related activities and may lead to temporary or permanent work disability in the case of functional impairment that interacts with workplace demands. This can lead to economic if not existential problems for the affected individual. Although neurogenic or inflammatory back pain may be the cause, the big majority of all cases is caused by \"common\" low back pain with or without irradiating pain, the main problem being frequent recurrencies of acute pain episodes (periodic or relapsing course). After early exclusion of specific causes (i. e. \"red flags\": usually identified through history and simple laboratory findings!) repetitive examinations should be avoided. Structural changes and physical job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistent impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). Longtime workplace absence has important individual and socioeconomic consequences. The risk for chronification can be estimated through evaluation of \"yellow flags\" and observation of characteristics of the course in the individual case. An early return to work and to activities of daily life is urgent. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation or social and occupational reintegration should be organised.Rückenschmerzen im Erwerbstätigenalter zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie einerseits im Zusammenhang mit Arbeitstätigkeiten auftreten können, andererseits im Falle der Beeinträchtigung von Körperfunktionen mit den Arbeitsaufgaben interagieren können und so zur vorübergehenden oder andauernden Beeinträchtigung der Arbeitsfähigkeit führen können. Dies kann ökonomische, unter Umständen auch existentielle Probleme zur Folge haben. Obwohl auch neurogene und entzündliche Ursachen in Frage kommen, stellen die „banalen“ Rückenschmerzen mit und ohne Ausstrahlung die überwiegende Mehrzahl der Fälle dar. Ein Hauptproblem stellt sich aufgrund der hohen Rezidivneigung („periodischer Verlauf“). Nach frühzeitigem Ausschluss spezifischer Ursachen („rote Flaggen“: Anamnese und einfaches Labor meist ausreichend!) sind wiederholte Abklärung zu vermeiden. Strukturelle Veränderungen und physische Arbeitsbelastungen als Ursachen dürfen nicht überbewertet werden. Dagegen spielt in der Frühphase eine geeignete Information und Medikation, bei anhaltender Funktionsstörung eine aktive Behandlung (Verläufe über 3 Wochen oder Rezidive) im Vordergrund. Langzeitverläufe haben erhebliche individuelle und sozioökonomische Konsequenzen. Das Chronifizierungsrisiko kann mittels „gelber Flaggen“ und Verlaufscharakteristika erkannt werden. Eine möglichst rasche Rückkehr zu Alltagsaktivitäten ist vordringlich. Bei Risiko für chronische Verläufe und/oder Eingliederungsproblemen sind eine interdisziplinäre arbeitsbezogene Rehabilitation oder sozialberufliche Eingliederung zu forcieren.",

      "title": "Sleep and Biological Clocks",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human behavioral and physiological processes are under the dual control of circadian rhythmicity and sleep‐wake homeostasis. In mammalian species, the underlying mechanism for the generation of most circadian rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Sleep‐wake homeostasis is an hourglass‐like mechanism relating sleep propensity and intensity to the duration of prior wakefulness. Studies under “constant routine conditions” have facilitated the detection of circadian and sleep regulation and have delineated the temporal variations over the 24‐hr day of subjective alertness (or its antonym, subjective sleepiness), cognitive performance (i.e. objective alertness), and mood, as well as endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular function. Subjective and objective alertness vary in parallel, with detectable decreases starting around the usual bedtime until a minimum is reached in the early morning hours, and then increase during the daytime hours. Decreased sleep quality and sleep loss due to voluntary behavioral alterations or to pathological conditions are associated with disturbances of a variety of neurobehavioral, physiological parameters, as well as of subjective alertness, mood, and cognitive performance. Aging is commonly associated with pronounced alterations of both the homeostatic process and the circadian pacemaker. Strategies to improve sleep quality may have beneficial effects on mental and physical well‐being.",

Although the former group is by far the larger, very little is known about the characteristics of those stalkers. The mentally disordered group comprises mainly those with erotomanic delusions, presenting either as a primary illness or secondary to another mental illness. The impact of stalking on victims is enormous - many develop post-traumatic stress disorder, contemplate suicide and suffer immense disruption to their lives. A sizeable portion of stalking victims are subjected to physical and/or sexual assault. Anti-stalking laws are usually ineffective against erotomanic stalkers, but may be more effective in deterring non-disordered stalkers. The efficacy of treatment for mentally disordered stalkers is mixed - in some cases the illness resolves completely while in others it persists unabated, often for decades.",

      "title": "Uncomplicated depression is normal sadness, not depressive disorder: further evidence from the NESARC",
      "abstract": "We write to update the results of our recent paper 1 suggesting that uncomplicated depressive episodes are not in fact disorders and should be excluded from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). We also address some concerns expressed about our claims. The concept of \"uncomplicated depression\" is essentially a generalization to all stressors of the \"bereavement exclusion\" that appeared in DSM-IV (and was eliminated in DSM-5). Uncomplicated depression is defined as a response to a stressor that satisfies current DSM-5 five-symptoms-for-two-weeks criteria for MDD but is better explainable as a normal distress response, as evidenced by the fact that it lasts no longer than six months and does not include any of the following pathosuggestive symptoms: marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, and psychomotor retardation. Uncomplicated episodes thus contain only depressive symptoms common in general distress reactions (e.g., sadness, moderate withdrawal or role impairment, decreased interest in usual activities, insomnia, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, fatigue). In our recent paper 1, using longitudinal data from the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study 2, we found that in those with lifetime uncomplicated MDD at baseline, the one-year recurrence rate (3.4%) was not significantly different from the background MDD incidence rate in those who never previously had MDD (1.7%), but both were dramatically lower than recurrence rates in other (\"complicated\") MDD (14.6%). Thus, in terms of recurrence risk, uncomplicated MDD is different from other MDD but indistinguishable from no-MDD-history. We concluded that \"consideration should be given to eliminating uncomplicated episodes as a class from MDD diagnosis\". However, that study had several limitations. We 3 therefore replicated and broadened the analysis using an entirely different, more recently collected longitudinal community data set – the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 4) – that allowed a more clinically meaningful 3-year follow-up window and use of an expanded set of three clinically important validators (depression recurrence, suicide attempt, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)), as well as other advantages in measuring impairment and clinical significance. Due to data-set limitations, only single-episode uncomplicated cases could be evaluated in this study. The results were that people with single-episode uncomplicated major depression had rates during follow-up of MDD recurrence (6.9%), GAD (4.3%), and suicide attempt (0.1%) that were not significantly different from background rates for those who never had MDD (6.1%, 2.7%, and 0.3%, respectively), but were dramatically and significantly lower than rates for both single-episode complicated cases (19.5%, 7.8%, and 0.8%, respectively) and multiple-episode cases (27.1%, 11.2%, and 1.7%, respectively) 3. The results were not explainable by group differences in severity or treatment rates. Given the replication's success, we concluded that uncomplicated MDD is a benign condition that is typologically distinct from the rest of MDD, thus supporting our earlier thesis that uncomplicated MDD is in fact a form of normal sadness. However, in a commentary on the replication, Maj 5 expressed some concerns about the evidence provided by our study. These previously unaddressed concerns are now considered. In MDD, the quality of remission, and especially the number of residual depressive symptoms, is important both because subthreshold depression is harmful in itself and such symptoms predict recurrence and may indicate a latent pathology. Yet, Maj notes, our studies did not report the residual symptom levels among those not experiencing MDD during the follow-up. To address this concern, we analyzed the average number of MDD symptom groups experienced during follow-up by individuals in each of our baseline MDD groups who did not have recurrences during the follow-up period. In each of the four baseline wave 1 lifetime MDD history groups, the mean number of residual symptom groups experienced by those who had no wave 2 recurrences during the 3-year follow-up period was: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.35-0.39) for the no lifetime MDD history group (N=25,514); 0.49 (95% CI: 0.34-0.65) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=379); 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.85) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=1,756); and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.91-1.10) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=1,876). Thus, there is not a significant difference in the number of symptoms during follow-up between the no-MDD-history group and the uncomplicated single episode MDD group. There is no \"residual symptom\" problem indicating implicit pathology or risk of recurrence among the uncomplicated group above the non-MDD baseline. In contrast, the complicated single episode and multiple episode groups both experienced significantly higher residual symptom levels than the no-history and uncomplicated single episode groups. In sum, recovery in uncomplicated depression generally returns to population baseline levels of depressive symptoms, which is unlike the recoveries of those with other MDD. Maj 5 also argued that the 3-year follow-up may have been too short to detect recurrences in uncomplicated cases because recurrence after recovery can occur after longer intervals. He noted, for instance, that in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study, the median time to first recurrence of MDD in people who had fully recovered from their index episode was over 4 years 6. However, the baseline NESARC data used in our study were lifetime MDD data at interview 1. Thus, the duration of the follow-up was not just three years. In fact, many of the individuals classified with lifetime MDD at wave 1 had not had their last MDD episode for some years prior to the wave 1 interview, so the average time interval since recovery was potentially much greater than three years. Thus, to address Maj's concern, we calculated for each of our MDD groups the average time from the end of the last episode to the wave 1 interview to obtain a more accurate approximation of the time intervals from the last episode to the outcome reported for wave 2. The mean years of remission prior to wave 1 assessment for each group were: 9.1 (95% CI: 7.9-10.3) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=417); 9.1 (95% CI: 8.6-9.6) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=2128); and 3.9 (95% CI: 3.6-4.2) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=2501). Thus, the average time from the end of the last episode to the beginning of the wave 2 follow-up period was lengthy, about nine years for both uncomplicated and complicated single-episode cases and about four years for multiple episode cases. This substantial time interval is more than enough for elevated recurrence rates to emerge during the examined 3-year window, and such elevated rates did occur for the single-episode complicated cases but not for the uncomplicated cases at the same 9-year average time since the baseline episode. Our recent replication and extension 3 of our earlier results 1 supports the predictive validity of the uncomplicated versus complicated depression distinction across stressors, supplementing a previous study supporting concurrent validity 7. A course with elevated recurrence relative to population baselines is generally considered the single most salient identifying feature of depressive disorder versus normal sadness 8 and a primary rationale for inferring underlying dysfunction 9, yet no such elevation occurs for uncomplicated depression. The evidence thus supports two conclusions. First, uncomplicated depression is not similar to, and is typologically distinct from, major depressive disorder. Second, given the lack of differences between uncomplicated depression and no history of MDD in crucial negative sequelae including recurrence, suicide attempt, and GAD, uncomplicated depression is best interpreted as an intense normal emotional episode. The additional analyses presented here in response to Maj's 5 concerns regarding quality of recovery and duration of follow-up substantially strengthen the support for these conclusions. Jerome C.

      "abstract": "Depression and anxiety frequently coexist in the same individual, either concurrently or at different times, and numerous studies show that the presence of an anxiety disorder is the single strongest risk factor for development of depression. When the two coexist simultaneously, either as diagnosed disorders or subsyndromal states, they may be viewed as mixed anxiety–depression or as comorbid syndromes, i.e. separate disorders occurring concurrently. Controversy continues over the nature of the relationship between depression and anxiety, some believing they are distinct, separate entities while others – now the majority – view them as overlapping syndromes that present at different points on a phenomenological and/or chronological continuum, and share a common neurobiology, the degree of overlap depending on whether each is described at the level of symptoms, syndrome or diagnosis. Community data likely underestimate true prevalence, since affected individuals frequently present in primary care with somatic, rather than psychological, complaints. Irrespective of the nature of the relationship, patients with both disorders experience significant vocational and interpersonal impairment, and more frequent recurrence, with greater likelihood of suicide, than individuals with single disorders. Various classes of antidepressant drugs offer symptom relief for these patients, the most selective of th SSRIs holding the greatest promise for sustained clinical improvement. Yet, the crucial parameter of successful pharmacotherapy seems to be the length of treatment, ensuring enhancement of the compromised neuroprotective and neuroplastic mechanisms. Further clarification of the relationship is a prerequisite for offering effective treatment to the many patients who experience lifetime depression and anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fatigue is a symptom whose causes are protean and whose phenotype includes physical, mood, and behavioral components. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness that has strong biological underpinnings and no definite etiology. Diagnostic criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have helped classify CFS as an overlap of mood, behavioral, and biological components. These include the presence of fatigue for more than 6 months associated with a diminution of functional activity and somatic symptoms, and pain not attributable to a specific diagnosis or disease. Four of the following criteria need to be present: sore throat, impaired memory or cognition, unrefreshing sleep, postexertional fatigue, tender glands, aching stiff muscles, joint pain, and headaches. Many researchers have observed that CFS shares features in common with other somatic syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Correlations between inflammation and infection, augmented sensory processing, abnormalities of neurotransmitters, nerve growth factors, low levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, abnormalities of homeostasis of the stress system, and autonomic dysfunction may be hallmarks of CFS. The relative contributions of each of these abnormalities to the profound fatigue associated with CFS need to be explored further to better evaluate and treat the syndrome.",

      "title": "How Anxiety Presents Differently in Older Adults: Age-Related Changes, Medical Comorbidities Alter Presentation and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Although anxiety disorders are common at all ages, there is a misconception that their prevalence drastically declines with age. For this reason anxiety disorders often are underdiagnosed and undertreated in geriatric patients, especially when the clinical presentation of these disorders in older patients differs from that seen in younger adults. In older persons, anxiety symptoms often overlap with medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism and geriatric patients tend to express anxiety symptoms as medical or somatic problems such as pain rather than as psychological distress. 1 As a result, older adults often seek treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms from their primary care physician instead of a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, primary care physicians often miss psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders, in geriatric patients. Anxiety may be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric disturbance, secondary to a general medical condition, or induced by dietary substances, substances of abuse, or medications. Late-life anxiety often is comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Box, page 66) and other psychological stressors as older adults recognize declining cognitive and physical functioning. (2) BOX Comorbid anxiety and depression: Highly prevalent, poorer outcomes The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam study--one of the largest epidemiologic studies to examine comorbidity of anxiety disorders and depression in patients age 55 to 85--found that 48% of older persons with primary major depressive disorder (MDD) also had a comorbid anxiety disorder, whereas approximately one-fourth of those with anxiety disorders also had MDD. (a) Pre-existing anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder, increase the risk of developing depression. Rates of comorbid anxiety and depression increase with age. (c) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Late-life MDD comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder is associated with greater memory decline than MDD alone. (d) In addition, comorbid anxiety and depression is associated with greater symptom severity and persistence, greater functional impairment, substance dependence, poorer compliance and response to treatment, worse overall prognosis and outcome than patients with either disorder alone, (e) and greater likelihood of suicidal ideation in older men. (f) Source: For reference citations, see this article at CurrentPsychiatry.com Anxiety disorders commonly begin in early adulthood, tend to be chronic and interspersed with remissions and relapses, and usually continue into old age. (3) In generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), there is a bimodal distribution of onset; approximately two-thirds of patients experience onset between the late teens and late 20s and one-third develop the disorder for the first time after age 50. (3) Prevalence rates for anxiety disorders among older adults (age >55) range from 3.5% to 10.2%.(4) These rates are slightly lower than those for younger adults. (5) Among older adults, presence of a 12-month anxiety disorder was associated with female sex, lower education, being unmarried, and having [grater than or equal to]3 or more chronic conditions. (6) Anxiety and disability risk Anxiety disorders affect geriatric patients more profoundly than their younger counterparts. Persons age >65 who have an anxiety disorder are 3 to 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than younger individuals. (1) Anxiety is associated with high rates of medically unexplained symptoms, increased use of health care resources, chronic medical illness, low levels of physical health-related quality of life, and physical disability.

      "title": "Whiplash headache: Does the diagnosis make more harm than the whiplash?",
      "abstract": "According to the study of Obermann et al. in the current issue of Cephalalgia, headache after whiplash injury is a self-limiting condition with a good prognosis. Although 4.6% fulfilled criteria for chronic whiplash headache, i.e. still having headache after 3 months, none had headache lasting more than 1 year. Predictors for headache lasting > 3 months were medication overuse, pre-existing pain conditions, and several psychological factors. Another factor, sore throat after the whiplash, was somewhat speculatively interpreted as a possible result of musculoskeletal damage. The headaches were mostly compatible with tension-type headache (TTH). Although the study has a positive message, that the headache subsides in less than a year, it also demonstrates some very problematic aspects of the whiplash headache entity. First, the criteria contain no description of the headache itself. It is sufficient that the headache and neck pain occur within 7 days after an event with a possible whiplash mechanism. For the chronic whiplash headache, it is required that the headache persists for > 3 months after the accident, but there is no requirement that the headache occurs with a certain frequency. This is in contrast to, for example, chronic TTH, where the headache must occur on more than half of the days for > 3 months. Quite wisely, therefore, the authors have in their definition of chronic headache added the requirement that the headache shall occur daily or near daily. Nevertheless, to find enough patients with ‘chronic’ headache for the analysis, they also used the criteria of the Quebec task force (QTF), but also these criteria have no definition of chronicity. An even more problematic aspect of the chronic whiplash headache entity is that, according to the very lax International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edn (ICHD-II) criteria, in principle any headache that occurs in an individual for years after the event can be classified as chronic whiplash headache, provided that there was head and neck pain during the first week. This is so even though this single event leaves no trace in the body that can be demonstrated by objective means, and even if the headache resembles the naturally occurring primary headaches, as demonstrated in this and previous studies (1,2). This issue is even more crucial after the demonstration that even sham whiplash accidents, involving virtually no physical forces but many psychological stressors, could induce head and neck pain in up to 20% of the exposed individuals within the first days after the event (3), hence allowing a diagnosis of whiplash headache according to the current ICHD-II criteria. Thus, it may be that so-called whiplash headache mostly or even exclusively represents primary headache induced by the stress of the situation (2). Theoretically, it is highly unsatisfactory to have a headache category named after each type of precipitant for headache episodes, psychological or other. From a practical viewpoint, it is probably unsound to name the headache after the whiplash event if the headache is a primary headache, particularly since most patients and health professionals will then tend to understand the aetiology in terms of a physical injury to head and neck structures. Many unhealthy practices (e.g. use of a neck collar, hazardous neck operations) that may increase the complaints stem from a traumatic conception of the headache, and the prognosis of headache after rear-end collisions seems to be best in cultures where the traumatic event is ignored (4). In the present study the incidence of chronic headache is consistent with the prevalence figures of chronic headache seen in population-based studies, and the authors wisely comment that development of chronicity in this whiplash group may have similar pathophysiological or clinical mechanisms to chronic headache in general. In my opinion, this raises the issue of whether whiplash headache is a biologically meaningful entity, i.e. caused by injury to head or neck structures. To solve this problem, descriptive case series based on patients presenting in an emergency room or to a",

Any external or internal discomfort that is caused by a physical, chemical, or emotional stressor may contribute to the complaint. Stress can also be defined as a state of being. Trauma, illnesses, poisons, injuries of any type, and infections of all kinds are examples of physical and chemical variables that can cause stress. There are many different types of emotional reasons of stress and strain. While numerous people associate the term stress with cerebral stress, scientists and croakers use this term to denote any force that impairs the stability and balance of fleshly functions.

In recent years,1 a diagnosis of insomnia has also included a report of decreased daytime function associated with the poor sleep at night to differentiate a patient with insomnia from an individual who simply requires less sleep. Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

      "title": "Psychosocial Treatments for Early Psychosis",
      "abstract": "People experiencing psychosis often have to deal with a number of problems. These problems may stem from certain symptoms. As explained in Chapter 2, these symptoms may include positive symptoms (such as hearing voices or having unusual beliefs), negative symptoms (such as being isolated, withdrawn, or slow), cognitive dysfunction (such as difficulties with attention, learning, or memory), and other types of symptoms. However, psychosocial difficulties (like problems with school, work, relationships, and recreation/leisure activities) may disrupt life as well, even though they are not necessarily thought of as symptoms. Unfortunately, these types of problems are very common for people dealing with a psychotic disorder. Treating the se difficulties in addition to the specific symptoms is necessary to begin to feel better and to live a full life. In fact, the recovery process focuses as much on resuming school, work, relationships, and leisure activities as it does on remission (see Chapter 11 on Promoting Recovery). Although medicines are extremely important in treating symptoms, especially positive symptoms (see Chapter 6 on Medicines Used to Treat Psychosis), another type of treatments, called psychosocial treatments, focus more on helping patients with these broader problems. Normal psychosocial development begins in childhood but continues throughout adolescence and early adulthood. Adolescence and early adulthood are extremely important times when most people develop social skills and build relationships. Late adolescence and early adulthood is typically a time of finishing high school, starting college, getting a first job, having a first romantic relationship, beginning to live more independently from parents, buying a car, and establishing career goals. Success in all of these domains of life requires both psychological skills and social skills. The term psychosocial brings together these two words. So, psychosocial development refers to the important developmental stage when psychological and social skills mature. Unfortunately, for people who develop a psychotic disorder, late adolescence and early adulthood is the period of time when a first episode of psychosis usually begins. Thus, psychosis that first happens in this time period often interrupts psychosocial development, leading to psychosocial problems. Psychosocial problems refer to difficulties at school, at work, in relationships, or in recreation and leisure activities.",

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Se trata de una observacion clinica durante un periodo de dos anos de un joven de 21 anos que se presentaba muchas veces en urgencias por una fuerte angustia con importantes trastornos del comportamiento caracterizados por agitaciones psicomotrices, automutilaciones repetidas, amenazas o intentos de homicidio hacia el padre, impulsos frecuentes y a veces conductas antisociales (fugas, estados de peligrosidad). En sus trastornos subyacian muchas veces ideas de persecucion y de referencia. Habia tambien frecuentes intentos de suicidio vinculados con breves periodos depresivos en los que verbalizaba un gran sufrimiento afectivo, que el explicaba esencialmente por dificultades relacionales familiares y por acontecimientos traumaticos (maltrato parental, accidentes). Dos anos despues, el cuadro clinico se agravo con la aparicion de sintomas esquizofrenicos constituidos por un delirio paranoide, alucinaciones con automatismo mental, retraccion social, desorganizacion afectiva y comportamental que se sustituyeron totalmente en sus pasos al acto autoagresivos. Luego se han vuelto mas complejos con la observacion psicoterapica que abre la problematica sexual e identitaria del paciente.La observacion consistio en una escucha atenta durante las entrevistas psicoterapicas regulares que han permitido recorrer la historia evolutiva de esta patologia, al mismo tiempo que su estabilizacion. Nuestro objetivo era despejar una perspectiva clinica y evolutiva que tomara en cuenta la progresion de los sintomas en funcion del tiempo hasta la constitucion de una psicosis propiamente dicha. Limitado por la exploracion neurobiologica (balances, EEG, IRM cerebral) sin resultado aparente, el analisis semiologico de los sintomas del paciente, de sus escritos y de sus simbolos nos ha permitido investigar diferentes fases precoces de la enfermedad, asi como el analisis psicopatologico de sus sintomas.Resultados: Esta experiencia personal nos ha permitido determinar el primer sintoma, conocer el periodo inicial de los trastornos y sus relaciones con los factores de vulnerabilidad (trauma parental y genetico), describir su evolucion segun la edad y reconstituir los sintomas de transicion psicotica. El fin de este articulo es subrayar el papel preventivo de la atencion precoz de los trastornos prepsicoticos. Sin embargo, sigue en pie el interrogante sobre el impacto de la angustia en el desarrollo neuropsiquico del paciente y sobre el origen genetico de la enfermedad. Conclusion: Insistimos en el enfoque preventivo que consiste en detectar los sujetos con riesgos de transicion psicotica y pensar en realizar una psicoterapia adaptada.",

      "abstract": "이 연구는 인류 최대의 성과로 인정되는 고령화가 전 세계적으로 급격히 진행되면서 발생하는 여러 가지 사회적, 심리적, 영적 과제들을 노인 우울증의 관점에서 논의한 논문이다. 노인들이 품위 있는 삶을 살아가려면 소득 보장과 건강의 문제에 우선순위를 두어야 한다. 그뿐 아니라 고령화가 불행이나 고통이 아닌 축복이 되게 하기 위해서는 품격과 정서적 안정감을 제공해야 한다. 특히 노년은 건강이나 배우자를 잃음으로, 경제적 능력을 상실함으로, 그 외에도 다양한 상실로 인해 우울증을 겪기 쉬운 시기이다. 우울한 노인들은 자신의 인생이 무가치하고 사랑받을 가치도 없다고 느낀다. 그러나 노인 우울증의 특징은 그런 증상들을 우울증이라 인지하기보다는 신체적 증상이라 여기며 호소하기 때문에 자칫 전문가라 하더라도 그런 증상을 놓치기 쉽다. 그러나 면밀하게 관찰하여 정확하게 진단할 수 있다면 노인 우울증은 치료될 수 있는 가능성이 높다. 거의 매일 우울한 기분, 슬픔, 무가치감, 죄책감, 구체적인 자살 계획 등이 동반된다면 치료자들은 반드시 우울증을 염두에 두어야 한다. 특히 가파르게 증가하는 독거노인들이 정서적 고갈로 고통을 겪지 않도록 교회는 눈을 이웃으로 돌려 돌봄과 섬김의 자원을 최대한 가동하기 시작해야 한다. 특히 정기적인 교회 출석과 돌보미들에 의한 대화는 독거노인들의 우울증을 감소시킨다. 과거에 대한 회상성이 증가하는 노인들의 이야기를 누군가가 친밀감을 가지고 경청해줄 때, 의미 있는 접촉을 통해 노인들은 우울증으로부터 회복될 수 있다. 교회는 무엇보다 죽음의 두려움을 이길 수 있는 영적 자원들을 활용함으로써 노인들의 정서적 회복 탄력성을 강화시키고, 기독교의 특권인 공동체의 활용과 사회적 지원을 통해 ‘사랑스런 공동체’를 세워가야 할 것이다.",

      "title": "The Importance of Early Diagnosis of Somatic Symptom Disorder: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "A somatic symptom disorder (SSD) diagnosis is made when a person places emphasis on physical symptoms such as pain, exhaustion, or shortness of breath so much that it causes significant suffering and/or functional issues. The individual's thoughts, sentiments, and activities are an overstated reaction to such symptoms. Regardless of whether the physical symptoms are connected to a diagnosable medical condition, the person experiences symptoms and believes they are ill. When a person exhibits symptoms that satisfy the diagnostic standards of an SSD, the disease should be identified. However, due to the disorder's frequent co-occurrence, particularly with anxiety and depressive disorders, support for these concurrent diagnoses should be sought. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based therapy, and medication are all examples of effective treatments for SSD. It has been demonstrated that tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) aid in treating symptoms. The authors describe the case of an eight-year-old boy with complaints of abdominal pain that were unexplained by various tests. The pain lasted 10 years and was episodic (each episode lasted around 10 days; one particular episode lasted approximately six months). Multiple investigations were conducted, but no physiological reason for his symptoms was discovered. His evaluation was conducted by an interdisciplinary team that included neurologists, psychiatrists, surgeons, and doctors. The underlying cause was subsequently determined to be SSD. As people with SSD present to general practitioners and the emergency room rather than psychiatric facilities, this incident serves as a sobering reminder of the need to advocate for an accurate diagnosis of this condition.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with disorganization progressive and important affecting several spheres: thought, affectivity, cognition and social life of the subject. It is a serious mental disorder with a prevalence of nearly 1%. Men would present more premorbid difficulties, but the overall prevalence of symptoms of schizophrenia is similar in both sexes. When it comes to comorbidity, men and women are vulnerable to somewhat different health issues. Anxiety symptoms are one of the main symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, but the effect of anxiety symptoms on patients is easily overlooked. About 40% have persistent anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, and whether they are accompanied depressive symptoms, the symptoms may have a greater impact on the patients. We need to help patients avoid suicide when the symptoms depression appear. Hallucinations auditory, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms may exist simultaneously in patients with schizophrenia. Most studies focus on studying the relationship between auditory hallucinatory symptoms and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, the relationship between auditory hallucinatory symptoms and anxiety symptoms, or the relationship between anxiety symptoms and symptoms depressive Objectives The objective of this study is to resolve important questions concerning the interaction of anxiety and schizophrenia in patients followed in psychiatry at Arrazi Hospital . Methods Descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study, conducted over a period from May 2022 to October 2022 in patients consulted in Arrazi de Salé, using a questionnaire grouping together the sociodemographic characteristics, the risks and the advantages of antipsychotics, medical comorbidities and the mobilization of psychosocial support, and thus the BPRS Anxiety Rating Scale. Results Of the 42 patients who completed the study, 18 were female and 24 were male 60% were single. The average age was 36.63 years, 60% have secondary education, 25% primary, and 15% university level, 30% have a family history of schizophrenia. 32 were taking an atypical antipsychotic, 10 were taking classic neuroleptics. Most schizophrenics encountered in psychiatry are stabilized on antipsychotic treatment, and those who have an anxious comorbidity are still too often underestimated , put on the account of the positive symptoms and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, it is insufficiently diagnosed and treated. The effect of anxiety symptoms on patients is easily overlooked. It should be kept in mind that anxiety in schizophrenia requires special attention when discussing and prescribing antipsychotic medications. Conclusions Optimal interventions for patients with comorbid schizophrenia and anxiety differ by quality of life. At all consultations, preventive strategies should consider mindful interviews and the risks and benefits of treatment for schizophrenia and comorbidities. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Common psychiatric problems in cancer patients include depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and delirium. Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

Community studies indicate that 19% of men and 31% of women will develop some type of anxiety disorder during their lifetime. In one such study, the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), risk factors associated with a lifetime of anxiety disorder included lower income, less education, living in the northeast, and being female. The impact of patient sex is profound in that it increases the likelihood of developing an anxiety disorder by 85% in women compared to men. Panic disorder is characterized by brief but intense recurrent episodes of fear or discomfort. Diagnostic criteria require recurrent panic attacks in 1 month or one panic attack with continuous fear of other attacks. Symptoms associated with the panic attack include palpitations; sweating; feeling short of breath or a choking sensation; nausea or abdominal discomfort; feeling dizzy; having a sense of unreality; numbness or tingling; chills or hot flushes; and a fear of dying or losing control.",

      "abstract": "【With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.】",

      "abstract": "A group of insomniacs whose only sleep-stage abnormality was prolonged sleep latency was identified. Prior to sleep onset, these subjects had significantly higher levels of physiological activity than did normal sleepers. With the approach of sleep onset, these differences diminished. No group differences in presleep cognitive activity were found. Insomniacs had significantly higher Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) scores than normal on scales indicating neuroticism, anxiety, and worry (derived from the Hysteria, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales). Although sleep-onset insomnia is accompanied by psychological disturbance and heightened physiological activity, it is unlikely that either factor alone is sufficient to cause it. Excessive rumination may be an epiphenomenon of sleeplessness. Chronic insomnia is a distressing complaint that affects millions of persons (Solomon, 1979). Three general types of insomnia have been described: initial, or sleep-onset; intermittent, or sleep-maintenance; and terminal, or early morning awakening (Kleitman, 1963). The present investigation is concerned with primary idiopathic sleep-onset insomnia: the inability to fall asleep in the absence of identifiable physiological or psychological determinants. Many theories have been advanced to explain idiopathic insomnia (Rechtschaffen & Monroe, 1969). Two of the most popular suggest that insomniacs are either physiologically or cognitively hyperaroused relative to normal (Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, 1979; Borkovec, 1979). Support for the first hypothesis has rested largely on a study by Monroe (1967), demonstrating that self-defined poor sleepers had higher levels of physiological activity than good",

With all facts on hand, the patient’s notable history of psychiatric disorders, namely depression, anxiety and social isolation, as well as signs of extreme fatigue and syncope may well have been caused by a gradual onset of primary adrenal insufficiency. Long delays in diagnosis are not uncommon, as in this case where the actual condition was identified just in time when the patient presented with a life-threatening cardiovascular collapse.",

      "title": "Psychosocial and socioeconomic burden of vasomotor symptoms in menopause: A comprehensive review",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many women experience vasomotor symptoms at or around the time of menopause. Hot flushes and night sweats are considered primary menopausal symptoms that may also be associated with sleep and mood disturbances, as well as decreased cognitive function. All of these symptoms may lead to social impairment and work-related difficulties that significantly decrease overall quality of life. Hot flushes have shown a great deal of variability in their frequency and severity in women. In some women, hot flushes persist for several months; in others, they may last for more than 10 years. Traditionally vasomotor symptoms were reported to begin 5 to 10 years prior to the cessation of the final menstrual cycle, corresponding with the initial decline in circulating gonadal hormones; however, night sweats in particular most often begin in perimenopause. The pathogenesis of hot flushes has not yet been fully elucidated, but the circuitry involving estrogen and neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and serotonin specifically, are hypothesized to play a major role in the altered homeostatic thermoregulatory mechanisms underlying these events. Menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms are associated with significant direct and indirect costs. Overall costs of traditional pharmacotherapy or complementary and alternative medicine modalities, including over-the-counter treatments and dietary supplements, for managing menopause-related vasomotor symptoms are substantial and include initial and follow-up physician visits and telephone calls. Additional costs include laboratory testing, management of adverse events, loss of productivity at work, and personal and miscellaneous costs. Pharmacoeconomic analyses, including those that consider risks identified by the Women's Health Initiative, generally support the cost-effectiveness of hormonal therapy for menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms, which have been the mainstay for the management of these symptoms for more than 50 years. However, because many women now want to avoid hormone therapy, there is a need for additional targeted therapies, validated by results from controlled clinical trials that are safe, efficacious, cost-effective, and well tolerated by symptomatic menopausal women.",

Two physiological systems, the sympathetic adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, respond to stress; collectively these systems serve to increase mental alertness and provide energy to allow an organism to respond rapidly to an emergent situation. While the response is adaptive for short‐term and infrequent stressors, modern human life presents more persistent stressors which can have a negative impact on health. Psychosocial stress has a variety of emotional, behavioral, and physiological consequences. Biological anthropologists have demonstrated that environmental changes, cultural transitions, and every day stressors result in elevated stress markers and negative health consequences across the lifespan.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is characterized by chronic subjective dizziness, phobic postural vertigo, and related disorders. For at least 3 months, it exhibits varying symptoms of vertigo, unsteadiness, or dizziness. Methods: Research articles regarding PPPD were searched by viewing the Scopus, PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases online. A search strategy using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis was used. Results: It presents a typical chronic vestibular system and brain malfunction that result in persistent dizziness, nonspinning vertigo, and/or unsteadiness. Persistent nonvertiginous dizziness and hypersensitivity to motion and visual stimuli are the main signs and symptoms of PPPD. These symptoms appeared either when there were no active neuro-otologic illnesses or when an episodic vestibular condition was present but could not completely account for the symptoms. Psychological mechanisms that resemble cognitive models of health anxiety and panic disorder are involved in the PPPDs development and maintenance. Conclusion: Since PPPDs diagnostic criteria only involve symptoms, the patient's clinical history is crucial in making the diagnosis. Once diagnosed, effective communication and personalized treatment plans, such as serotonergic medicines, cognitive behavioral therapy, and specialized physical therapy (vestibular rehabilitation), help manage PPPD. Since PPPD is a relatively recent clinical diagnosis, many medical practitioners who treat patients who feel dizzy are unfamiliar with it.",

Some of these individuals are overtly psychotic: deluded and hallucinated, or uncontrollably depressed, or assailed by intolerable anxiety, guilt, or hostile feelings. More are acutely neurotic, and their acts may be seen as manipulative gestures, or cries for help, or acting-out maneuvers. A large portion have disordered personalities and faulty character structures, often with alcoholism, narcotic addiction, sexual psychopathy, passive-aggressive disturbance, or emotional immaturity, instability, or inadequacy. Frequent accompaniments are adolescent turmoil, marital discord, school or work problems, chronic or terminal illness, or geriatric disease. Thus the physician has usually been consulted before",

      "title": "The critical role of psychosomatics in promoting a new perspective upon health and disease.",
      "abstract": "In an evolutionary model, health and disease are regarded as successful and respectively failed adaptation to the demands of the environment. The social factors are critical for a successful adaptation, while emotions are means of both signaling the organism's state and of adapting the physiological responses to environmental challenges. Hence the importance of a biopsychosocial model of health and disease. Psychoemotional distress generates and/or amplifies somatic symptoms. Somatization may be viewed as an altered cognitive process, inclining the individual to an augmented perception of bodily sensations and to an increased degree of complexity in reporting negative experiences (hence the greater cognitive effort allocated thereto). Somatosensory amplification and alexithymia are key elements in this process. The brain's right hemisphere is more involved in the generation of emotionally conditioned somatization symptoms. Somatic symptoms have various psychological and social functions and are strongly influenced by the particular belief system of the individual. Inappropriately perceiving the environment as an aggressor and excessively responding to it (by activating the cytokine system in correlation with the arousal of the psychic, nervous, and endocrine systems) may be a key element in the altered cognition conducive to ill health.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer..

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar]. Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness. Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation. The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicide Differential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made. Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar]. Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting. Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar]. Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability. an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]. Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death. adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well. The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral). General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agents Psychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T.

Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D.

      "abstract": "This article presents an overview of stress and its impacts on the neuroendocrine system as well as on animal well-being. Anything that poses a challenge or threat to well-being is stress. It is a state of threathened homeostasis. An agent or stimulus that causes stress is a stressor. A stressor is a powerful activator of the neuroendocrine system, provided it is of sufficient intensity and/or duration. The neuroendocrine system is one of the most responsive physiological systems to stressors. This responsiveness occur since the neuroendocrine system is a key signaler and modulator of many of the other physiological systems attempting to accommodate stressors and re-establish homeostasis. A persistent threat to homeostasis may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system which impairs rather than contribute to well-being. Long-term stress results in adrenal fatigue, neurotransmitter imbalances or deficiencies and hormone imbalance. When the endocrine system is not functioning properly, an animal can not cope with stress effectively. This results in a vicious cycle where the weakened endocrine system creates more stress and the higher levels of stress continuously weaken the endocrine system the more. The solution is to reduce as much as possible and find ways of coping and managing the stress that cannot be removed.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common mental disorder that presents with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep and/or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration.Depression is a widespread and often chronic condition.Lifetime prevalence estimates for major depressive disorder are approximately 15% to 20%; 1-year prevalence estimates are 5% to 10%.Moreover, depression is characterized by high rates of relapse: 22% to 50% of patients suffer recurrent episodes within 6 months after recovery.Depression is associated with a high incidence of co-morbid somatic illness.Individuals suffering from major depression run a higher relative risk of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis compared with the general population.In general, depressed individuals exhibit a less active life-style and have a reduced cardio-respiratory fitness in comparison with the general population.Strong evidence demonstrates that lack of physical activity is associated with an unhealthier body mass and composition, and a biomarker risk profile for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and osteoporosis.A growing body of evidence suggests that exercise is an effective treatment for depression.For mild to moderate depression the effect of exercise may be comparable to antidepressant medication and psychotherapy; for severe depression exercise seems to be a valuable complementary therapy to the traditional treatments.Exercise training not only improves depression, but also produces 'positive side effects' on depression associated physical diseases and cognitive decline.",

      "abstract": "Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a disruptive behavior disorder characterized by a pattern of angry or irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting for at least six months. Children and adolescents with ODD may have trouble controlling their temper and are often disobedient and defiant toward others. There are no tools specifically designed for diagnosing ODD, but multiple questionnaires can aid in diagnosis while assessing for other psychiatric conditions. ODD is often comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and mood disorders, including anxiety and depression. Behavioral therapy for the child and family members improves symptoms of ODD. Medications are not recommended as first-line treatment for ODD; however, treatment of comorbid mental health conditions with medications often improves ODD symptoms. Adults and adolescents with a history of ODD have a greater than 90% chance of being diagnosed with another mental illness in their lifetime. They are at high risk of developing social and emotional problems as adults, including suicide and substance use disorders. Early intervention seeks to prevent the development of conduct disorder, substance abuse, and delinquency that can cause lifelong social, occupational, and academic impairments.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is a deeply unpleasant emotion with a feeling of impending danger but no identifiable threat. It can be a personality tendency, an emotional state, or a syndrome; clinical anxiety occurs when the feeling becomes more severe, persistent or pervasive than normal. Work factors are important in producing anxiety especially when they interact with home, marital or leisure problems. Anxiety can be assessed by interview, formal rating scales, measurement of physiological and endocrine variables such as heart rate and adrenaline excretion. Anxiety is the commonest of milder psychiatric conditions and may present in many ways which the clinician should aim to detect.",

Appropriate medical therapy is essential for acute illness and for relatively short chronic illness, but the beneficial influence of religious activity should not be overlooked.

      "abstract": "The clinical approach to evaluation and management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) involves taking an accurate history, prospective daily symptom monitoring to establish the diagnosis, patient-specific initial medical or psychological therapy, and adequate follow-up with appropriate alterations in the treatment plan. A typical patient can present with premenstrual irritability, mood swings, anxiety and/or depression, and physical symptoms that may include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, appetite, and sleep alterations, or difficulty concentrating; these conditions result in significant overall interference with daily activities or social interactions. As the symptoms are not unique in their nature but only in their timing, the diagnosis should be made only after the patient completes daily recording of bothersome symptoms for 2-3 consecutive months. However, a detailed psychiatric interview by an appropriately trained professional may rule out underlying affective disorder. This may be a useful compromise when only retrospective information is available.1 Various medical and affective disorders included in the differential diagnosis must be excluded. Current management strategies include education and self-care, calcium supplementation, and the choice of a number of psychotropic agents that augment serotonin, administered either throughout the cycle or during the luteal phase alone. Pharmacological options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), serotonergic tricyclic antidepressants, or hormonal approaches that prevent ovulation, such as some oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists), danazol, and highdose estrogen. Psychological approaches, including cognitive/behavioral and relaxation therapy, may alsobe effective. The treatment plan should be designed according to the patient's specific symptoms, past pharmacological treatment experiences, and other current and past health and contraceptive needs.",

      "title": "Cancer-Related Fatigue: Nursing Assessment and Management",
      "abstract": "Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), the most common side effect of cancer and cancer treatment, is unlike the acute fatigue we experience from working all day in our jobs and with our families. It is an unpredictable, intense, overwhelming sense of tiredness or energy depletion. Fatigue is also defined as exhaustion, lethargy, lack of concentration and motivation, weakness, and depression. 1 It can occur suddenly and may not end when treatment ends but last months or even years. Patients with advanced colo-rectal cancer, lung and breast cancers, and lymphoma, all of which are managed under a variety of treatment regimens, report fatigue. 2 The onset, duration, and intensity of CRF have variable patterns, most notably in people receiving chemotherapy. Many report fatigue during the first few days after treatment, with a peak in fatigue when blood counts reach their lowest (nadir) and a decrease in fatigue before the next chemotherapy cycle. 1,3 Several studies have examined patterns of fatigue from radiation. 3–5 Findings suggest that fatigue may be cumulative over four to six weeks of treatment, with an increase in the presence of other physical symptoms, mood disturbances, and changes in usual activity. 3 For people receiving biologic therapies, fatigue is cumulative and related to dose and schedule. 6,7 With more types of cancer being treated with a combination of these therapies, the number of people affected by CRF is rising. People receiving cancer treatment can best describe CRF’s effect on their quality of life and thereby provide insight into its definition. A 76-year-old woman with lung cancer stated, “The morning after my treatment I could not get out of bed. When I finally did, I could only walk as far as the bathroom, then back to bed. I did not dare walk into the kitchen to prepare breakfast. My legs felt like lead.” A 52-year-old man with colon cancer described his fatigue. “I tried to work while taking my treatments, but I was exhausted by noon. I decided to work at home with my computer, but found it hard to focus. I tried to nap, but I never felt rested.” On the initiation of her second chemotherapy regimen, a 37-year-old woman with breast cancer recalled, “The first round of treatment made me so tired. My body ached. For the last three treatments, I found myself in bed most of the time. I could not be a wife or a mother to three small children.” A variety of patterns and multiple factors influence an individual’s experience of CRF. 1,8 With the interactions of multiple physiologic and psychological factors, CRF remains difficult to describe, and subsequently, manage. 9 Cancer-related fatigue has long been a misunderstood side effect of cancer treatment, and unfortunately the message often conveyed to patients and their families is that it’s unavoidable and needs to be tolerated. ASSESSING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE The etiology of CRF cannot always be determined. 10 Several contributing factors have been identified: cancer and cancer treatments, anemia, neutropenia, sleep disturbance, depression, nutritional disturbance, and coping with other side effects of cancer treatment such as pain and nausea. 8 Along with complaints of unusual tiredness or weakness, people with CRF have decreased physical stamina, withdrawal from social activities, and decreased motivation. They may express irritability or impatience. 2 CRF’s cognitive manifestation ranges from sluggish thought process to inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, decreased short-term memory, and shortened attention span, 11 which may interfere with the person’s ability to fully participate in work, family, and social activities. Given that the contributing factors of CRF may be multicausal, and those interrelationships are the subject of many research questions, the current approach to assessment and nursing intervention needs to be multifaceted. Fatigue may present a challenge for nursing assessment because of the inherent difficulty in measuring a subjective symptom. Here are some guidelines to consider in assessing fatigue: Assess CRF as one would pain.1 First, allow patients to describe their fatigue in their own words by using open-ended questions such as, “Tell me about your fatigue.” Afterward, it’s useful to refer to the symptom by using the patient’s own words which hold significant meaning. More specific responses may be prompted by questions related to the patient’s functional mobility and ability to participate in leisure activities. Use a scale. A 0-to-5 or 0-to-10 response scale helps determine the patient’s perception of the severity of his fatigue. Select a scale that’s familiar to other care providers in the clinical setting, and use the same scale for other subjective symptoms such as pain or nausea. Having a consistent rating system helps everyone interpret a patient’s symptom patterns more quickly. Determine aggravating and alleviating factors. Ask the patient what makes his fatigue seem more severe, and what has worked and not worked in the past to prevent or reduce fatigue. Document assessment findings. This is critical for communication among health care providers. One initial assessment strategy is to track hemoglobin counts and fatigue scores on a graph (vital signs or treatment flowsheet) so that the nurse can convey to the physician how the patient is experiencing fatigue in reference to other symptoms, treatments, and lab values. The information also may be useful for individualizing fatigue management. SUGGEST AN ACTIVE APPROACH People experiencing CRF may make adjustments in their lives long before they seek guidance from health care providers. The usual fatigue self-management strategies, such as sleep and rest, which are more appropriate for healthy persons managing acute fatigue, are passive approaches. 9 In managing CRF, strategies need to be targeted toward maintaining sufficient energy to participate in the most meaningful life activities as defined by the person experiencing fatigue. 12 Because of the multicausal and multidimensional nature of CRF, 7 more than one management strategy may be necessary to provide relief. From a review of theoretical and research literature on CRF, Emma Ream and Alison Richardson identified three core activities to reduce the effect of fatigue: effective management of associated symptoms, enhancement of activity balanced with rest, and management of emotional stress. 9 Although more investigation is necessary to identify and test successful strategies for minimizing fatigue, several approaches for managing CRF have been supported by nursing research: preparatory education, physical activity, psychosocial support resources, and attention-restoring activities. Following are self-management strategies that can be incorporated into nursing practice: Acknowledgment of fatigue. Acknowledgment of the existence of CRF is a crucial first step toward assessment and management. Its recognition by the health care provider identifies CRF to be as important as nausea and vomiting, pain, peripheral neuropathy, or other treatment-related symptoms that affect quality of life. People with cancer report that having a health care provider simply inquire about their fatigue is meaningful because it indicates that their fatigue is worthy of intervention. 13 Preparatory information. By providing patients with information on fatigue, what’s known about it, and how it can be managed, the nurse validates not only its presence, but expresses her interest in working with the patient to manage it. A study of people receiving radiation therapy reported that those who prepare themselves for impending fatigue experience it less than those who receive no preparatory information. 14 With realistic expectations, people experiencing CRF can adjust and adapt to this symptom. 2 Prioritizing and pacing activities. Discuss with your patient how to prioritize and pace activities, including rest. 15 In setting priorities, it’s important to include a family member so that the choices for rest and activity reflect the needs of patient and family. As a man receiving chemotherapy explained, “I try to work three days a week—Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I need one day off to recuperate from eight hours of work. My wife thinks I’m lazy because I have no energy to do what she wants me to do.” Encourage the person with CRF to review his usual weekly activities and identify low, moderate, or high priorities. Eliminate the low-priority activities and negotiate the moderate-priority activities into a daily schedule. Suggest assigning low-or moderate-priorities activities that are essential to other family members. If prioritizing and planning activities are energy depleting for the patient, assign a job broker, a family member or friend who can organize and assign tasks such as grocery shopping and meal preparation. There are certain tasks that may be obligatory to the patient’s role in the family. For example, a mother of three school-age children was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. She felt it was her role to complete her usual to-do list of household chores, although she knew it took much of her energy. Her nurse helped her identify realistic expectations and develop new strategies. For this family, the task of doing laundry was divided into smaller activities for each family member. Her husband brought the hamper into the living room where his wife could sort the dirty laundry. She taught the older children to use the washer and dryer in the basement. The children brought the clothes upstairs for their mother to fold and put away. By breaking down household chores, the patient was able to participate and maintain her role in the family. Balancing activity and rest. In addition to prioritizing activities, a balanced schedule of activity and rest is important. 15 One woman in a cancer support group referred to her experience with fatigue as “living with the toddler effect.” She described pushing herself like a toddler who moves from one activity to another before finally collapsing. She stated, “I didn’t know another way to manage my fatigue.” Often, the balance between activity and rest is difficult. For some people, rest means sleeping for an extended time. Whereas lying down and shutting one’s eyes may be appropriate for a short time, sleeping on and off throughout the day interrupts sleep cycles at night and creates more symptom distress. To alleviate CRF, rest is more effective when used as a respite from activity. Short, frequent periods of inactivity, such as sitting quietly or lying down, strategically planned throughout the day, are more beneficial than long periods of sleep. 15 Physical activity. The nurse may need to help a person with CRF develop an incremental plan to increase physical activity. Even normally physically active people can and do exercise during treatment. However, the intensity and duration of the activity may need to be modified. 16 Although regular physical activity is an important component of a healthy lifestyle, Anna Schwartz confirmed that many health care providers do not provide information about it or encourage people with cancer to exercise. 16 Several studies of women receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy for breast cancer and who participated in moderately intense aerobic exercises or a walking program reported that participants had less fatigue and emotional distress than those in usual care groups. 17–19 Patients report that physical activity is most effective when symptoms like fatigue are at their worst. 20 Of all the physical activities studied that have been used by people experiencing fatigue (walking, riding a stationary bicycle, low-impact aerobics, and swimming), walking is the most convenient, low cost, and low risk, regardless of age. In addition, walking may provide distraction, socialization, and attention-restoration. One young man, after his third cycle of treatment for lymphoma, had been hospitalized for an extended period of time. Upon returning home, he needed an incremental plan for increasing his physical activity. The first few days he focused on getting out of bed, getting dressed, and moving about his house. The plan also included activities beginning with sitting on the front porch and progressing toward walking down the driveway, to the end of the street, around the block, and continuing until he was able to choose his own physical activities. When he returned to the clinic, he shared with the staff a rediscovery of what he enjoyed most in life: socializing with friends, hiking, biking, and running. More study is necessary to determine specific recommendations for the appropriate type and amount of exercise. Overall, physical activity needs to be initiated at a comfortable level. Gradually, the intensity and duration may be increased to three to four days per week. 20 Energy conservation. Encourage the person experiencing fatigue to perform tasks that expend the least amount of energy. A collaborative approach among physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses, and physicians supports the integration of energy-conserving strategies into planning daily activities and adapting the home environment. Eileen Donovan described several energy-conserving strategies for self-care, meal preparation, housekeeping, shopping, child care, and work. 21 Simple strategies, such as sitting rather than standing, or moving items closer within reach, decrease the amount of energy used. A breast cancer survivor, who had experienced fatigue, described her energy-conservation strategy for grocery shopping to her support group. She prepared the grocery list the day before and organized it by aisle. She planned her trip to a familiar neighborhood market at a time when it was less congested. She supported herself with a grocery cart as she moved from aisle to aisle, and took a 15-minute break halfway through on a bench in front of the store. After she paid the bill, she always asked for assistance with carrying the groceries to her car. Psychosocial support resources. People receiving radiation treatment and chemotherapy find it affects many aspects of their lives: their ability to work, their physical and emotional well-being, their ability to enjoy life in the moment, and their intimacy with their partner. 22 People with a history of chemotherapy indicated that CRF made it more difficult to participate in social activities, and to maintain relationships with family and friends. 23 A nurse referral to psychosocial resources, such as support groups, can help the patient cope with the effect of fatigue on quality of life. Through support groups, patients learn new self-management strategies that they can share with others. The selection of a specific psychosocial resource needs to be individualized. 9 Some people with CRF may be open to support group activities and benefit from a group, while others may prefer one-to-one counseling. Attention-restoring activities. People with CRF are often overwhelmed by an overstimulating environment. Their attention is diverted by the many sights, sounds, and objects in the health care environment—alarms, the fast-paced movement of staff, and painful procedures. Consequently, the patient, overburdened by information and environmental distractions, may not understand what’s being said. Bernadine Cimprich pioneered research in attentional fatigue, 1 the decreased capacity to concentrate or direct attention. 24 Natural environments or scenes such as a waterfall, a garden, or a sunrise may restore the patient’s ability to concentrate and comprehend. Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, who participated in individualized, attention-restoring activities for 30 minutes three times a week, experienced significant improvements in attentional capacity compared to a control group. 11 Following participation in attention-restoring strategies, the person with fatigue may think more clearly and participate more actively in personal care and activities. The implications of Cimprich’s research are significant for providing information and education to people with fatigue and designing more supportive environments for them. Nurses are increasingly aware that the number of people experiencing CRF is rising. Cancer-related fatigue permeates every aspect of daily life: work, family, and social activities. Although more research is required to determine the effectiveness of proposed strategies to prevent and alleviate fatigue, the profound physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual effect of fatigue demands that nurses intervene now. Nurses can be instrumental in identifying, evaluating, and aiding patients with fatigue to make the transition from passive to more active self-care strategies. Fortunately, more than a trial-and-error approach exists for fatigue management in current clinical practice. CRF theories direct nurses to management strategies such as providing preparatory information, assisting the patient to establish a balance of activity and rest, encouraging use of psychosocial support resources, and recommending attention-restoring activities. Managing CRF effectively requires nurses to thoughtfully and thoroughly pursue strategies that prevent physical deconditioning and allow people with fatigue to continue engaging in meaningful activities.",

      "title": "SINTOMAS DEPRESSIVOS EM ACADÊMICOS DE UMA UNIVERSIDADE PÚBLICA NO OESTE DO ESTADO DO PARÁ, RELATO DE EXPERIÊNCIA",
      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A depressao e um disturbio do afeto e/ou do humor, que e caracterizado por sintomas como, piora do sono, do apetite, da auto-estima, pela tristeza, sentimento de culpa, entre outros. O individuo depressivo tem dificuldade em descrever experiencias emocionais positivas, sendo pouco aberto a sentimentos otimistas. Alem disso, na depressao nao existe apenas queixa de tristeza, mas tambem ha mudancas de humor que culminam em crises frequentes de explosao de raiva, que levam ao desgaste da saude fisica e emocional, prejuizos no convivio social, na aprendizagem e ideias e/ou tentativas frequentes de suicidio. Esse transtorno e considerado uma pandemia e a terceira maior causa a nivel global de doencas. Sao inumeros os fatores que podem contribuir para o desenvolvimento da depressao, como por exemplo, o baixo suporte social, a presenca de eventos estressantes, pensamentos negativos, problemas financeiros, entre outros. Alguns dados encontrados nos universitarios nesta pesquisa, sao considerados elevados, no que tange ao processo depressivo, e ganham maior destaque ainda quando comparados com a populacao em geral. Isso e possivel, pois e nessa fase academica que se exige muito esforco do adolescente ou jovem adulto, onde o mesmo deve aprender a lidar com uma gama de responsabilidades que estarao presentes em sua vida futura, tanto como academico, quanto como profissional. Estes incluem a adaptacao de cumprimento de prazos e horarios, a distância dos pais e demais familiares, a falta de motivacao para os estudos, dentre outros conflitos internos e/ou externos. Diante dessas informacoes, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em relatar a presenca de sinais e sintomas depressivos encontrados em academicos de uma instituicao de ensino superior em Santarem- PA, atraves de uma escuta qualificada. Desenvolvimento : Este estudo trata-se de um relato de experiencia acerca das vivencias durante uma acao em saude que ocorreu no dia 24 de abril de 2017 desenvolvida por academicos de enfermagem da Universidade do Estado do Para (UEPA) Campus XII-Santarem, a acao foi baseada na metodologia ativa da problematizacao segundo o Projeto Politico Pedagogico (PPP) do curso de enfermagem da UEPA para a Atividade Integrada em Saude que e um momento em que o academico de enfermagem integra todos os eixos da grade curricular do semestre, escolhendo assim um tema a ser abordado, assim como o publico, que foi composto de academicos dos cursos contemplados na universidade: enfermagem, musica, educacao fisica, medicina e fisioterapia. A tematica foi abordada atraves de acao educativa em saude, organizada pelos academicos do curso de enfermagem com diversos topicos como: alimentacao, avaliacao de risco para o desenvolvimento de doencas cronicas, avaliacao de medidas antropometricas e, nesta atividade, avaliacao da saude mental com a investigacao da existencia de sintomas depressivos. Durante a acao os academicos de enfermagem, em um primeiro momento, distribuiram folders contendo informacoes sobre a depressao e, posteriormente conversaram individualmente com cada academico que, de forma voluntaria, concordaram discutir sobre sintomas que, de acordo com o CID-10, poderiam estar sentindo. Durante a conversa os sintomas investigados foram: fadiga aumentada ou perda de energia fisica e mental, perda de interesse e prazer, classificados como sintomas fundamentais; apetite diminuido, atividade diminuida, auto-estima e autoconfianca diminuida, concentracao e atencao diminuida, sentimento de culpa e inutilidade, pensamentos e/ou atos lesivos ou suicidas, sono perturbado, visao pessimista do futuro, classificados como sintomas episodicos. Alem disso, a acao contou com a ajuda de um psicologo que atendeu os participantes que apresentaram sintomas graves da depressao. Os participantes que apresentaram maior necessidade foram orientados a buscar tratamento efetivo com intervencao de psicologo. Resultados : A maioria dos entrevistados mostraram-se bastante interessados no assunto e nao demonstravam muita timidez, apresentaram-se bem a vontade e com disposicao para dialogar, o que de certa forma surpreendeu a equipe, que esperava uma resistencia por parte dos academicos, com isso observou-se facilitacao do trabalho para a equipe dos entrevistadores. Apos a entrevista, os academicos de enfermagem, organizadores da acao, detectaram uma alta incidencia de sintomas fundamentais e episodicos em um numero significativos dos universitarios, o que pode ser considerado uma situacao preocupante. No decorrer da acao, muitos academicos participantes, relataram o quanto consideravam acoes desse genero, importantes na universidade, por sentirem-se sobrecarregados pelas atividades academicas, desorientados, desanimados e com pensamentos pessimistas. Podem ser classificados como poucas as acoes voltadas para os academicos, sobretudo, os academicos da area da saude, ja que eles sao os principais responsaveis por promoverem esse tipo de acoes e que acabam deixando de se cuidar, nao lembrando-se que tambem precisam de cuidado e atencao. Deste modo, e inegavel a grande satisfacao de poder contribuir de alguma forma para esta comunidade e acredita-se que, todos os academicos tiveram uma boa oportunidade de serem ouvidos de forma mais qualificada por um profissional apto a lhe dar orientacoes essenciais que visem a prevencao diagnostica, alem de recuperacao e promocao da saude mental. Consideracoes Finais : Apos a acao em saude, alguns academicos que se ausentaram no dia em que a acao ocorreu procuraram a equipe afim de, saberem se haveria outra acao semelhante, alegando que gostariam de serem ouvidos ou ate mesmo referindo interesse de um amigo (a) na consulta psicologica. Essa experiencia aponta para a necessidade de que academicos na area da saude devem cuidar da saude mental de forma frequente sem negligenciar as tensoes e o estresse advindos da propria universidade, antes de serem lancados no mercado de trabalho. Alem da necessidade de acompanhamento psicologico para os academicos nas proprias universidades, sejam elas publicas ou privadas, no decorrer da formacao afim de manter a saude mental e de prevenir, diagnosticar ou ainda tratar quadros depressivos e outras doencas mentais que podem comprometer seu rendimento academico e a sua saude geral, visando reduzir dados crescentes relacionados a sintomatologia da depressao em universitarios. Essa experiencia mostrou que mesmo em cursos da area da saude, a saude mental ainda e pouco debatida, precisando assim, de uma atencao tanto dos academicos com sua propria saude, como da instituicao de ensino, promovendo um espaco e profissionais capacitados que possam auxiliar enquanto o academico estiver em formacao.",

Travelling is a stressing factor that may trigger or aggravate mood disorders, anxiety disorders or substance related problems. Expatriates are especially at elevated risk for adaptation problems due to the length of their stays abroad. Some destinations with strong symbolic or mystical connotations are associated with acute psychotic episodes. Anticipating changes and being prepared to face new solicitations to come allows to reduce risks for mental health while travelling.",

By reviewing various epidemiological studies, relationships among some chronic diseases and depression have been noted. The depression-disease order of appearance can de bi-directional. It seems that stress, depression and inflammation have the capacity to affect the balance of cykotines produced by the immunological system. Modulation of the immunological system by the central nervous system is controIled/mediada by a complex bi-directional network composed of signals among the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immunological system. The most frequent diseases related to depression are chronic but some are acute: of the central nervous system, endocrines, infections. Chronic pain also seems related to this problem. Pain, fatigue or tiredness are considered symptoms of a hidden depression and others, physical as well as psychiatric, could be algias, parestesias, headaches, vertigo, or gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory neurodegenerative disorders.",

Las vias del dolor transmiten la informacion nociceptiva a traves del sistema nervioso periferico y central y estan plenamente integradas con el sistema motor y simpatico a nivel medular y de los centros nerviosos superiores y dan lugar a actividad motora refleja, hiperactividad simpatica y respuestas afectivas y conductuales. Objetivo : Definir los mecanismos fisiopatologicos que se desencadenan en presencia de dolor agudo y las alteraciones que consecuentemente generan en diferentes organos y sistemas. Desarrollo : Las respuestas generadas a nivel segmentario, suprasegmentario y cortical dan lugar a alteraciones fisiopatologicas en el sistema cardiovascular, respiratorio y en otros organos y sistemas. Estas alteraciones pueden modificar negativamente el curso de la lesion o enfermedad que origino el dolor y provocar graves trastornos hemodinamicos que pueden llevar a la muerte del paciente. Conclusiones : Aunque el dolor agudo tiene una funcion biologica protectora, cuando es persistente o no mitigado provoca alteraciones fisiopatologicas en los diferentes organos y sistemas que son nocivas para el paciente. Pese al rapido progreso alcanzado en el conocimiento de su fisiopatologia y el desarrollo de novedosas y efectivas tecnicas para su tratamiento, la conducta terapeutica del paciente con dolor agudo es inadecuada.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

The same and other similar situations are everyday experiences for modern humans (1), whose various responses may be psychological and/or physical. Since stress can be caused by environmental as well as psychological factors, it is easy to perceive that there is a relationship between everyday stress and defense mechanisms and disease susceptibility and that the physical and psychological spheres are often both involved in the process. The result is a unitary concept of human pathology, and the problem is to determine the entity of the emotional component in any disease. The body (soma) and the mind (psyche)constitute a single unit, and physicians should do the utmost to consider and treat them as such.",

Les formes pédiatriques de SDRC 1 se distinguent des formes adultes : les douleurs sont majoritairement localisées aux membres inférieurs (cheville, pied) et surviennent après un traumatisme mineur. Les enfants se présentent le plus souvent avec une forme froide d’emblée. Les douleurs entraînent une impotence fonctionnelle majeure et prolongée, ce qui contraste avec l’absence ou la banalité de la lésion sous-jacente. Les retentissements sont rapidement importants et concernent tous les domaines de la vie de l’enfant : perte d’autonomie, troubles du sommeil, anxiété, dépression, altération des liens sociaux et familiaux, absentéisme scolaire…Le diagnostic reste clinique, sur la base des critères de Budapest, même s’ils n’ont pas été validés en pédiatrie. Le traitement repose sur une réhabilitation fonctionnelle grâce à la physiothérapie associée à une prise en charge psychothérapeutique. L’objectif est de remobiliser le membre douloureux de manière progressive et adaptée, sans attendre la sédation complète de la douleur, et de limiter les retentissements de la douleur au quotidien. Les antalgiques peuvent parfois être utiles, mais doivent être surveillés de manière étroite. Cette prise en charge est ambulatoire initialement, mais lorsque les douleurs sont trop intenses et entraînent des retentissements importants, une hospitalisation doit être proposée. Enfin, l’évolution semble meilleure que chez les adultes même si environ 20 % des enfants rechutent dans les six premiers mois le plus souvent.",

      "abstract": "Secondary analyses in a subsample (N = 9160) of the National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program data base revealed that 19.6% of the general population reported one or more depressive symptoms in the previous month. One-year prevalence of two or more depressive symptoms in the general population was 11.8%, a prevalence figure exceeding the 9.5% 1-year prevalence for all the DSM-III mood disorders combined. We have labeled this potential clinical condition as subsyndromal symptomatic depression (SSD), defining it as any two or more simultaneous symptoms of depression, present for most or all of the time, at least 2 weeks in duration, associated with evidence of social dysfunction, occurring in individuals who do not meet criteria for diagnoses of minor depression, major depression, and/or dysthymia. SSD has a 1-year prevalence in the general population of 8.4%, two thirds of whom are women (63.4%). The most common SSD symptoms reported are insomnia (44.7%), feeling tired out all the time (42.1%), recurrent thoughts of death (31.0%), trouble concentrating (22.7%), significant weight gain (18.5%), slowed thinking (15.1%), and hypersomnia (15.1%). Increased prevalence of disability and welfare benefits was found in SSD as compared with respondents with no depressive symptoms. SSD represents a significant clinical population not covered by any DSM-III, DSM-III-R, or DSM-IV mood disorder diagnosis. Since SSD is also associated with significant increases in social dysfunction and disability, we feel there is good evidence to conclude that SSD is an unrecognized clinical condition of considerable public health importance that is deserving of further characterization and study.",

The core feature of these disorders is a level of anxiety and fears that is not appropriate for that stage of development in a child which leads to anxiety disorders having a significant impact on disrupting daily activities of a child. It is important to monitor children’s fears within the context of their development. Estimations show that approximately 10 to 20% of all children develop some kind of anxiety disorders. They are present with the children of both sexes, although some anxiety disorders have shown to be featured more often in girls. Anxiety disorders can be diagnosed after the age of six. Early discovery and proper treatment can significantly help with the possible negative effects these disorders have on social and family life as well as on a child’s performance in school. Anxiety disorders are comorbid conditions with other psychiatric disorders. Anxiety is manifested in the form of bodily, psychological, cognitive and behavioural changes. When it comes to etiology, a variety of factors are present, with the causes of anxiety disorders still not fully known, but both psychiatric and general medical factors are involved. Clinical studies, as well as every day practice, have shown that most effective results yield when cognitive- behavioural therapy (CBT) combined with prescription medication is utilized. Cognitive therapy bases its approach on identifying and replacing negative thinking patterns and behaviours with positive ones while behavioural techniques aim to change behavioural patterns in children with anxiety disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first choice when it comes to medication therapy as they are proven time and time again to be the most effective in anxiety disorders. When diagnosed early and using a proper treatment, anxiety disorders can be reduced to a minimum as to not cause any damage to the child’s life. It is crucial in children and adolescents psychiatry for the success of the treatment for parents or guardians to be heavily involved in all stages of treating the disorder, from planning to practicing techniques proposed by the physician.",

In relation to their physical health, they are often categorized as those who escape, delay, or survive disease. Subjective health ratings are also important, and exceptional survivors typically describe their health as good or even excellent. Functional health and cognitive health, on the other hand, may be more impaired as older adults reach very late life. High levels of depression occur in centenarians but may be explained by higher levels of fatigue. Whether exceptional survivors should be considered “successful agers” very much depends on the definition of successful aging.",

      "abstract": "Sexual assault as a major psychological trauma and a crime of violence evokes immediate symptoms of posttraumatic stress and, for many victims, long-term posttraumatic psychological sequelae. The victim, as the recipient of the rapist's anger and need to control, experiences terror, fear of death, and helplessness. This results in classic posttraumatic symptoms of haunting, intrusive recollections, numbing or constriction of feelings and focus, and increased arousal. When this psychological trauma is not integrated, anxiety, depression, phobias, impaired sexual and social adjustment, negative self-image, and diminished capacity to enjoy life follow. Concepts of posttraumatic stress are reviewed and a definition of sexual assault is offered. The posttraumatic stress response to sexual assault is considered under the phases of response and symptoms, followed by the psychodynamics of this particular psychic trauma. A brief overview of treatment is outlined.",

L’enuresie nocturne (plus de 2 fois par semaine) toucherait 8 % des enfants de moins de 4 ans et demi et 1,5 % des enfants de moins de 9 ans et demi. Elle peut persister jusqu’a 19 ans… Le NICE rappelle qu’il ne s’agit pas d’une « faute» et que les « punitions » n’ont aucun role therapeutique… Il faut donc d’abord informer les enfants et leurs familles et leur donner des conseils pratiques immediats pour limiter l’impact (protections et vetements de nuit adaptes). Une enuresie recente doit faire rechercher une infection urinaire ou un diabete ; apres quelques mois de possibles facteurs declenchants (maladie recente, trouble emotionnel…) qui peuvent necessiter une prise en charge specifique. L’evaluation est multifactorielle (symptomes de jour, autres problemes, notamment de constipation, troubles du developpement, du comportement, de l’attention ou de l’apprentissage, problemes familiaux…). Une evaluation en milieu specialise peut etre indispensable en cas d’incontinence diurne, d’antecedents d’infection urinaire, d’anomalies congenitales ou de troubles comportementaux majeurs, notamment en cas de suspicion de maltraitance. Le NICE recommande de ne pas restreindre les apports hydriques de la journee, ne pas reveiller l’enfant la nuit, sauf circonstances exceptionnelles, de lui rappeler d’utiliser les toilettes a heures regulieres durant la journee. La place des differents traitements alarmes, desmopressine en premiere intention, recours a un avis specialise en cas d’echec avant utilisation d’anticholinergiques ou d’imipramine, est bien precisee. Le NICE rappelle qu’il est habituellement inutile d’envisager un traitement avant l’âge de 7 ans, meme si certaines mesures peuvent etre envisagees a partir de 5 ans. 1.

In a significant proportion of individuals, however, recovery may be impaired, leading to long-term pathological disturbances. The most common of these is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A range of other disorders may also be seen after trauma, and there is considerable overlap between PTSD symptoms and several other psychiatric conditions. Risk factors for PTSD include severe exposure to the trauma, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and a history of psychiatric illness. Although PTSD may resolve in the majority of cases, in some cases risk factors outweigh protective factors, and symptoms may persist for many years. PTSD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse, and with physical (somatization) symptoms. There is growing evidence that PTSD does not merely represent a normal response to stress, but rather is mediated by specific neurobiological dysfunctions.",

Vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, including depression, involves the interplay of genetic, biochemical, and psychosocial/environmental forces.\n\n2. The “core” symptoms of depression are the same for children and adults, but the prevalence of certain symptoms can vary with age.\n\n3. Evidence suggests that early-onset major depression is associated with especially high levels of psychiatric comorbidity, a protracted course, a poorer outcome, and a high probability of significant functional impairment.\n\n4. Suicide risk factors are common to a wide range of distressed children and adolescents and are not specific to suicide.\n\n5. There is no way to predict suicide among depressed children and adolescents, except in those who have made previous attempts.\n\nPediatricians are confronted daily with a wide array of psychosocial issues.Whether it’s the preschooler crying and complaining of stomach aches before leaving for child care, the young adolescent skipping school, or the older teenager abusing substances, pediatricians often are put in the difficult position of having to decide if problem behaviors and emotions are“ normal variations,” developmental transitions, temperamental manifestations, or primary symptoms of a serious psychiatric disorder. Mood disturbances and depressive states often represent a diagnostic dilemma to the primary care physician.\n\nSadness is common and is an appropriate response to loss (eg, death of a loved one), divorce, or separation. Although the initial sadness following loss may fade over time, children often revisit their sadness in later years. Normal adaptation involves a gradual acceptance of the loss and an incorporation of this reality into the child’s life experience. Some children will reconfigure the memory of the deceased through pictures or momentos in a process called memorialization. Other children (and adults) may carry on a silent dialogue with the deceased, trying to imagine how this person would have reacted at key times during the child’s life (eg, graduations, weddings).

When a person starts using drugs, it starts getting addicted to them and gradually it can’t help but act on the impulse to use them regardless of the damage caused to the body of addicted person. Drug isn’t about just illegal drugs. A person can get addicted to alcohol, painkillers, nicotine and other legal substances. Drug addiction is a deathly disease found in almost every year of age. The disease is mostly carried by people who are mentally frustrated, physically or mentally abused, facing financial problem or family problems and is desperate to get some sort of relief that comes with the high of drugs even if it proves to be grim for their health in the long run. Addiction starts with the continuous use of dosage of any drug, until the point that an individual starts feeling anxious without the availability of them. Slowly and painfully, these drugs starts making a person totally relied on them and it is basically impossible for the individual to survive without them. There can be many reasons as to why an individual decides to go on this path of addiction. Economic problems, state of utter sadness in case of the death of a loved one or a closed one, societal stress, isolation, aggression, bad or wrong company, in state of depression and anxiety are the most likely situations in which a person starts taking drugs. Along with many other factors, families often play a vital role in pushing an individual towards seeking comfort and relief from the drugs. Developing countries like Pakistan and many others are facing the problem as there are not many effective and active rehabilitation centers. In this research article, the role of families contributing in an individual’s drug addiction is elaborated. This research article is done with the help of many researches, as well as some interviews were conducted regarding certain factors and the answers were given according to the observation and views of responders. The conclusion is drawn with the help of articles and personal opinions and observations regarding how a person leans toward substance or drug usage because of certain family issues and problems.",

The syndrome is most often produced by concurrent use of two or more drugs that enhance serotonin neurotransmission. Monotherapy may also elicit the syndrome. We report the development of serotonin syndrome with a fatal outcome in a patient treated with paroxetin++. Interactions with alimemazin++, melperon++ and karbamazepin may have contributed to the outcome. The serotonin syndrome usually resolves within 24 hours when the suspected drugs are discontinued.

Im Gegensatz zu Erschöpfungszuständen bei Gesunden ist diese Form der Fatigue dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass sie über längere Zeiträume andauern kann, in keinem angemessenen Verhältnis zu vorangehenden Aktivitäten steht und sich durch Erholungsphasen nicht zurückbildet. Diese Form der Müdigkeit wird als ein multidimensionales Problem beschrieben, das physische, emotionale und kognitive Aspekte umfasst und mit einem hohen subjektiven Leidensdruck verbunden ist. Je nach Ausprägung und Verlauf der Symptomatik führt Fatigue zu einer starken Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität und schränkt die Teilhabe und Alltagsbewältigung ein. Ebenso kommt es häufig zu Einschränkungen der Arbeits- und Erwerbsfähigkeit. Wenngleich die Ursachen der Fatigue immer noch nicht vollständig geklärt sind, ist die Fatigue in Zusammenhang mit körperlichen Erkrankungen vor dem Hintergrund eines multifaktoriellen biopsychosozialen Modells zu verstehen. Die Möglichkeiten der Diagnostik und eine Übersicht über verschiedene Verfahren zur Abklärung der Fatigue werden dargestellt.

Maka kesehatan mental yang baik itu, berarti mempunyai perasaan positif tentang diri sendiri, mampu menyelesaikan masalah dan tekanan hidup sehari-hari, dan bisa membentuk dan menjaga hubungan baik dengan orang lain.

      "title": "PROGNOSIS IN MANIC-DEPRESSIVE PSYCHOSES",
      "abstract": "A follow-up study of 208 manic-depressive conditions is reported. Analysis of such conditions permits the following summary. Positive heredity is common—chiefly depressions, and more commonly in the direct line of heredity. This shows more consistently in the manic cases. Characteristic personality type is outgoing. Unexplainable psychosis is rare (20 per cent). Most have disturbing circumstances at the time of onset. Oldest and youngest siblings may more frequently develop psychoses. Somatic handicaps frequently contribute to or help to precipitate the illness. Abrupt onset is rare except in manics. The condition usually requires one to six months to develop. Suicidal risk or attempt occurred in 30 per cent of all cases. The affective picture is often mixed, not purely as sadness or elation. Psychoneurotic (not often as anxiety), schizophrenic, and arteriosclerotic components are frequent (79 cases). (33.1 per cent). Thinking disturbances are present in one-fourth of the cases (manic and depressive phases). Capacity for rapport is fair or good in 41 per cent of the manics and in 70 per cent of the depressions. Some insight is present in 47 per cent of the manics and in 54 per cent of the depressions. Remissions of 10-20 years are common (67 cases, 32.2 per cent). Depression may begin early, but rarely (3.8 per cent, 8 cases), or late (65+, 11 cases, 5.2 per cent). The largest incidence occurs in the decade 45-55. Course is a matter of months; on the average 2½ months in the hospital. Three-fourths of the cases are well or improved at the time of discharge; 93 per cent recover from the first attack. Chronic cases are rare (16, 7.7 per cent). Cyclothymic cases tend oftener to chronicity. Single attacks are rare (21 per cent). Recurrence is likely. Long-term follow-up convinces us that caution is necessary in pronouncing recovery for the future. Seventy-nine per cent had recurrences. This is particularly true for cyclothymic cases. Many variations in course and phases occur. Depression following elation is more common than vice versa. Depression almost always lurks behind elation. Manic patients may suicide. Depressive or paranoid content occurred in 14 of the manic cases (77.7 per cent). Depressive cases may show definite manic features (spurts of elation in the morning, rhyming and flight with sadness). Single attacks of manic psychosis are very rare. Single attacks of depression occurred in 40 cases (19.2 per cent). Fourteen of these became chronic (35 per cent of 40 and 6.8 per cent of 208). The unfavorable depressions may develop a schizophrenic picture. Deterioration may occur in depression. Stupor in depression occurs—catatonic in appearance. First attacks on the average last 6½ months. Recovery from first attack is almost invariable (93 per cent). Twenty-one per cent had single attacks; 79 per cent had recurrent illnesses; 63.5 per cent had third attacks, and 45.1 per cent had fourth attacks. Attacks tend to become prolonged as they recur, especially after 45. Best prospect for recovery for patients having first attack is between 21 and 30, poorer after 40, worst after 50. Recovered patients show small number of attacks (2.7) and shortening of the course in subsequent attacks. The more frequent the attacks, the less chance for ultimate recovery. Depth of psychosis is not significantly important. Negative heredity is not an outstanding factor in recovery. Out-going make-up is a factor in recovered cases.",

      "abstract": "Apresentacao : A expectativa de vida da populacao idosa vem aumentado sensivelmente de forma mais acelerada que a de qualquer outra faixa etaria. Este fatopode estar relacionado, as acoes de saude publica, mudancas comportamentais, alem dos avancos nas pesquisas cientificas e recursos tecnologicos na area da saude. Com o avanco da idade, ocorre tambem a chegada de doencas cronicas nao transmissiveis, como a depressao. A depressao e uma sindrome de natureza multifatorial, que se caracteriza pela associacao de condicoes clinicas e psiquicas, tendo como principais sintomas o humor deprimido e o isolamento de forma gradual e continua. Na populacao idosa, a depressao associa-se ao proprio processo de envelhecimento (deficits fisicos e cognitivos relacionados a idade) e a comorbidades, uso continuado de alguns medicamentos, adversidades emocionais e mudancas de estilo de vida. Por outro lado, a depressao piora a comorbidade, diminuindo a qualidade de vida e aumentando a mortalidade. Esse trabalho tem como objetivo relatar a abordagem com um grupo de pessoas idosas sobre depressao na terceira idade. Desenvolvimento do trabalho: Relato de experiencia tendo como abordagem utilizada a roda de conversa. A acao educativa foi realizada comoito idosos, integrantes do grupo UnAPI (Universidade aberta a pessoa Idosa), da Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul.O grupo proporciona diversas atividades que priorizam a educacao em saude, alem da troca de conhecimento entre os idosos e discentes dos mais diversos cursos de graduacao da UFMS.A acao educativa foi realizada no dia 2 de agosto de 2017. Resultados: Foi iniciado com uma apresentacao e avaliacao do grau de conhecimento previo a respeito da depressao, posteriormente abordamos o mesmo tema , dando enfoque na epidemiologia da doenca, principais sinais e sintomas e tratamento.Notou-se a participacao constante dos integrantes no decorrer da atividade educativa, havendo uma boa integracao entre os mesmos, onde relataram suas vivencias pessoais e de conhecidos com depressao, demonstrando interesse nos esclarecimentos de duvidas quanto ao tema tratado. Consideracoes finais: Abordar temas emergentes de saude como a depressao, tem se mostrado de grande valia na conquista de autonomia em saude da populacao idosa. Os idosos participantes da acao apresentaram diversas duvidas e relataram suas experiencias acerca do tema, tal fato mostra que os mesmos nao estao alienados no que tange o assunto. Pode-se observar atraves desta acao, que as vivencias individuais e a maneira de como e realizado o enfrentamento dos problemas cotidianos interferem intrinsicamente na qualidade de vida e na prevencao da depressao na terceira idade. A abordagem do tema para com este publico se mostra necessaria e pertinente, servindo como medida terapeutica e educativa nos campos da saude mental.",

Comorbidity describes the effect of all other conditions an individual patient might have other than the primary condition of interest, and can be physiological or psychological. In the context of mental health, comorbidity often refers to disorders that are often coexistent with each other, such as depression and anxiety disorders. Comorbidity can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously, but independently with another condition or a related derivative medical condition. The latter sense of the term causes some overlap with the concept of complications. For example, in longstanding diabetes mellitus, the extent to which coronary artery disease is an independent comorbidity versus a diabetic complication is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence. The same is true…",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Mrs Yeo, a 68-year-old woman, came to you for chronic back pain, which had been persistent for the past year. She had been doctor-hopping, hoping to find an effective pain relief. About 6 months ago, she visited an orthopaedics specialist, who diagnosed her with degenerative disc disease and offered surgery, but she was not keen. Due to the back pain, Mrs Yeo stopped her part-time job 3 months ago and had been staying home more often instead of participating in community activities or interacting with her neighbours. She expressed hopelessness and lamented about the impact of the back pain on her function and lifestyle.WHAT IS CHRONIC PAIN? Chronic pain refers to pain that lasts for more than 3 months and persists past normal healing time. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, pain is defined as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage\". It is always a personal experience that is influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological and social factors.[1] The perception of pain is often affected by personal life experiences, emotional factors, personal belief systems and family upbringing and values. HOW COMMON IS THIS IN MY PRACTICE? About 8.7% of the Singapore population experiences chronic pain.[2] Within this subset, a higher prevalence of chronic pain is present among females (10.9%) and it increases significantly among people above 65 years old. Chronic pain is a risk factor for psychological disorders. A Singapore cross-sectional epidemiological survey showed that chronic pain is significantly associated with major depressive disorder (odds ratio 2.4) and generalised anxiety disorder (odds ratio 3.0).[3] The economic effects of chronic pain are substantial. Another local cross-sectional study showed that episodic migraine alone posed an economic burden of SGD 1 billion per year, translating to about 2% of total government healthcare expenditure in Singapore.[4] HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE? With Singapore's ageing population, the prevalence of chronic pain is expected to increase, and it will be beneficial for family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) to manage uncomplicated chronic pain conditions. Complex cases may still eventually require a pain specialist's review. Chronic pain is challenging to manage in primary care. Although there are few studies conducted on the local practice of chronic pain management, some common barriers have been identified. In a local qualitative study, fellow physicians in Singapore shared that a considerable number of physicians still view chronic pain in a biomedical model rather than a biopsychosocial model. In addition, the older community often feels stigmatised or views it negatively when offered psychological treatments for chronic pain. This lack of public awareness also deters physicians from referring older persons for psychological treatment. Keeping a close and therapeutic relationship with patients, involving the family members and having consistent graduated patient education on the multifaceted nature of chronic pain were found to be helpful.[5] In our local context, chronic pain management may incur considerable costs, especially in the aspect of psychological treatment, which may not be covered under government subsidy schemes such as Medisave. This, in turn, can further deter patients from pursuing holistic treatment. FPs and GPs can look into these factors and better reach out to patients. In this article, we aim to shed light on the range of management strategies available to manage chronic pain conditions [Box 1]. Chronic pain management is complex to manage in a primary care setting and it often requires multidisciplinary co-management (FP or GP, pain specialist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and psychologist) with the necessary patient empowerment and link-up with community resources.Box 1: Common chronic non-cancer pain conditions.WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Chronic and acute pain management has some similarities, although their management differs in some regard due to the different pathophysiologies. Besides the underlying nociceptive or neuropathic pain, the perception of pain and suffering is often contributed by psychological factors, personal beliefs, life experiences and social factors such as financial struggles or litigation.[6] It should be ingrained into our daily practice to elicit and address the root causes to manage chronic pain effectively. Figure 1 shows a brief overview of an approach that can be applied in primary care. For patients with chronic pain lasting from months to years, the priority is not to eliminate pain completely, as this is often ambitious to achieve, but to improve function and quality of life. Chronic pain should be treated with a multimodal 4 'P's approach, which are Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (Physical, Psychological and Procedural) strategies. These strategies can be initiated early and concurrently for greater effectiveness and to instill confidence in the doctor–patient relationship.Figure 1: Chart shows the overview of approach to chronic pain in primary care.Non-pharmacological therapy The pathophysiology in chronic pain commonly involves central sensitisation and may be associated with underlying psychiatric conditions. Chronic pain management can be effective with non-pharmacological interventions such as physiotherapy, yoga, mindfulness, exercise, heat and cold application therapy, acupuncture, patient education and empowerment. However, the effect of these interventions was reported to be either immediate or short term, which suggests that non-pharmacological interventions should be done regularly for a sustained effect.[7] A typical physiotherapy course consists of two or three sessions each week for a duration of 8–12 weeks. Failure to show improvement within this time frame should prompt the physician to reconsider if physiotherapy is still recommended.[8] However, in the local context, due to exceeding demand for subsidised physiotherapy services, public healthcare institutions are unable to accommodate two or three sessions per week for each patient. These limited resources can be made more available and efficient by educating and empowering patients with the right mindset and attitudes towards exercise regime. Empowerment can further enable patients to sustain the efforts and reap its benefits. Pharmacological therapy Chronic pain can be broadly classified into nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. Generally, nociceptive pain is sharp and well localised, while neuropathic pain is characterised by paraesthesia (numbing, shooting, cramping sensation) and may be poorly localised. Occasionally, patients may present with both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Among patients who have end-stage knee or hip osteoarthritis, which is traditionally understood as nociceptive pain, about 35% of women and 27% of men have pain features that are suggestive of neuropathic knee pain.[9] This dichotomy can assist FPs and GPs to prescribe the appropriate pharmacological therapy. Typically, all pain should be treated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) pain guidelines, starting with non-opioid modalities to weak opioids and escalating to opioid therapy, with gabapentinoids and antidepressants conventionally reserved for neuropathic pain. If the pain is mild, a single analgesia can be given. For moderate or severe pain, combining multiple analgesic agents should be considered. These combination therapies have synergistic effects, which allow for lower doses of each analgesia and reduce the risks of adverse effects of each analgesia. When initiating treatment, the efficacy can be assessed after 2–4 weeks. If deemed ineffective, the medication can be switched to an alternative agent, reduced or withdrawn. The effect of pharmacological therapy is short-lived, and this may encourage patient reliance on medications in the long term, leading to higher risks of adverse effects. Hence, treatment often needs to be individualised, directed according to patients' functional limitations and goals, and kept as short a period as possible [Table 1].Table 1: Overview of common non-opioid pharmacological agents.[ 10 ]Opioid therapy Discussion surrounding opioid therapy should include the common side effects and the increased risks of opioid dependence and abuse. In line with the recent release of the Ministry of Health Opioid Guidelines, long-term opioid therapy should not be routinely prescribed.[11] If a patient is started on opioid therapy, regular assessments of the patient's response should be conducted. The doctor should consider ceasing the therapy if there is no improvement in the quality of life or achievement of functional outcomes, or if there is any suspicion of abuse. The risk factors of opioid therapy include developing comorbidities such as major depression and psychosis, suicidal tendencies and substance abuse. There are several scoring systems for prediction of aberrant use before initiation of opioid therapy, such as the 'Opioid Risk Tool' and the 'Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain' (SOAPP).[12] With these screening tools, the risks of aberrant behaviour from opioid use can be stratified as low risk, moderate risk or high risk. Low-risk patients are generally deemed reasonable to start opioid therapy in primary care. High-risk patients should be referred to pain specialist for further management. Procedural treatment Lastly, there are various types of procedures that can help manage chronic pain, such as injections and nerve blocks. Patients who are suffering from chronic back pain due to disc herniation, spinal stenosis, discogenic pain or post-surgery syndrome may benefit from having epidural injections.[13] There is debatable evidence for intra-articular injectables for the management of chronic knee osteoarthritis.[14] Timely referral to tertiary pain specialists and, hence, access to these procedures can help to provide synergistic effort in managing chronic pain. As a result, patients can achieve significant improvement in pain control, which will strengthen their adherence to subsequent treatments. HOW CAN I PROVIDE MORE HOLISTIC MANAGEMENT? Patients with chronic pain often have associated psychological complications such as depression and anxiety, and face social issues such as unemployment. This is especially prominent among patients with a low socioeconomic status. A local study showed that a person with chronic pain is twice as likely to face unemployment compared to a person of similar socioeconomic status without chronic pain.[15] It is challenging for FPs and GPs to thoroughly address these issues in a time-efficient manner. However, FPs and GPs can value-add by improving communication with tertiary centres, highlighting new issues and working together to best manage these psychosocial issues. There are several support groups available for patients and their caregivers, such as the Knee Osteoarthritis Improvement Group for patients with knee osteoarthritis and the Autoimmune Diseases Support Group for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. TOUCH Community Services also has a community musculoskeletal clinic which is mainly run by physiotherapists. Patients facing employment woes can also approach government agencies such as Workforce Singapore, which provides training opportunities, career guidance and links to job openings. The Skillsfuture programme provides a platform to access courses and training to improve employability. National Arthritis Foundation is a charitable body which raises funds to be utilised as financial subsidies for financially needy patients for treatment or to enhance employment prospects. In addition, patient's mental well-being often suffers along with the chronic pain. Chronic pain can also bring about friction among family members as patients assume the sick role. With multiple facets of life affected, these patients may find it difficult to access help and have respite. FPs and GPs can suggest and link up the patients with available community resources. Besides the Samaritans of Singapore hotline, there are various avenues for counselling that may be helpful [Table 2]. These organisations include Silver Ribbon Singapore, which offers free basic counselling services, and Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), which provides in-person counselling sessions. Other organisations may have religious roots, in which some patients may find the counselling more relatable. These include Shan You, an organisation with buddhist roots, and Calvary Community Care, which was founded by a church. Typically, churches have volunteers who provide help with counselling as well.Table 2: Summary of community resources.*WHEN SHOULD I REFER TO A SPECIALIST? Doctors should refer their patients to a specialist in these scenarios: (a) the patient has persistent pain that significantly impacts on function and quality of life or causes anxiety and/or depression, and has not responded to initial management; (b) the patient continues to seek medical treatment for persistent pain that cannot be explained; (c) the patient is a possible candidate for interventional treatment; (d) the patient requires high-dose opioid therapy, shows possible opioid dependence or has a moderate-to-high risk of opioid dependence based on risk screening tools; and (e) the patient needs multimodal treatment not available in a primary care setting. TAKE-HOME MESSAGES Elucidate the cause of the pain. If the chronic pain is secondary to a mechanical pathology (i.e. spinal stenosis or osteoarthritis), explore if surgical options have been discussed. Chronic non-cancer pain often has many facets. Considering the biopsychosocial aspects of the presentation can help to identify various contributing factors and provide effective treatment. 4 'P's management: Pharmacological, Physical, Psychological and Procedural. There are numerous pharmacological treatments available, and these medications can be directed based on the type of pain and the underlying contributing disease. Opioid therapy is often associated with adverse effects, misuse and dependence. Utilising risk screening tools and regular monitoring can help to reduce these problems and allow for early detection and intervention. Patients should be empowered through patient education and understand the various treatments for better management of chronic pain. Consider other non-pharmacological treatments as a multimodal approach, especially for patients who may not be suitable for surgical treatment and aggressive pharmacological treatment due to its adverse effects. Consider psychosocial implications of chronic pain and offer management options for more holistic care. Timely referral to a tertiary centre should be considered and made in the above-mentioned situations. Closing Vignette You found out that Mrs Yeo had mild depression brought on by the chronic back pain and the resultant functional limitations. She had previously been trialled on paracetamol and short courses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. You started her on combination therapy, including duloxetine, and explained to her about the biopsychosocial nature of chronic pain. On review, Mrs Yeo's pain had improved, although it was still causing functional limitations. You referred her to a pain specialist for consideration of procedural treatment, as well as a physiotherapist and psychologist. After 3 months, Mrs Yeo reported that she was feeling much better and was now able to better ambulate in the community.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "We discuss comorbidity, continuity, and discontinuity of anxiety-related disorders from the perspective of a two-dimensional neuropsychology of fear (threat avoidance) and anxiety (threat approach). Pharmacological dissection of the \"neurotic\" disorders justifies both a categorical division between fear and anxiety and a subdivision of each mapped to a hierarchy of neural modules that process different immediacies of threat. It is critical that each module can generate normal responses, symptoms of another syndrome, or syndromal responses. We discuss the resultant possibilities for comorbid dysfunction of these modules both with each other and with some disorders not usually classified as anxiety related. The simplest case is symptomatic fear/anxiety comorbidity, where dysfunction in one module results in excess activity in a second, otherwise normal, module to generate symptoms and apparent comorbidity. More complex is syndromal fear/anxiety comorbidity, where more than one module is concurrently dysfunctional. Yet more complex are syndromal comorbidities of anxiety that go beyond the two dimensional fear/anxiety systems: depression, substance use disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Our account of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-anxiety comorbidity entails discussion of the neuropsychology of externalizing disorders to account for the lack of anxiety comorbidity in some of these. Finally, we link the neuropsychology of disorder to personality variation, and to the development of a biomarker of variation in the anxiety system among individuals that, if extreme, may provide a means of unambiguously identifying the first of a range of anxiety syndromes.",

In this article, the concepts and means used to assess the latter while developing the Radiumhemmet scale for symptom assessment are described. The focus is on the subjective long-term situation, and symptoms as a perceived abnormality are defined. For conceptual clarity, one symptom at a time is considered, excluding scales in which items are summarized. Moreover, measures of disease occurrence in the population are translated (epidemiologically) into measures of symptom occurrence in an individual. Nature distinguishes one long-term symptom from another. Occurrence of a symptom in an individual is measured by an incidence (e.g. number of defecations per week) or prevalence rate (e.g. urinations with involuntary cessation divided by the total number of urinations). Any scale expressing symptom intensity is arbitrary, be it 'verbal' (no/little/moderate/much pain) or visual (analogue or with integers). A time period describes symptom duration. The relevance of a symptom to emotions and social activities, sometimes cited as the associated symptom-induced distress, is a separate issue from symptom occurrence, intensity, and duration.",

Whereas drug use starts out as controlled, casual use, during the development of the addiction syndrome, drug seeking and taking escalates into a compulsive mode of behavior. This is reflected by the criteria in DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), in which five out of seven symptoms signify that control over drug intake has been lost: [Substance dependence is .. . ] a maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by three (or more) of the following, occurring at any time in the same 12-month period.",

      "abstract": "The physical symptoms attending the general paralysis of the insane have been shown to present in their progress three well-defined stages. Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

      "title": "Evaluación del efecto antidepresivo del secretoma derivado de células madre mesenquimáticas precondicionadas en un modelo animal de trastorno depresivo mayor",
      "abstract": "El trastorno depresivo mayor es un desorden heterogéneo y multifactorial caracterizado por episodios de al menos dos semanas de duración, en los cuales se presente al menos uno de los dos síntomas centrales. Estos son: 1.- Estado de ánimo depresivo con pérdida de interés por las actividades cotidianas y 2.- Ausencia de la capacidad de sentir placer (anhedonia). Estos síntomas traen consigo trastornos anímicos, cognitivos y fisiológicos y en los casos más severos, pueden asociarse a conductas suicidas. Si bien en la actualidad la etiología del trastorno depresivo mayor es poco conocida, se ha reportado que tanto la presencia de neuroinflamación como la reducción de la neurogénesis hipocampal adulta son eventos claves en el desarrollo de esta patología. Las terapias actuales para el trastorno depresivo mayor no están enfocadas en estas alteraciones, lo que podría explicar el alto porcentaje de refractariedad al tratamiento de pacientes con trastorno depresivo mayor frente a la terapia convencional. Por este motivo, se ha propuesto como una opción de tratamiento el uso de células madre mesenquimáticas (MSC), las cuales son capaces de producir de manera paracrina, una gran variedad de moléculas terapéuticas entre las que se encuentran moléculas anti-inflamatorias y factores neuroprotectores inductores de la neurogénesis. Estas moléculas secretadas por las MSC se pueden recuperar desde el medio de cultivo celular y en conjunto reciben el nombre de secretoma. Este trabajo se basó en la evaluación del potencial antidepresivo de la administración intranasal repetida de secretoma derivado de MSC en un modelo animal de trastorno depresivo mayor instaurado en el bioterio de la Universidad del Desarrollo. En conjunto, los datos obtenidos muestran que el tratamiento intranasal con secretoma derivado de MSC fue capaz de revertir algunas de las conductas asociadas a estados depresivos en animales, disminuyendo significativamente el puntaje global de depresión en comparación a los animales tratados con vehículo. A nivel estructural el modelo animal de depresión utilizado no mostró presencia de alteraciones del proceso de neurogenesis hipocampal adulta pero sí mostró neuroinflamación, evidenciada en un aumento de la densidad de astrocitos a nivel del hipocampo en comparación a los animales control. Este aumento no se observó en los animales tratados con secretoma intranasal, sugiriendo un efecto anti-inflamatorio del biofármaco. Adicionalmente, se observó que el secretoma derivado de MSC ejerció un efecto protector sobre los astrocitos inhibiendo el proceso de atrofia de sus prolongaciones. Los datos pre-clínicos obtenidos sugieren que la administración intranasal de secretoma derivado de células madre mesenquimáticas representa un tratamiento potencialmente eficaz para reducir los síntomas de depresión en humanos y una posible alternativa terapéutica a los tratamientos actuales para esta devastadora patología",

      "abstract": "Ayurveda has the most ingenious approach to achieve complete health as it doesn’t leave any domain unattained, especially mental health. Rajas &amp; Tamas Manas Dosha are responsible for all the psychic disorders including Anxiety which is usually characterized by hyperactivity, state of excessive worry, fear and poor decision-making ability. Its psychopathology affects humans on somatic level as well. Mental health concerns touch most people’s lives directly or indirectly, it can affect a person’s work productivity, their personal and professional lives and in severe cases destroy their quality of life. Ayurveda takes two approaches Drug therapy like use of Medhya Rasayan, through internal as well as external method which enhances the function of intellect &amp; non-drug therapy like Aachar Rasayan, Satwavajaya Chikitsa &amp; Yoga therapy. Anxiety is more chronic as it often overshadowed by other health conditions like GIT problems. Hence exploring presenting problem involving mind-body relationship and finding a synergistic solution is the need of the hour, to reduce the stigma associated with it, by understanding Anxiety in depth from Ayurveda’s point of view.",

The mechanism of this syndrome has not been clarified, but several factors have been proposed as follows: 1) the weakness of Zeitgeber 2) decrease of sensitivity to Zeitgeber 3) the period of the circadian system is much longer than 24 hours.

Some of these symptoms disappear quickly, whereas others persist. This chapter focuses mostly on symptoms that cannot be easily understood from a solely biomedical perspective, the so-called functional somatic symptoms (FSS). The symptoms referred to as FSS are comprised of varying combinations of pain in different parts of the body, functional disturbances attributed to organs like cardiovascular or gastrointestinal dysfunctions or dizziness, and symptoms surrounding fatigue. Their main characteristics, pathophysiology, and etiology are briefly discussed. In addition, the authors discuss the relation between FSS and the current DSM classification of somatic symptom disorder and other related diagnostic categories.",

      "title": "Padma 28 bei Restless-Legs-Syndrom: Fallberichte wecken Hoffnungen auf Wirksamkeit",
      "abstract": "Beim sogenannten Restless-Legs-Syndrom (RLS) handelt es sich um eine neurologische, sensomotorische Störung, welche sich unter anderem durch Symptome wie Gefühlsstörungen und Bewegungsdrang in den Extremitäten äussert. Meist sind die Beine stärker betroffen als die Arme, und es kann neben den Empfindungsstörungen auch zu unwillkürlichen Bewegungen der betroffenen Körperpartien kommen. Folgende vier Symptome müssen für eine klinische Diagnose des RLS vorhanden sein: - Missempfindungen mit Bewegungsdrang;- motorische Unruhe;- verstärktes Auftreten der Beschwerden in Ruhephase und sofortige Verbesserung bei Bewegung;- gehäuftes Auftreten der Symptome gegen Abend bzw. in der Nacht.Man unterscheidet zwischen einer idiopathischen und einer symptomatischen Form des RLS. Die symptomatische Form tritt gehäuft bei verschiedenen Erkrankungen wie Eisenmangel, Diabetes mellitus, Polyneuro- pathie, rheumatoide Arthritis und chronisch venöse Insuffizienz sowie auch in der Schwangerschaft auf. Weiter können Medikamente wie Dopaminantagonisten und Antidepressiva ein RLS auslösen. Die idiopathische Form wird zu 30-92% familiär vererbt, wobei ein autosomal-dominanter Erbgang angenommen wird [1].Das RLS ist eine der häufigsten neurologischen Krankheiten. Seine Prävalenz beträgt in Westeuropa und in den USA etwa 7%. Die Ausprägung der Symptome erstreckt sich über einen weiten Bereich von «kaum bemerkbar» bis «schlafraubend». Da die Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität durch stärker ausgeprägte Symptome erheblich ist (Schlafmangel, Müdigkeit, Konzentrationsschwierigkeiten), suchen viele Betroffene Rat bei medizinischen Fachpersonen.Das therapeutische Spektrum zur Behandlung des RLS umfasst neben der Behandlung der zugrunde liegenden Krankheit das Absetzen möglicher «triggernder» Medikamente, den Verzicht auf Genussdrogen am Abend (Koffein, Nikotin, Alkohol), das Lösen kognitiver Aufgaben vor dem Schlafengehen sowie physiotherapeutische Übungen. Klassische pharmakotherapeutische Massnahmen bei RLS beinhalten Levodopa, Dopaminagonisten, Antiepileptika, Antiparkinsonika und Opiate - allerdings alle mit entsprechend hohem Nebenwirkungspotenzial. Viele Patienten sind trotz des hohen Leidensdrucks nicht gewillt, sich einer solchen Therapie zu unterziehen. Die Nachfrage und der Wunsch nach alternativen Behandlungsoptionen sind deshalb gross.Padma 28 ist ein pflanzliches Arzneimittel, das in der Schweiz nach den Prinzipien der Tibetischen Medizin hergestellt wird und aus 22 Komponenten besteht. Es wird in der Schweiz von der Zusatzversicherung erstattet, das identische Präparat Padmed Circosan von der Grundversicherung.Dieses tibetische Vielstoffgemisch wird bei Parästhesien wie Kribbeln, Ameisenlaufen, Schwere- und Spannungsgefühl in den Beinen und Armen, Einschlafen von Händen und Füssen und Wadenkrämpfen eingesetzt. Diese Symptome können sowohl durch arterielle Durchblutungsstörungen als auch durch eine gestörte venöse Mikrozirkulation im Gewebe verursacht werden. Die von der Swissmedic zugelassenen Indikationen sind: Durchblutungsstörungen wie Kribbeln, Einschlafen von Händen und Füssen, Schwere- und Spannungsgefühl von Beinen und Armen, Wadenkrämpfe.Es gibt Fallberichte, die darauf schliessen lassen, dass Padma 28 bei Erkrankungen wirksam ist, die ein symptomatisches RLS begünstigen oder auslösen können. Da die jeweiligen Erkrankungen in dieser Zeitschrift schon ausführlich vorgestellt wurden, sollen diese im Folgenden nur nochmals kurz erwähnt werden.In einem Fallbericht aus einer Schweizer Allgemeinpraxis [2] wurden 2 Fälle vorgestellt, bei denen Padma 28 bei Parästhesien Linderung schaffen konnte. In einem der Fälle litt ein 68-jähriger Diabetes-Patient (Typ 1) zusätzlich auch an PAVK (periphere arterielle Verschlusskrankheit) Fontaine-Stadium IIb. Er wurde mit Insulin und zusätzlich mit Azetylsalizylsäure 100 mg/Tag behandelt. Aufgrund von Gefühlsstörungen in den Füssen und Schmerzen in den Beinen erhielt der Patient zusätzlich 3 × 2 Tabletten (die galenische Form von Padma 28 und Padmed Circosan wurde inzwischen von Tabletten auf Kapseln gewechselt)/Tag Padma 28. Nach 6 Wochen waren die Beschwerden von mittelstarker auf schwache Intensität zurückgegangen. Nach weiteren 3,5 Monaten war der Patient beschwerdefrei. Deshalb wurde die Dosierung auf 3 × 1 Tablette/Tag reduziert. In den nächsten 8 Monaten reichte diese Erhaltungsdosis aus; die Beschwerden traten nie wieder auf. Die Dosierung wurde präventiv weitergeführt.In einem weiteren Fall litt ein 57-jähriger Diabetes-Patient (Typ 2) (Metformin 1000 mg/Tag sowie Pioglitazon 30 mg/Tag) unter mittelstarken Parästhesien in den Füssen und Dysästhesien in den Händen. Auch dieser Patient erhielt 3 × 2 Tabletten/Tag Padma 28. Dank einer deutlichen Besserung der Beschwerden wurde nach 6 Wochen die Dosis auf 2 × 1 Tablette/Tag reduziert. Nach weiteren 6 Wochen war der Patient beschwerdefrei. Die Erhaltungsdosis wurde weitergeführt.Auch dieser Fallbericht stammt aus einer Schweizer Allgemeinpraxis [3]. Hier handelte es sich um eine 71-jährige Patientin, die wegen mittelstarker Ödeme im rechten Fussknöchel sowie einem subjektiven Kältegefühl in den Füssen in die Behandlung ging. Sie wünschte zur Behandlung des Ödems ein natürliches Produkt und erhielt deshalb 3 × 2 Tabletten/Tag Padma 28. Das Kältegefühl in den Füssen verschwand innerhalb einiger Tage, und schon innerhalb von weniger als 2 Wochen verbesserte sich das Ödem von mittelstark auf schwach. In den nächsten 4 Monaten nahm die Patientin das Präparat nur noch unregelmässig ein. Prompt traten die Beschwerden wieder in mittelstarker Intensität auf. Eine erneute, konsequente Einnahme von 3 × 2 Tabletten brachte die Ödeme innerhalb von 2 Wochen zum Verschwinden. Die Einnahme wurde präventiv weitergeführt; die Ödeme traten nicht mehr auf.Dieser Fallbericht stammt aus einer Allgemeinpraxis in Näfels [4]. Hier handelte es sich um einen 68-jährigen Patienten mit einer diagnostizierten Polyneuropathie (PNP). Die damit verbundenen Beschwerden bestanden schon seit etwa 30 Jahren und äusserten sich in Form von Gefühllosigkeit der Füsse bis zur Mitte der Unterschenkel, Gehschmerzen in den Unterschenkeln, Kältegefühl in den Füssen sowie einer leichten Obstipation. Der Patient klagte auch über seit 20 Jahren bestehende Einschlafstörungen. Auch dieser Patient äusserte den Wunsch nach einer Alternative zur klassischen Medizin. Deshalb wurde ihm Padma 28 in einer Dosierung von 3 × 2 Kapseln/Tag verschrieben. Aufgrund einer deutlichen Verbesserung der Symptome wurde nach 17 Behandlungswochen auf eine Erhaltungsdosis von 2 × 2 Kapseln/Tag reduziert. Die anfänglich stark ausgeprägte Gefühllosigkeit der Füsse bis zur Mitte der Unterschenkel wurde vom Patienten nach 11 Behandlungswochen noch als mittelstark und nach 21 Wochen nur noch als schwach beschrieben. Das Kältegefühl in den Füssen nahm kontinuierlich ab und war nach 21 Wochen verschwunden. Auch die Gehschmerzen in den Unterschenkeln nahmen kontinuierlich ab und waren nach 21 Wochen nur noch schwach ausgeprägt. Auch die Obstipation war nach 21 Wochen nicht mehr vorhanden. Die Einschlafprobleme waren zu diesem Zeitpunkt nur noch schwach.Die 4 vorgestellten Fallberichte geben Hinweise auf eine Wirksamkeit des tibetischen Vielstoffgemischs Padma 28 bei Diabetes-bedingten Parästhesien, bei venösen Beinbeschwerden sowie bei Polyneuropathie. Die Einnahme von Padma 28 zeigte jeweils eine ausgeprägte Abnahme der Beschwerden. Deshalb würde es sich lohnen, weitere Abklärungen durchzuführen, um die Wirksamkeit bei diesen Indikationen zu bestätigen. Weiterhin könnte sich hieraus eine mögliche Wirksamkeit von Padma 28 beim RLS ergeben, da dieses häufig im Zusammenhang mit den in diesen Fallberichten beschriebenen Beschwerden auftritt. Wegen der sehr guten Verträglichkeit von Padma 28 und dem hohen Nebenwirkungspotenzial der klassischen Medikamente zur Behandlung des RLS könnte sich Padma 28 zur wirkungsvollen Alternative in der Behandlung des RLS anbieten.",

If the parent responds “Yes” to Question 1a and “No” to Question 1b (parent reports past depression but denies current episode), the interviewer should assess suicide risk (Questions 12a–12d) and then skip to the section on Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia). If the parent responds “Yes” to Question 12a, 12b, 12c, or 12d, the interviewer should obtain further details and assess the child's current risk of harm to self or others. It is important to inquire about the specifics of plan, time of occurrence, frequency of such thoughts, details of the attempt, current absence or presence of ideation, and so on, and take appropriate preventative action. Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder requires five “Yes” responses to Questions 4–12. At least one symptom must be depressed or irritable mood or loss of interest in usual activities. Also, the symptoms must occur together nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, and interference in functioning must be evident.",

      "title": "Overtraining from a sports psychiatry perspective",
      "abstract": "Overtraining is characterized by a mismatch between exerted strain and exercise tolerance. Overtraining is generally not sufficiently feared nor is enough attention paid to its prevention. As a result, the first warning signals and symptoms are often either perceived too late or there is a delay in the correct interpretation of signs. This often leads to negative consequences over months, which, in turn, can lead to more frequent injuries as well as Depression. Due to the increasing professionalism and density of competition in competitive sports, overtraining occurs more frequently as athletes are left with a shorter period of time to recover. In order to treat overtraining, it is first necessary to identify the syndrome. Symptoms are often disregarded and trainers and athletes attempt to compensate for poor performance with excessive training. This leads to a vicious cycle with significant reduction of the overall performance of the athlete as a consequence. Psychological parameters can also be signs of non-func-tional overload. Examples include restlessness, irritability, emotional instability, recurring states of fear, emerging indifference or reduced performance motivation. However, disturbed cognitive processes as an impairment of central elements of movement control can also occur. As part of sports psychiatric support, conspicuous psychological parameters can be recorded and contextualised. The Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) is available for systematic recording and corresponding process management. The Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) can be used as an instrument for load, training and competition control to prevent non-functional overload and overtraining. It is also suitable for promoting performance and preventing injuries as well as stabilizing the psychological structure. Key Words: Mental Health Symptoms, Mental Disorders, Injury Prevention, Exercise Intolerance, Synergetic Navigation System (SNS)",

      "title": "Understanding the correlates of manic episode in a woman with insular glioma",
      "abstract": "Sir, Psychiatric manifestations are common in patients with brain tumors and sometimes psychiatric symptoms are the only manifestation in these patients.[1] The common psychiatric manifestations are psychosis, mood symptoms, cognitive symptoms, changes in personality, and changes in eating or sexual behavior.[1] It is often difficult to ascertain the development of psychiatric manifestations with the course of the brain tumor. The interventions done for the treatment of brain tumor may also attribute to development of psychiatric manifestations. We highlight here a case (after obtaining informed consent) of insular glioma, who developed manic symptoms after neurosurgical and radiotherapy intervention. The management issues are also discussed. A 36-year-old female of rural background presented in the outpatient services of psychiatry with the complaints of increased irritability, increased talkativeness, grandiose talks, increased physical activity, increased religiosity and reduced sleep for the past 1 month. The symptoms would persist for most part of the day and due to which she would not be able to perform the daily chores. It was the first episode of psychiatric illness. History revealed that there was 3 episodes of generalized tonic clonic type of seizure around 1 year back. She had consulted in a neurosurgery unit and investigated for seizure. Her magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed left insular high-grade glioma. She had undergone left frontotemporal craniotomy for the same around 8 months back and tumor was removed [Figure 1]. Her postoperative period was uneventful. She was started on phenytoin 300 mg/day after surgery and also completed the course of radiotherapy over a period of 4 months. Neuropsychological assessment (on NIMHANS battery) in the post-operative period revealed mild deficits in sustained attention, delayed recall and verbal fluency. However, her recent and remote memory, visual retention and recognition and performance abilities were intact. There was no history of any other medical illness. Her family history was also uneventful. Premorbidly, she was well adjusted to life. There was no history of any psychoactive substance abuse.Figure 1: Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showing near total excision of left insular glioma (a-c). At the depth of the surgical cavity, the internal capsule is visualized (a and c) which was carefully protected during surgery. Hyperintensity around the surgical cavity may indicate small infiltrating tumor residue or postoperative gliosis (c)Her general physical examination and systemic examination did not reveal any abnormality except gum hypertrophy (adverse effect of phenytoin therapy). Her routine hemogram, liver function test, and kidney function test were within normal limits. She was diagnosed with Mania without psychotic symptoms as per the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems-10 diagnostic criteria for research diagnostic criteria. She was started sodium valproate 750 mg/day, and phenytoin was tapered off and gradually stopped. Her seizure was controlled, and manic symptoms were significantly improved over 3 weeks' time. At the end of 3 months, her symptoms were completely resolved. Among the mood symptoms associated with glioma, depressive features are more common.[2] The presence of brain lesions in an individual cannot be always to the psychiatric manifestations present in the person.[3] In our patient, there are many potential causes (tumor in the left temporal lobe, temporal lobectomy, brain tissue damage due to radiotherapy as well seizure episodes) that might have attributed to the development of psychiatric symptoms. However, none of the events temporally correlated with the onset of psychiatric manifestations. Stress response to all these major medical issues might be attributed to the psychopathology. Evidence suggest that a significant number of patients with glioma experience stress during their hospitalization and thereafter.[4] Stress can have a potential role in the development of psychiatric disorder and seems to be of relevance in our case. A mood episode independent of glioma seems to be a sound explanation in this case. Patient's manic symptoms resolved completely with sodium valproate, which is a potent antiepileptic agent as well as a mood stabilizer. Other antiepileptic agents like– phenytoin, phenobarbitone, topiramate, levetiracetam, lacosamide, zonisamide, and benzodiazepines lack the mood stabilizing the property. Choosing valproate as a medication for seizure prophylaxis, will not only ensure a seizure-free recovery; its mood stabilizing property will also take care of manic symptoms as well as aggression. The clinician needs to be cautious enough in considering the psychiatric diagnosis as well as selection of appropriate medication for its treatment. A multidisciplinary collaborative approach might be more useful in this regards. Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

      "title": "Bilateral Anterior Capsulotomy for the Treatment of Refractory Somatic Symptom Disorder: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is a form of mental illness that causes one or more distressing somatic symptoms leading to a significant disruption to everyday life, characterized by excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to these symptoms. While SSD is characterized by significant discomfort in some parts of the body, these symptoms are not related to any known medical condition and therefore it cannot be diagnosed using any medical instrument examination. Currently available treatments for SSD, including drug therapy and psychotherapy (such as cognitive behavioral therapy), usually improve psychiatric symptoms, but the results are often disappointing. Furthermore, SSD is often comorbid with anxiety and depression (75.1 and 65.7%, respectively). Importantly, interventions targeting the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC; e.g., deep brain stimulation and thermal ablation) can effectively treat various mental disorders, such as refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and eating disorders, suggesting that it may also be effective for treating the depressive symptoms associated with SSD comorbidity. In this report, a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with SSD accompanied with depression and anxiety underwent bilateral anterior capsulotomy. The patient complained of nausea and vomiting, swelling of the hilum of the liver for 14 years, weakness of the limbs for 13 years, and burning pain in the esophagus for 1 year. Psychiatric and neuropsychological assessments were conducted to record the severity of the patients' symptoms and the progression of postoperative symptoms. The patient's somatization, depression, and anxiety symptoms as well as quality of life improved significantly and steadily; thus, anti-depressive and anti-anxiety medication were stopped. However, the patient developed new somatization symptoms, including dizziness, headache, and sternal pain, 10 months after the operation. Therefore, the patient resumed taking flupentixol and melitracen in order to control the new symptoms. This study shows that bilateral anterior capsulotomy appears to be a complementary treatment for refractory SSD with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, postoperative use of anxiolytic and antidepressant medications may be useful for controlling future somatization symptoms.",

      "abstract": "This chapter deals with the diagnosis of mood disorders. The adoption of a lumping strategy for mood disorders, particularly for classifying depressive disorders, reflects the perspective of depression as a unitary construct that represents a final common pathway derived from a variety of etiological and pathophysiological sources, which accounts for the shared clinical features seen in the heterogeneous groups of depressive disorders. A diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE) is made by recognizing the characteristic syndrome of symptoms that cluster together during the same period of time. The hallmark of manic and hypomanic episodes is a discrete period of abnormally elevated, euphoric, expansive, or irritable mood that persists for at least a week in the case of mania or at least 4 days in the case of hypomania. Major depressive disorder is characterized by one or more major depressive episodes.",

      "abstract": "Psychische stoornissen zijn verantwoordelijk voor ruim\n 23% van de (directe) kosten van de gezondheidszorg (inclusief zorg voor\n verstandelijke handicap en dementie). Voor een beter onderbouwde preventie\n binnen het geestelijk volksgezondheidsbeleid is meer kennis nodig over de\n determinanten van psychische stoornissen en over de mogelijkheden om die\n determinanten te beinvloeden. Deze state-of-the-art geeft aan dat\n persoonlijkheidskenmerken als (overmatige) geremdheid, neuroticisme,\n impulsiviteit en cognitieve en sociaal-communicatieve beperkingen meerdere\n psychische stoornissen beinvloeden. Dit geldt ook voor traumatische\n ervaringen in de jeugd, een lage SES, sterke verstedelijking en snelle\n sociale veranderingen. Theoretisch gezien valt de meeste gezondheidswinst\n op het terrein van de psychische (on)gezondheid dan ook te behalen door\n beinvloeding van (het leren omgaan met) deze zogenaamde generieke\n determinanten. Ten aanzien van de effecten van interventies op\n determinanten van de psychische gezondheid zijn nog geen definitieve\n conclusies mogelijk. Het lijkt echter aannemelijk dat met name die\n interventies veelbelovend zijn die op meerdere determinanten tegelijk\n aangrijpen. Dit sluit aan bij het gegeven dat interacties tussen\n determinanten een belangrijke rol spelen in de etiologie van stoornissen. Secundaire preventie van depressie bij ouderen en preventie van druggebruik\n via schoolprogramma's blijken voldoende doeltreffend om over te gaan tot\n landelijke implementatie. Interventies gericht op familieleden van\n psychiatrische patienten lijken doeltreffend in het voorkomen van\n overbelasting, stress en angst. Een intensivering van het onderzoek naar\n determinanten van psychische stoornissen is een noodzakelijke voorwaarde om\n een flinke stap vooruit te maken ten aanzien van de mogelijkheden voor\n preventie. Daarnaast is het van belang strategieen voor landelijke\n implementatie van doeltreffende programma's te ontwikkelen en onderzoek op\n dit terrein te stimuleren.",

      "abstract": "Neurologische Patienten und Angstpatienten weisen deutliche storungsspezifische\r\nUnterschiede innerhalb ihres Besserungsverlaufes auf.\r\nZusammenfassend lasst sich sagen, dass sich neurologische Patienten hinsichtlich\r\nihrer neurologischen Symptomatik nur wenig besserten, jedoch die Depressivitat\r\nsowie der Allgemeinzustand nach sechs Wochen stationarer Verhaltenstherapie eine\r\ndeutliche Verbesserung aufwiesen.\r\nDabei besserte sich die Depressivitat im Vergleich zu den Angstpatienten weder\r\nlangsamer noch geringer. Am Ende des Aufenthaltes zeigten die neurologischen\r\nPatienten sogar eine signifikant geringer ausgepragte depressive Symptomatik. Der\r\nGesamteindruck der neurologischen Patienten scheint mehr durch die komorbiden\r\nStorungen als durch Anderungen der neurologischen Symptomatik beeinflusst zu\r\nwerden, wohingegen das allgemeine Storungsbild der Angstpatienten durch die\r\nAngstreduktion bestimmt zu werden scheint.\r\nDie Depressivitat der neurologischen Patienten erscheint nicht organisch bedingt,\r\nsondern tritt vielmehr als Form einer Anpassungsstorung auf; als ein Ausdruck von\r\nmangelnden Bewaltigungsstrategien bzw. von Hilflosigkeit der neurologischen\r\nErkrankung gegenuber.\r\nIn beiden Patientengruppen zeigen sich die komorbiden Storungen Alexithymie und\r\nStress.\r\nBei den neurologischen Patienten deutet die Alexithymie moglicherweise auf einen\r\ngrundlegenden Mangel an emotionaler Kompetenz hin, eine wichtige Vorraussetzung\r\nfur die eigene Krankheitsbewaltigung. Die chronischen Stressbelastungen scheinen\r\nweniger direkt durch die neurologische Erkrankung bedingt, sondern vielmehr durch\r\nden - hilflosen - Umgang mit der Symptomatik und der neuen Lebenssituation.\r\nErlernen von Bewaltigungsstrategien, insbesondere mit dem Ziel eines adaquaten\r\nKrankheitsumgangs, konnte somit nicht nur einen bestimmenden Faktor fur die\r\nAbnahme der Alexithymie darstellen, sondern auch fur die Depressivitat und die\r\nStressbelastung.\r\nFur das stationare Behandlungskonzept scheint die Therapie der komorbiden\r\nStorungen sowie die Krankheitsbewaltigung eine zentrale Rolle in der Behandlung von neurologischen Patienten zu spielen. Ob jedoch eine Verbesserung der\r\nkomorbiden Storungen langfristig einen Einfluss auf den Verlauf der neurologischen\r\nSymptomatik hat, mussten Untersuchungen innerhalb eines langeren Zeitraumes\r\nklaren. Fur eine Veranderung der neurologischen Symptomatik ist der von uns\r\nbeobachtete Zeitraum moglicherweise zu kurz gewesen.\r\nDie Ergebnisse unserer Studie erlauben die Diskussion, dass die Angst der\r\nAngstpatienten Ausdruck einer zugrunde liegenden Depression und moglicherweise\r\nauch Ausdruck einer bestehenden Alexithymie und chronischen Stressbelastung sein\r\nkonnte. Der Gesamteindruck von Angstpatienten wird unserer Beobachtung nach\r\nhauptsachlich durch die Angstsymptomatik bestimmt. Den vorhandenen komorbiden\r\nStorungen und deren notwendige Behandlung wurde damit eine zu geringe\r\nBedeutung beigemessen werden. Die Folge ware eine Persistenz der komorbiden\r\nStorungen als Ausdruck weiterhin bestehender struktureller und Verhaltensdefizite.\r\nDies konnte jedoch den Boden fur eine wiederkehrende Angstsymptomatik bilden\r\nund somit die vielfach beobachtete Chronizitat von Angststorungen erklaren. Weitere\r\nUntersuchungen uber einen langeren Beobachtungszeitraum sind zur Klarung dieser\r\nFrage notig.\r\nBeide komorbiden Storungen, Alexithymie und chronische Stressbelastung haben\r\nsich im Verlauf jedoch nicht als eindeutige Moderatorvariablen identifizieren lassen.\r\nDie von uns vermuteten Einflusse geben Anlass zu weiteren Untersuchungen.\r\nUnsere Ergebnisse zeigen in beiden Gruppen einen unterschiedlichen Ruckgang der\r\nDepressivitat, gleichzeitig mit einer unterschiedlichen Besserung der\r\nGrunderkrankung bei gleicher Einschatzung des Entlassungszustandes. Die Wahl der\r\nDepressivitat als Indikatorvariable fur den Besserungsverlauf lasst sich vor diesem\r\nHintergrund kritisch diskutieren, ebenso die Frage nach einer Definition des\r\nBesserungsverlaufes.\r\nZusammenfassend zeigen die Ergebnisse unserer Studie, dass sich der\r\nstorungsspezifische Besserungsverlauf von Angst- und neurologischen Erkrankungen\r\nzwar unterscheidet; die Unterschiede aber genau entgegen der Hypothese ausgefallen\r\nsind.",

      "title": "Delayed onset and resolution of pain: Some observations and implications",
      "abstract": "Occasionally, pain after disease or trauma develops only after a prolonged interval. Examples include late-onset pains which first occur months or years following a stroke, spinal cord lesion or amputation of a limb; a previously experienced pain that is recalled years later; and latent pain triggered for the first time by a further insult in the same area. Late-onset pains may develop gradually or suddenly, and may be brief or long standing. Pains which develop after an innocuous insult may be associated with slowly evolving sensory changes. However, even long-standing pains, particularly those of nociceptive origin, may resolve sometimes after many years. Resolution, which again can occur gradually or suddenly, may be spontaneous or follow development of another disorder or after therapeutic intervention. The duration of this pain relief can range from minutes to an indefinite period. These clinical phenomena, and the mechanisms, including genetic factors, subserving them, have been little studied. It is postulated that mechanisms implicated in acute pain may not be the same as those that subserve pain that develops after a long interval. Those late-onset pains which develop slowly after innocuous lesions may be associated with a variety of slow anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes. In late-onset pains that follow a painful insult, however, memory of the former pain and threshold triggering factors may be particularly important. Further studies of these neglected conditions may lead to understanding of as yet unknown processes subserving pain and to novel approaches to treatment.",

ASD can be diagnosed if a person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which the person experiences feelings of dissociation, reexperiences symptoms, shows marked avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, and experiences hyperarousal. For the diagnosis of ASD to be given, the distress must be present for a minimum of two days and a maximum of four weeks and must occur within four weeks of the traumatic event. Other common reactions to extreme stressors include physical complaints, such as chronic pain, fatigue, stomach pains, breathing problems, and headaches, and self-destructive or impulsive behavior, such as alcohol or drug abuse, high-risk sexual behavior, suicidal impulses, and fast or reckless driving.",

      "title": "Buspirone Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury in a Child Who Is Highly Sensitive to Adverse Effects of Psychotropic Medications",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury can produce various neuropsychiatric impairments and a high susceptibility to adverse effects of psychotropic medications. A 6-year-old boy developed symptoms of ADHD after head trauma at age 30 months. Three different psychostimulants, three tricyclic antidepressants, clonidine, bupropion, fluoxetine, and propranolol were either ineffective or produced adverse effects. Side effects mainly consisted of organic mood syndrome (despite the lack of apparent genetic or organic mood disorder), sympathomimetic intoxication, and sympathomimetic hallucinosis. Buspirone (10 mg q.i.d.) produced significant improvement in impulsivity and hyperactivity, but not in attention deficits. Methamphetamine (5 mg every morning), added to the buspirone, was effective in treating the remaining attentional symptoms. These treatments were readily tolerated, and the child has remained stable for 2 years on buspirone and methamphetamine. The symptoms of mood disorder were present only during stimulant or antidepressant treatment, and therefore the diagnosis of organic mood disorder did not apply. Apart from medication side effects, the child appeared to have an \"organically-based pharmacological vulnerability to mood disorder\" and postinjury ADHD (although comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions might have contributed to the complex clinical picture). This single case study was uncontrolled, did not involve drug withdrawal design, and used clinical observations rather than standardized measures. Further study is needed before buspirone can be viewed as safe or effective for treating TBI, but buspirone may be an attractive alternative for managing certain behavioral problems following brain injury, especially in patients sensitive to adverse effects of psychotropic medications.",

      "abstract": "The word depression is being used to describe both a symptom and an illness.The symptom is the experience of gloom, despondency, sadness, grief; the feeling of being run down, dispirited, miserable, melancholic, in the dumps, or of being low.The richness of our language in synonyms for depression may be taken as an indication of its frequency.It is an emotional experience, though sometimes it is described as an empti- ness or flatness, seemingly a loss rather than a lowering of affect.Depression, like anxiety, is a universal experience, and we regard it as abnormal only if it appears without reason or if it seems excessive in its degree or duration in relation to the pro- vocation.Not surprisingly such a common feeling may be associated with any psychiatric syndrome; the depressive dis- orders are those in which the depressed affect appears to be the primary phenomenon or at any rate one of the more prominent of the clinical features.Broadly there are two depressive entities-endogenous depres- sion, which is a variant of manic-depressive illness, and neurotic depression.In practice the differentiation of these two condi- tions is often difficult, but this is not surprising when we recall that any primary psychiatric disturbance may be associated with secondary or reactive features, and of these depression is one of the more common.A convenient though over-simplified view that attempts to quantify this relationship suggests that in any individual case we can regard the patient a. showing say-to give an example-40% endogenous and 60% reactive or neurotic depression.If so, one should not forget that irre- spective of the magnitude of the figures it is the endogenous component that is important, for the remainder is a reaction to it.Successful treatment of the endogenous component is likely to lead to total recovery, whereas treatment directed only at the reactive component can hardly be more than partly successful.The term \" atypical depression \" has been applied to some of these cases.It is only in the last 10 or 15 years we have come to appre- ciate how common is depressive illness.Watts' estimated that in general practice one could expect that of every 1,000 patients 12 would present as revw cases each year.Older figures, largely hospital derived and therefore making little allowance for milder cases, suggest that the incidence of endogenous depression alone is 1% in males and 2% in females.It would be unwise to suggest that depressive illness has become more common in the last 10 years ; the much larger number of cases seen reflects the fact that we have learned to recognize its milder forms.

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings and in primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many of those who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms which are seen in all anxiety disorders, and diagnosis rests on the identification of the particular anxiety disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or undergoing individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, and for this reason it is helpful to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence-base for each anxiety disorder.",

All underwent neuropsychological evaluation, brain imaging, and ancillary investigations to establish a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. <b>Results:</b> The six cases all had a progressive dementia syndrome with prominent amnesia, often accompanied by classic cortical features including dysphasia, dysgraphia, or dyslexia. Mood disturbance was ubiquitous and in three patients there was a long history of preceding severe depression. All six developed characteristic physical signs on follow up, with marked disabilities. A review of 17 previously reported cases highlighted the prominence of memory impairment and depression in the early stages. <b>Conclusions:</b> On clinical, pathological, and radiological grounds, the neuropsychiatric presentation of multiple sclerosis may represent a clinicopathological entity of \"cortical multiple sclerosis.\" Failure to recognise this will delay diagnosis and may expose patients to potentially dangerous and invasive investigation. Because the neuropsychiatric features of cortical multiple sclerosis are a major cause of handicap, their early recognition may be particularly important in view of emerging treatments.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of essential fatty acid, B vitamin, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation for managing stress in women: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this systematic review is to identify the effectiveness of essential fatty acids (EFAs), B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc, consumed as supplements to the daily diet, for managing stress in women. Background The definition of stress has changed in the last few decades. It is no longer seen as only a natural physiological response to a life-threatening event, but also as a specific psychological experience.1 Used colloquially, it is understood to be a negative state of mind, and can broadly be defined as the fear of not being able to cope with a situation that one faces.2 “Time pressure” is another aspect related to the perception of stress today, and relates to the feeling that there is not enough time to accomplish tasks.3 Continuously feeling unable to cope, coupled with ongoing time constraints in performing required tasks, may lead to chronic stress. Chronic stress has been linked to two specific mental health disorders, namely, severe anxiety and depression, due to stress hormone release impacting a number of brain regions, including those responsible for maintaining emotional equilibrium.2,4 Therefore, although stress is not a mental health disorder, in and of itself, when experienced chronically, it may lead to anxiety disorders and depression, which are classified as mental health disorders.2,5 Although the rate at which men and women suffer from mental health disorders is similar, there are marked gender differences in the overall pattern of their mental illness.6,7 Compared to men, women are 50% more susceptible to depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobias and insomnia, hypothesized to be as a result of internalizing their feelings and emotions.2,7,8 Men are more susceptible to externalizing their feelings and emotions, which result in alcoholism, aggression, and substance abuse.2,7,8 Although there are a number of theories explaining why this gender disparity exists, such as neurobiological and neurochemical gender differences, sex steroids and psychosocial stressors, there is as yet no consensus.8,9 Even though the reproductive cycle is considered to be an important part of the physiological explanation for this gender disparity, psychosocial factors are seen to play an increasingly important role.9,10 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to poverty, socioeconomic disadvantages, subordinate social rank and gender based violence and discrimination are other societal factors to take into account when assessing the disparity between the rates of depression experienced by women and men.6 The variety of social roles that women play in today's complex society, such as being wives, mothers, workers and, caretakers of elderly parents, and the growing strata of single-mothers, may be additional risk factors that increase feelings of psychological distress, such as anxiety, fear, confusion and depression, as well as mood-swings.2,8 In addition, some research suggests that women spend more time performing household tasks, and perform a wider range of them than men do, placing additional demands on their time.11,12 The juggling of these various roles, coupled with ongoing domestic tasks, expose women to multiple stressors which can lead to the experience of chronic stress. Chronic stress has been linked to the development of depression, with a significant increase in rates of depression being observed when anxiety disorders are present too.2,7 When stress is experienced, cortisol is one of a number of hormones produced, with high levels of circulating cortisol associated with high levels of stress.2,13 The discovery that depression is also linked to high circulating levels of cortisol supports the findings of psychological research on stress and depression often co-existing.2,7 Depression has been equated to an extreme reaction to chronic stress, indicating that chronic stress could be a catalyst for the development of depression.2 However, more research has been conducted on gender differences in depression than on anxiety disorders.2 The role that gender plays in the development of depression in the presence of anxiety is therefore not well understood. The 1996 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study predicted that clinical or unipolar depression would be the second most significant cause of disability burden in the world by 2020.14 The 2004 updated GBD Study indicates that depression is the leading cause of disease burden for women in low, middle and high-income countries.15 In contrast, it ranked fourth among the 15 leading causes in 1990, showing an adverse, steady increase.14 Addressing ongoing stress may serve to prevent the development of depression in vulnerable women. High blood pressure (hypertension) may also be an indicator of increased stress levels.3 When associated with stress, blood pressure increases due to raised heart muscle activity, the narrowing of blood vessels (vasoconstriction), and increased blood flow to the heart and muscles, in anticipation of imminent physical danger. During the stress response, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is activated, which stimulates adrenal activity, consequently increasing blood pressure too.13 Although there are other physiological symptoms of stress, such as reduced immunity, gastrointestinal challenges, changes in weight and increased fatigue, measuring blood pressure may be a simple, quick and efficient way to confirm the presence of stress.3,13 As mentioned above, circulating cortisol levels, measured in either blood or saliva, also provide a good indication of stress levels.2,3,13 The body and brain are reliant on optimal nutrient supply for structure and function.16,17 Various key nutrients are critical for cognitive functioning, hormone and neurotransmitter synthesis, and stress response regulation. Stress inducing thoughts or experiences stimulate a biochemical cascade that activates the flight-or-flight response, via the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal (HPA) axis.1,2,18 Many of the B vitamins, as well as vitamin C, magnesium and zinc are used to regulate the stress response and synthesize hormones necessary for increased physical activity, such as adrenaline and cortisol.1 In contrast, the synthesis of the calming neurotransmitter serotonin also requires many of the same nutrients.17 As the stress response is a survival mechanism, it takes precedence over the synthesis of hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate mood, induce calm and precede sleep. Therefore, being exposed to chronic stress has the potential to deplete the body and brain of these nutrients, and reduce the capacity to synthesize other important hormones and neurotransmitters.1 Likewise, the ability to return to homeostasis after experiencing stress may be severely compromised when a deficiency in these nutrients exists.1 A downward spiral of increased stress levels and depression may result, with women being more susceptible to this trend because of their exposure to multiple stressors. Although essential fatty acids (EFAs) are not directly involved in the stress regulation process, they are critically important nutrients required for optimal cellular functioning.19 The presence of EFAs in cell membranes improves oxygen and nutrient assimilation to facilitate cellular energy production, and improves membrane flexibility and permeability, which are important aspects of cellular, and specifically, neuronal functioning.19 There are two classes of EFAs, omega 3 and omega 6, which have to be supplied by the diet because humans lack the enzymes to synthesize them.19 The brain, comprising 60% fat at dry weight, is particularly susceptible to a lack of EFAs due to the variety of critical roles they play in neuronal and synaptic membrane structure and function. It is estimated that approximately 20% of the 60% is made up of EFAs.19 Essential fatty acids are also precursors to eicosanoids, which play important roles in a variety of neural activities.19 Over the last five or six decades the consumption of omega 3 has been declining in the general population due to a variety of reasons, leading to a general deficiency in this critically important nutrient.20,21 Supplementing with the following key nutrients, which are vital for the synthesis of hormones linked to the stress response and its regulation, may be useful when ongoing stress is present: Essential fatty acids are involved in both neuronal membrane structure and neurotransmitter release.19 A deficiency in these important nutrients is linked to cognitive functioning deficits, which may affect the ability to cope with stress effectively.19,22 Specific B vitamins are used as co-factors during the stress response to synthesize adrenaline, and they are also used to synthesize neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine.1,16 B vitamins are also used during glucose metabolism in the brain.15 The role they play in cognitive functioning is therefore critical, and a deficiency may affect the ability to cope with stress effectively.17 Vitamin C has an important antioxidant role to play in the brain, in addition to being a co-factor in adrenalin and neurotransmitter synthesis. The brain and adrenal glands are the organs with the highest concentration of this critically important nutrient.16,23 A lack of this vitamin will therefore affect cognitive functioning, and may impact on the ability to cope effectively with stress.17 The micronutrient magnesium is involved in neuronal cell metabolism and is an important co-factor in adrenalin and neurotransmitter synthesis.1,24 Magnesium deficiency will therefore influence cognitive functioning, and may impact on the ability to cope with stress effectively.25 The micronutrient zinc is involved in neuronal cell structure and metabolism, and plays an important role as a co-factor in adrenalin and neurotransmitter synthesis.26,27 Zinc deficiency will therefore influence cognitive functioning, and may impact on the ability to cope effectively with stress.26 In addition, B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc are co-factors in converting plant based omega 3 EFAs to the highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) metabolites.19 A lack of these metabolites in brain tissue is associated with a variety of mental health challenges.19 A lack of these EFAs may therefore impact on the ability to cope with stress effectively.19 Research has clearly shown that these nutrients are required for hormone and neurotransmitter synthesis.1,17,19,24,26 During ongoing stress these nutrients become depleted because they are used on an ongoing basis to synthesize stress hormones, which takes precedence over other important physiological functions also requiring these nutrients.1,17,28 Furthermore, the absorption of some of these nutrients is also hampered during ongoing stress, and increased excretion of others occurs.1 A number of studies have examined the role that some of these nutrients play in mental health, generally, either in various combinations or alone.28–34 There is however a lack of evidence to support the use of nutrient supplementation for the management of stress, even though supplementation to ameliorate the symptoms of stress is widespread.35 The aim of this systematic review is therefore to investigate whether EFAs, B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc are capable of reducing levels of stress experienced by women. The review author has conducted a preliminary search of the JBI COnNECT+ database, Embase, Prospero, CINAHL and MEDLINE via PubMed databases, using the keywords below, and no prior or progressing systematic reviews addressing the effectiveness of EFAs, B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc on stress levels in women have been found. Inclusion criteria Types of participants The systematic review will consider studies that include all women over the age of 18 years. Studies that include pregnant women will also be considered. Studies that have included both genders will be considered where it is possible to extract data for female participants. Women taking prescription medication for anxiety or depression will be excluded, as will hospitalized women or women suffering from eating disorders. Types of intervention(s) This review will consider studies that evaluate the effectiveness of supplementation with EFAs, specifically Omega-3; B Vitamins, specifically vitamin B3, B5, B6, B9 (folic acid) and B12; Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc at any dose/frequency for managing stress or anxiety being experienced by women. Supplements delivered in any oral form, including capsules, tablets, caplets, chewables, powders and liquids, at any dosage and for a duration of 14 days or longer will be considered. The supplementation of these nutrients will be investigated, whether used individually or in any combination. This review will not consider interventions that have used a combination of herbal and EFA, B vitamin, vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation, either alone with the herbal supplement, or in combination with the herbal supplement. Types of comparators Essential fatty acid, B vitamin, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation, either alone, or combined, will be compared with either no intervention or placebo. This review will include studies that compare the named nutrients to each other, either in individual combinations or in a variety of combinations.

      "title": "The effectiveness of essential fatty acid, B vitamin, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation for managing stress in women: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this systematic review is to identify the effectiveness of essential fatty acids (EFAs), B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc, consumed as supplements to the daily diet, for managing stress in women. Background The definition of stress has changed in the last few decades. It is no longer seen as only a natural physiological response to a life-threatening event, but also as a specific psychological experience.1 Used colloquially, it is understood to be a negative state of mind, and can broadly be defined as the fear of not being able to cope with a situation that one faces.2 “Time pressure” is another aspect related to the perception of stress today, and relates to the feeling that there is not enough time to accomplish tasks.3 Continuously feeling unable to cope, coupled with ongoing time constraints in performing required tasks, may lead to chronic stress. Chronic stress has been linked to two specific mental health disorders, namely, severe anxiety and depression, due to stress hormone release impacting a number of brain regions, including those responsible for maintaining emotional equilibrium.2,4 Therefore, although stress is not a mental health disorder, in and of itself, when experienced chronically, it may lead to anxiety disorders and depression, which are classified as mental health disorders.2,5 Although the rate at which men and women suffer from mental health disorders is similar, there are marked gender differences in the overall pattern of their mental illness.6,7 Compared to men, women are 50% more susceptible to depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobias and insomnia, hypothesized to be as a result of internalizing their feelings and emotions.2,7,8 Men are more susceptible to externalizing their feelings and emotions, which result in alcoholism, aggression, and substance abuse.2,7,8 Although there are a number of theories explaining why this gender disparity exists, such as neurobiological and neurochemical gender differences, sex steroids and psychosocial stressors, there is as yet no consensus.8,9 Even though the reproductive cycle is considered to be an important part of the physiological explanation for this gender disparity, psychosocial factors are seen to play an increasingly important role.9,10 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to poverty, socioeconomic disadvantages, subordinate social rank and gender based violence and discrimination are other societal factors to take into account when assessing the disparity between the rates of depression experienced by women and men.6 The variety of social roles that women play in today's complex society, such as being wives, mothers, workers and, caretakers of elderly parents, and the growing strata of single-mothers, may be additional risk factors that increase feelings of psychological distress, such as anxiety, fear, confusion and depression, as well as mood-swings.2,8 In addition, some research suggests that women spend more time performing household tasks, and perform a wider range of them than men do, placing additional demands on their time.11,12 The juggling of these various roles, coupled with ongoing domestic tasks, expose women to multiple stressors which can lead to the experience of chronic stress. Chronic stress has been linked to the development of depression, with a significant increase in rates of depression being observed when anxiety disorders are present too.2,7 When stress is experienced, cortisol is one of a number of hormones produced, with high levels of circulating cortisol associated with high levels of stress.2,13 The discovery that depression is also linked to high circulating levels of cortisol supports the findings of psychological research on stress and depression often co-existing.2,7 Depression has been equated to an extreme reaction to chronic stress, indicating that chronic stress could be a catalyst for the development of depression.2 However, more research has been conducted on gender differences in depression than on anxiety disorders.2 The role that gender plays in the development of depression in the presence of anxiety is therefore not well understood. The 1996 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study predicted that clinical or unipolar depression would be the second most significant cause of disability burden in the world by 2020.14 The 2004 updated GBD Study indicates that depression is the leading cause of disease burden for women in low, middle and high-income countries.15 In contrast, it ranked fourth among the 15 leading causes in 1990, showing an adverse, steady increase.14 Addressing ongoing stress may serve to prevent the development of depression in vulnerable women. High blood pressure (hypertension) may also be an indicator of increased stress levels.3 When associated with stress, blood pressure increases due to raised heart muscle activity, the narrowing of blood vessels (vasoconstriction), and increased blood flow to the heart and muscles, in anticipation of imminent physical danger. During the stress response, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is activated, which stimulates adrenal activity, consequently increasing blood pressure too.13 Although there are other physiological symptoms of stress, such as reduced immunity, gastrointestinal challenges, changes in weight and increased fatigue, measuring blood pressure may be a simple, quick and efficient way to confirm the presence of stress.3,13 As mentioned above, circulating cortisol levels, measured in either blood or saliva, also provide a good indication of stress levels.2,3,13 The body and brain are reliant on optimal nutrient supply for structure and function.16,17 Various key nutrients are critical for cognitive functioning, hormone and neurotransmitter synthesis, and stress response regulation. Stress inducing thoughts or experiences stimulate a biochemical cascade that activates the flight-or-flight response, via the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal (HPA) axis.1,2,18 Many of the B vitamins, as well as vitamin C, magnesium and zinc are used to regulate the stress response and synthesize hormones necessary for increased physical activity, such as adrenaline and cortisol.1 In contrast, the synthesis of the calming neurotransmitter serotonin also requires many of the same nutrients.17 As the stress response is a survival mechanism, it takes precedence over the synthesis of hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate mood, induce calm and precede sleep. Therefore, being exposed to chronic stress has the potential to deplete the body and brain of these nutrients, and reduce the capacity to synthesize other important hormones and neurotransmitters.1 Likewise, the ability to return to homeostasis after experiencing stress may be severely compromised when a deficiency in these nutrients exists.1 A downward spiral of increased stress levels and depression may result, with women being more susceptible to this trend because of their exposure to multiple stressors. Although essential fatty acids (EFAs) are not directly involved in the stress regulation process, they are critically important nutrients required for optimal cellular functioning.19 The presence of EFAs in cell membranes improves oxygen and nutrient assimilation to facilitate cellular energy production, and improves membrane flexibility and permeability, which are important aspects of cellular, and specifically, neuronal functioning.19 There are two classes of EFAs, omega 3 and omega 6, which have to be supplied by the diet because humans lack the enzymes to synthesize them.19 The brain, comprising 60% fat at dry weight, is particularly susceptible to a lack of EFAs due to the variety of critical roles they play in neuronal and synaptic membrane structure and function.

The brain and adrenal glands are the organs with the highest concentration of this critically important nutrient.16,23 A lack of this vitamin will therefore affect cognitive functioning, and may impact on the ability to cope effectively with stress.17 The micronutrient magnesium is involved in neuronal cell metabolism and is an important co-factor in adrenalin and neurotransmitter synthesis.1,24 Magnesium deficiency will therefore influence cognitive functioning, and may impact on the ability to cope with stress effectively.25 The micronutrient zinc is involved in neuronal cell structure and metabolism, and plays an important role as a co-factor in adrenalin and neurotransmitter synthesis.26,27 Zinc deficiency will therefore influence cognitive functioning, and may impact on the ability to cope effectively with stress.26 In addition, B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc are co-factors in converting plant based omega 3 EFAs to the highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) metabolites.19 A lack of these metabolites in brain tissue is associated with a variety of mental health challenges.19 A lack of these EFAs may therefore impact on the ability to cope with stress effectively.19 Research has clearly shown that these nutrients are required for hormone and neurotransmitter synthesis.1,17,19,24,26 During ongoing stress these nutrients become depleted because they are used on an ongoing basis to synthesize stress hormones, which takes precedence over other important physiological functions also requiring these nutrients.1,17,28 Furthermore, the absorption of some of these nutrients is also hampered during ongoing stress, and increased excretion of others occurs.1 A number of studies have examined the role that some of these nutrients play in mental health, generally, either in various combinations or alone.28–34 There is however a lack of evidence to support the use of nutrient supplementation for the management of stress, even though supplementation to ameliorate the symptoms of stress is widespread.35 The aim of this systematic review is therefore to investigate whether EFAs, B vitamins, Vitamin C, magnesium and zinc are capable of reducing levels of stress experienced by women.

Studies on job stress have revealed that lately this problem or condition has greatly affected people who work as workers; since the consequences of suffering stress from work are sufficient, they are also serious and in some cases difficult to manage. Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor. Be very careful, because if it can be avoided they can cause fatal damage to humans or even cause death.",

In other instances, especially when the discharges are more atypical, the psychic disturbances may take on the character of either a simple worsening of behavior or of a confusional state with agitation and delirium, or of a stuporous state. The temporal lobe statuses, which are much more rare, manifest themselves either as a succession of psychomotor attacks, or as protracted confusional or confusooneiric episodes. An EEG makes it possible, at any rate, to differentiate between the petit mal statuses and the temporal lobe statuses.

      "title": "People presenting with physical disorder",
      "abstract": "All healthcare professionals dealing primarily with physical disorder need a working knowledge of relevant psychological factors and psychiatric dis­orders. Despite the geographical and, often, cul­tural separation of most ‘general’ (i.e. physical) and psychiatric hospitals, there are close links (1) be­tween physical and psychological disorders, and (2) between physical and psychological factors in the aetiology, presentation, and management of all illness. This chapter aims to stimulate you to think about these issues in primary care and in the general hospital, and to equip you with the know­ledge required to think about them in an integrated, biopsychosocial way. The links between physical and psychological fac­tors are multiple. They include: … ● psychiatric and physical disorders occurring together by chance— as they are both common; ● psychiatric disorders causing physical symptoms— for example, depression is associated with low physical energy (anergia), amenorrhoea, and constipation; ● psychiatric disorder adversely affecting the outcome of physical disorder— for example, a depressive disorder might impair self- management of diabetes mellitus, because low motivation is a common symptom of depression, and may reduce adherence to self- monitoring of glucose; ● psychological factors increasing disability associated with physical disorder— for example, if a patient recovering from a myocardial infarction believes that it has led to a permanent reduction in their cardiac function, they are less likely to return to work, to take regular exercise, and to have a normal sex life; ● untreated psychological problems leading to the inappropriate use of medical resources and to poor compliance with medical advice— for example, people with panic disorder are more likely to attend emergency departments with acute ‘cardiac’ symptoms; ● physical symptoms and disorders having psychological consequences, which include psychiatric disorder— for example, hypothyroidism and cerebrovascular disease may lead to depression; ● physical disorder exacerbating unrelated psychiatric symptoms— for example, a viral infection could delay recovery from a depressive disorder, by impairing the person’s usual activities, at work and at home, which would otherwise provide therapeutic distraction and stimulation.",

      "abstract": "Daily physiological processes, excessive physical fatigue, sub-clinical viral infections and certain environmental situations can all cause some kind of physical pain or distress in 75% of adults in a typical week. When the individual refuses to accept medical opinion and attributes the pain to a physical illness and persistently seeks diagnosis and treatment, then there is a possibility of an unexplained somatic problem. Depression, anxiety or even a personality disorder may be causative factors. The lack of studies of this type of disorder in the prison environment makes it difficult to fully evaluate the importance of this phenomenon for primary health care consultation in prison, despite the fact that the number of presented unexplained somatic complaints may well be the same as in the community (around 15%). Management of this type of patient is always difficult, complex and emotionally demanding for the health care professional.",

      "abstract": "Brief everyday stressors can provoke cardiovascular, hormonal, and immune changes, and the magnitude and duration of these responses can vary considerably. Acute responses to daily stressors can differ widely among individuals experiencing the same stressor, and these physiological responses may not align with stress appraisals. This review highlights individual and dyadic factors that may heighten and prolong stress reactivity, along with their implications for health. We discuss depression, rumination, early life adversity, and social evaluation as individual-level factors and interpersonal stress processes and relationship quality as dyadic-level factors that may influence physiological stress responses. Heightened and prolonged stress reactivity can provide a gateway to the physiological dysregulation that underlies depression and chronic disease, which themselves alter stress reactivity—a vicious cycle. Interventions that may dampen physiological stress reactivity include yoga, meditation, health behaviors (diet, exercise, and sleep), and cognitive behavior therapy.",

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

Usually stress creates delays (because the body needs to stop what it was doing at the moment and mobilize for response to the stressor). These delays destroy the harmony of biorhythms [1], which means stress disturbs the body regulating mechanisms. This results in a chronic disease of the genetically inherited weak organ or cancer. ‘Chronic’ means ‘slow’. It takes a lot of stress accumulation to shift the regulating mechanism out of balance. When the Humoral Immune System (HIS) is weak, stress results in chronic disease.",

      "title": "Specific Phobia vs Panic Disorder in Children: A Unique Case Report and Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Specific phobia is defined as marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear and anxiety, is actively avoided, or endured with intense fear or anxiety that is out proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object/situation and to the sociocultural context. These symptoms are persistent and last for at least six months. The prevalence of specific and social phobia in children and adolescents is 2.9 and 0.3%. Panic disorder is defined as recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and is accompanied by at least 4/13 symptoms. One of these panic attacks must be followed by at least one month of constant worry about additional panic attacks and their consequences. There is a significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks. Such disturbances are not attributable to physiological effects of other substances, medical conditions, or other mental disorders. The prevalence of panic disorders is 5 – 15 percent in adolescents and 5 percent in children.\r\n\r\nCase Presentation: We present a case of a 3-year old male with panic attacks for over one year which started after an incident of smoke detector alarm followed by three more episodes of panic attacks at the daycare center. The recent episode was 4 weeks ago. After the last incident, the patient stopped eating and refused food which worsened over the past 2 weeks. The patient was evaluated and diagnosed with panic disorder, specific phobia, eating disorder, and referred to outpatient Psychologist.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n• Learn about anxiety disorders in children.\r\n\r\n• Management options for anxiety in children.\r\n\r\n• Etiopathogenesis of anxiety in children.\r\n\r\nConclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of panic disorder below the age of 4. We conducted a literature review and found no cases published. This is an interesting case for psychiatrists, therapists and pediatricians to learn as there is a lack of evidence in treating children under the age of 4. No medication recommendations were available for this age group; however, off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication was discussed with the patient’s mother who refused. We agreed with the primary care team’s recommendations and the case was referred to an out-patient psychotherapist.",

This syndrome is particularly marked following sleep of 10 or more hr when the individual is not making up a sleep deficit. Under these conditions, the worn-out syndrome is more typical than feeling just great.

      "abstract": "Empirical results from epidemiological studies on pain-depression comorbidity in primary care and population samples have shown that: (a) pain is as strongly associated with anxiety as with depressive disorders; (b) characteristics that most strongly predict depression are diffuseness of pain and the extent to which pain interferes with activities; (c) certain psychological symptoms (low energy, disturbed sleep, worry) are prominent among pain patients, while others (guilt, loneliness) are not; (d) depression and pain dysfunction are evident early in the natural history of pain, but dysfunction and distress are often transient; and (e) among initially dysfunctional pain patients whose dysfunction is chronic, depression levels do not improve but neither do they increase over time with chronicity alone. These results seem consistent with these mechanisms of pain-depression comorbidity; (1) a trait of susceptibility to both dysphoric physical symptoms (including pain) and psychological symptoms (including depression), and a state of somatosensory amplification in which psychological distress amplifies dysphoric physical sensations (including pain); (2) psychological illness and behavioural dysfunction being interrelated features of a maladaptive response to pain evident early in the natural history of the condition, and often resolving during an early recovery phase; (3) pain constituting a significant physical and psychological stressor that may induce or exacerbate psychological distress. Thus, pain and psychological illness should be viewed as having reciprocal psychological and behavioural effects involving both processes of illness expression and adaption, as well as pain having specific effects on emotional state and behavioural function.",

Employers devote too little attention to it or are frequently not even aware of it. The majority of employers are in fact too often focused on the growing problem of absence from work because of sickness (absenteeism) and on eliminating the negative consequences of absenteeism, and do not (yet) see presenteeism as a problem. The research presented in this article deals with the question of the impact of employee characteristics on the phenomenon of presenteeism.

The biological and psychological causes for panic are considered; the success of Cognitive behavioural therapy as treatment indicates a strong psychological cause.",

Neurochemical, existential, sociogenic, familial, pathological, psychodynamic and behavioural explanations have all been offered as putative reasons for the psychological disorder, which in its various representations (panic disorder, obsessive‐compulsive disorder, phobias, post‐traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorders, etc.) can affect up to 20% of the population on a lifetime basis (1). Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations. Indeed, it is possible to argue that a cognitive impairment is the primary presenting feature of pathological anxiety, with the characteristic syndrome of somatic symptoms as secondary or necessary consequences of such cognitive disorder.",

      "abstract": "Postpartum depression is a medical condition in which a woman faces mental issues after delivery. Postpartum depression is associated with anxiety, mood swings, tiredness, feeling scared all the time, trouble sleeping or sleeping, weight loss, stress eating, losing interest, sudden weight gain, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions, fatigue and several other issues. It can happen during pregnancy as well as after giving birth. Some women experience baby blues while some experience postpartum depression. Women feel depressed and sadly most of the time. Depression can make it difficult for mother to take care of herself and the child. Various lifestyle choices also need to be mentioned while talking about factors causing PPD. Some factors affecting PPD are lack of physical activity and exercise, bad eating habits, disturbed sleep cycle etc. it may include hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, risk factors, psychological stress. One of the chief factors affecting postpartum depression is the sleep cycle. It is seen that less sleep is brought near to postnatal depression. Exercise, psychosocial support, physical stretching or working activity can decrease symptoms of depression. Exercise causes the release of mood-boosting hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, which elevates the mood. Low esteem caused by depression can be decreased by an elevated mood. Exercise can also increase endogenous endorphins and opioids which gives a positive mood. It also increases problem solving capacity and confidence. The most common management methods used for managing depression are psychological support, professional help, interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive therapy.",

      "abstract": "Sommario L’acromegalia è una malattia sistemica con segni e sintomi caratteristici, tra cui alterazioni delle caratteristiche facciali e ingrossamento delle estremità acrali. Sebbene le alterazioni neuropsicologiche non siano storicamente associate a questa malattia, la pratica clinica ha dimostrato che sintomi psicologici possono essere presenti nei pazienti acromegalici e avere un impatto significativo sulla qualità della vita. La qualità della vita nel paziente con acromegalia è un parametro importante per definire il compenso di malattia globale ed è direttamente influenzata, oltre che dalle terapie e dalla sintomatologia clinica, anche dal quadro neuropsicologico. Ad oggi, diversi studi hanno individuato una maggiore incidenza di patologia neuropsicologica nei pazienti affetti da acromegalia; in particolare, i pazienti hanno tassi più elevati di disturbi affettivi come depressione, ansia e disturbi somatici. Inoltre, come intuibile, anche le modificazioni dell’aspetto corporeo contribuiscono a innescare disturbi di percezione del proprio corpo che, oltre ad essere debilitanti di per sé, contribuiscono al mantenimento e all’aggravarsi della patologia psicologica in generale. Inoltre, valutazioni più complete e specialistiche dal punto di vista neurocognitivo hanno dimostrato come i pazienti acromegalici soffrano anche di una diminuzione della performance cognitiva in diversi domini, peggiorando ulteriormente il quadro globale e la qualità di vita. È interessante segnalare come tutte queste problematiche dipendenti dall’effetto di GH sul sistema nervoso centrale creino delle alterazioni a lungo termine, che non regrediscono con il raggiungimento del controllo o della cura di malattia. Per questo motivo, oltre ad auspicare ulteriori studi più approfonditi per meglio comprendere l’impatto di GH e IGF1 sul quadro neuropsicologico, raccomandiamo nella pratica clinica maggiore attenzione a questo aspetto, con un approccio sempre più multidisciplinare, comprendente anche la collaborazione di neuropsicologi, psichiatri e neurologi nel team dedicato al paziente acromegalico.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There exists an interplay between the process of aging and the experience of stress such that an individual's physical and mental health can be greatly affected by the stressful events that are experienced over time. While some of these events can be considered normal and expected occurrences of an individual moving through the life course, others can be described as a product of the historical context in which the individual resides. The combination of these stressful events, whether in the form of major role transitions, the development of chronic conditions, or the perpetuation of daily hassles, can have significant consequences on the health of aging individuals, and these consequences can be mediated by a host of other factors such as individual control of events, coping strategies, and social support.",

Presentación del caso: paciente con cuadro clínico que inicia a los 65 años, con disminución en la interacción social. Un par de meses después, la esposa nota que el lenguaje del paciente se torna poco fluido, habla con palabras o frases cortas, no logra decir oraciones completas, además de presentar cambios en la entonación de las palabras y alteraciones del lenguaje escrito. El paciente manifiesta que su principal limitación en el momento es el no poder expresar lo que quiere decir, y por este motivo consulta. Discusión: en el caso de este paciente, se describe inicialmente un cambio en su personalidad que no compromete su funcionalidad, sin embargo, al poco tiempo se presenta compromiso del lenguaje como síntoma prominente y que genera mayor compromiso en su calidad de vida, con pruebas neuropsicológicas y hallazgos de neuroimagen que apoyan el diagnóstico de afasia primaria progresiva (APP) variante no fluente o agramatical, con síntomas comportamentales y motores asociados. Conclusión: las APP son un grupo de trastornos neurocognitivos cuya característica primordial es el compromiso en el lenguaje, cada variante de APP tiene unas características clínicas y criterios diagnósticos específicos que se deben conocer para lograr sospechar el diagnóstico y hacer un abordaje apropiado en el paciente.",

Disabling chronic breathlessness, persisting despite optimum treatment of the underlying cause [2], is experienced by almost all patients with advanced lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [3], and carries a significant emotional, social, health and economic load. Intimately related to physical activity, chronic breathlessness reduces the ability to carry out activities of daily living [4] and restricts the role in the family, workplace or wider society [5]. These consequences, with additional frightening severe episodes of breathless crises, lead not only to acute emotional responses that not only widely activate a multitude of brain regions [6], but also promote the insidious development of depression, anxiety and panic, and a reduction in physical and mental quality of life proportionate with the severity of breathlessness [7].

In assessing for obsessions, persistence is first assessed, followed by distress and resistance. The interviewer should list and rate each obsession using the Feelings Thermometer. Diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder requires the presence of persistent obsessions, compulsions, or both (more than 1 hour each day) that are repetitive and difficult to control. In addition, the symptoms must cause marked distress or cause significant interference in functioning. If no evidence of obsessions or compulsions is obtained, the interviewer may skip to the section on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)/Acute Stress Disorder.",

For many candidates, their doctoral studies are undertaken through a period of youthful good health and positive developments in their social and family life, not to mention the challenge, excitement and camaraderie of their research activities.\r\nMany are less fortunate. A range of physical and mental illnesses are common in the community and offer no exemptions for scholarly high performers. Diseases such as asthma and diabetes, infections such as glandular fever or hepatitis, musculoskeletal injuries, mental disorders such as depression, or severe forms of anxiety and substance abuse are commonly encountered problems. There are many diseases that are less common, but that emerge from time to time, such as psychosis, leukaemia or multiple sclerosis. Adverse life circumstances may also take their toll, ranging from relationship breakups and family discord, to pressures juggling paid employment or financial difficulties.",

They are often described by others as being ‘highly strung’ or ‘nervy’. Domains of anxiety may include worrying that the worst will happen even after minor events, being especially sensitive about unexpected changes in their immediate environment, and getting upset over minor things that go wrong. People with this type of temperament are easily upset and stressed, and can seem tense and jumpy. When distressed, they tend to find comfort in talking to close friends about their worries and in seeking reassurance, or going quiet and keeping to themselves. Sometimes they may resort to temporary relief from their worries by engaging in pleasurable activities as a means of distraction.",

      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

Are symptoms of depression due to organic illness and thus likely to respond to treatment of the underlying physical illness, or, on the other hand, are they of psychological origin and thus require counseling or antidepressant therapy? This difficulty, in part, arises from a lack of distinction between depressive symptoms and depressive disorder. Fleeting depressive symptoms (such as decreased energy, difficulty sleeping) are quite common among acutely ill medical patients (in or outside of the Veterans Administration system); however, such symptoms are often different in intensity and duration from those that comprise a major depressive disorder. The latter (by DSM-III-R criteria) requires a depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day for 2 weeks or longer, and the simultaneous presence of a constellation of",

Attention disorders manifest themselves in the form of the following behavioral patterns: distractibility with disorganization of behavior and problems with stable focus on a task, which are not associated with a decrease in intelligence and lack of understanding of the proposed tasks. Hyperactivity is understood as excessive motor activity, fussiness, restlessness, or verbosity that is not adequate to accepted norms. Impulsive behavior involves quick, hasty, thoughtless, hurried actions that carry a high risk of serious harm and injury. Due to the great heterogeneity in the severity of clinical manifestations, this pathology tends to be diagnosed late, often with the start of schooling.",

El primero, entendido como una respuesta sostenida ante estímulos estresantes, puede desregular el organismo, impactando en los sistemas cardiovascular e inmunológico, y provocando síntomas como ansiedad y agotamiento. En este estudio, el 40 % de los encuestados reportó experimentar estrés frecuente, y un 25 % percibió demandas laborales que superan su capacidad, sumando un 65 % con percepción alta de desequilibrio. La carga mental, asociada a la exigencia cognitiva de las tareas, fue percibida como moderada por el 40 %, pero se reportaron síntomas frecuentes como dificultad para concentrarse, fatiga constante, irritabilidad, ansiedad y problemas de sueño. Respecto al apoyo institucional, el 80 % de los docentes considera inexistentes o limitadas las acciones para promover la salud mental, mientras que solo el 15 % percibe una promoción activa. La interacción entre alta demanda y escasos recursos intensifica el estrés y reduce la capacidad para gestionar la carga mental, cuya naturaleza silenciosa retrasa la intervención.

Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation. The number of studies conducted on BD depressive treatment is limited, the information was obtained by excluding this group from the studies or by compiling the information obtained from the treatment of unipolar depression.

In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction.

Lansia yang mengalami depresi cenderung tidak menunjukkan gejala afektif dan lebih cenderung menunjukkan perubahan kognitif, gejala somatik, dan kehilangan minat dibandingkan lansia yang lebih muda. Hal ini juga sering disalahartikan sebagai efek dari penyakit multipel dan obat-obatan yang digunakan untuk mengobatinya. Faktor risiko yang menyebabkan depresi pada usia lanjut adalah kerentanan genetik, penurunan kognitif, perubahan neurobiologis yang berkaitan dengan usia, insomnia, dan peristiwa yang membuat stres.

      "title": "Comorbidity of Depression and Conduct Disorder",
      "abstract": "Both depression and conduct disorders are relatively prevalent and are related to poor long-term outcomes. Despite being characterized by very different symptoms, it is well established that these two disorders co-occur at higher rates than expected by chance, resulting in poorer adjustment for the individual than would result from either problem alone. The term<italic>comorbidity</italic>is usually reserved to refer to the association of diagnosed disorders, whereas<italic>co-occurrence</italic>refers more broadly to the association of levels of symptoms of conduct problems and depression, which are usually calculated with means or possibly symptoms counts. In the past two decades, researchers have focused particularly on the following issues regarding the comorbidity of depression and conduct disorder: (1) possible causal associations of the two problem behaviors (i.e., do depressive disorders tend to onset after conduct disorders or vice versa); (2) theory regarding causes of the association (i.e., common versus unique risk factors for these two problem behaviors); (3) changes across development (i.e., with age); (4) risks from diagnosed disorders versus symptoms that do not reach diagnostic criteria; (5) outcomes or prognosis (e.g., are outcomes more severe for co-occurring problems than for either problem alone, are there distinct patterns of outcomes associated with co-occurring problems). Within each of these areas there is considerable interest in moderation of effects by gender or gender similarities and differences. This chapter reviews findings pertaining to these issues and presents suggestions for future research. In addition, assessment approaches and clinical implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Physical symptoms with no medical explanation are commonly experienced by healthy people and those attending clinics. Psychiatrists see such patients in liaison settings and clinics for those with psychotic and affective disorders. The pathophysiology remains obscure; physical investigations are usually performed to exclude pathology rather than elucidate dysfunction. However, modern neuroimaging has allowed the study of nervous system structure and function. Although there are few diagnostically specific findings, patterns of association have emerged: where action is impeded (certain forms of conversion disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome) frontal systems of the brain are often implicated; when subjective awareness of the body is disturbed (passivity phenomena and anorexia nervosa) temporo-parietal cortices appear to be dysfunctional. The caudate nuclei (components of the frontal executive circuit) are implicated in a variety of syndromes (including body dysmorphic disorder, somatisation and chronic fatigue). The brain may be viewed as a cognitive neurobiological entity, crucially oriented towards action (for survival). Psychiatric syndromes that have an impact on bodily awareness signal dysfunction within systems representing that body and its performance in time and space.",

      "abstract": "Stress is extremely complex. The state of the body and that of the mind are closely related. When we start to examine what that “something” is, it gets complex. Stress produces a state of physical and mental tension and frustration. Stress is not necessarily something bad, it is also positive and all depends on how we take it. If the mind is relaxed we can see, the muscles in the body will also be relaxed. Some stress can be useful. Stress is a normal, general and universal reaction to life events. It is what you feel when life demands more than you handle. Stress occurs too long or too often which causes problems. It can affect our normal daily routine. Too much stress increases the risk for mental and physical illness and weakens immune system. Stress problems are highly common with many people reporting experiencing extreme levels of distress or negative stress. Being “stressed out” is thus a common or universal human phenomenon that has an impact on almost everyone. When we have lot to do to, we tend to feel much more stressed out. Most people use the word stress to refer to negative experiences which leave us feeling submerged and unpleasant. Only few people enjoy the feeling of being overwhelmingly stressed in the face of great change. Our experiences and feeling of stressed varies in intensity between high, medium and low. People do not like experiencing the peak of stress. Meditation and yoga is recognised as a form of mind-body medicine and a very good relaxation technique. Even exercising has a very good benefit in relaxing the mind and body. We tend to ignore the difficulties of how and why stress makes us feel depressed, exhausted and function the way it does.Suitable and appropriate amount of stress can actually stimulate passion for work, tap hidden abilities and even provoke, ignite inspirations. Stress can make a person creative, productive and constructive, when it is identified and well managed.",

      "abstract": "To study the long-term clinical course and outcomes of atypical psychosis, 8 patients diagnosed with atypical psychosis were observed for more than 12 years (mean, 20 years). Retrospective examination was performed, particularly with respect to clinical features at each episode. The overall course of each case was classified as one of the following three types: Type I--\"Recurrent confused state\" type. Patients frequently repeated acute transient confused or dream-like states in a similar way, sometimes and/or for part of the episode accompanied by a floating paranoid-hallucinatory state. Duration of psychotic episode was short, persisting for a few days to about one month. Type II--\"Manic-depressive illness similar\" type. After a long course of disease, the predominantly early middle-aged patients (30- to 40 years-old) demonstrated fewer original characteristic features of acute confused or dream-like states. Instead, manic or depressive episodes tended to predominate. Duration of psychotic episodes exceeded the duration of type I episodes, to a maximum of about 3 months. Type III--\"Appearance of residual state\" type. After several episodes characterized by transient confused state during middle age, residual states consisting of a slight depressive state, reduced spontaneity and flattening of emotions appear. These states become durable and the periodicity of the disease disappeared. We conclude that the core group of atypical psychosis patients presents with confused symptoms as a clinical feature of episodes, and with the recurrent confused state type representing the long-term clinical course. \"Shift to manic-depressive illness similar\" and \"appearance of residual state\" types were considered to be derived from the core group, according to the interplay of personality structure and viable dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a widespread disorder affecting not only sleep quantity and quality, but also daytime well-being and performance, as well as having a negative impact on physical and mental health. Many people have problems falling asleep and maintaining sleep that do not reach the clinical criteria of insomnia. For all the prevalence of such sleep disorders, specialists often overlook a fundamentally important factor that affects sleep and wakefulness cycle, ease of falling asleep and daytime performance. These are circadian rhythms of the body under the control of the biological clock.This review highlights the specifics of the human biological clock and its relationship to insomnia and complaints of poor sleep. The phenomenon of the human chronotype as a set of individual preferences in sleep-wake rhythm is considered. Late chronotype, tat tends to wake up late and be active in the evening turns out to be the most vulnerable to the appearance of complaints of poor sleep and development of insomnia. This result is typical for different age groups. The reason for problems sleep for the late chronotype is the need to adjust to social demands and to fall asleep and wake up too early relative to the phase of one’s own circadian rhythm.Circadian rhythms may contribute to the formation and maintenance of insomnia. Both chronic and acute insomnia may have a chronobiological component that is not always considered. Late chronotype may be a factor further exacerbating the course of insomnia. The regularity of circadian rhythms may also be impaired in insomnia.The importance of the biological clock in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness also explains the successful approach to insomnia treatment with melatonin, which plays an important signaling role in the circadian regulation of the body.",

      "title": "Anxiety in the elderly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "abstract": "Anxiety is a complex phenomenon. It involves aversive components in behavioral contingencies and can manifest in both respondent and operant contexts. Anxiety is a common emotion that serves as a warning signal in challenging situations but can become uncontrollable, leading to physical and mental health issues, especially in the elderly. Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive fear and constant worry, often linked to genetic, environmental, and age-related factors. These disorders can negatively affect the quality of life and increase the risk of suffering and disability, especially in the elderly. Research has shown an inverse relationship between clinical anxiety and the quality of life in older individuals, leading to higher distress levels, functional impairment, and increased healthcare costs. Anxiety is also associated with memory problems in the elderly, further impacting their well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the impact of anxiety on the emotional well-being of the elderly. Social isolation during the pandemic has led to symptoms of depression, loneliness, and anxiety in both young and older individuals. Changes in daily routines, uncertainty about the future, and grief due to loss of loved ones have intensified these emotional responses. The pandemic has exacerbated the immune system's decline in older individuals, further affecting their emotional well-being. Psychosocial consequences of social isolation are not exclusive to the pandemic and have been observed in previous episodes of isolation. The loss of friends or family members of the same age during the pandemic has intensified emotional responses, including sadness, post-traumatic stress syndrome, and persistent grieving symptoms. In conclusion, anxiety is a multifaceted phenomenon that profoundly impacts the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of the elderly. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of addressing anxiety in this population, not only for their immediate well-being but also for the potential long-term consequences. Targeted interventions and support systems are crucial to help the elderly manage and mitigate anxiety effectively.",

      "title": "ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF SILEXAN IN PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY ANXIETY SYNDROMES",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Anxiety and depressive diseases represent leading causes of burden worldwide with a globally increasing prevalence and suffering [1]. Although the heterogeneous clinical presentations do not always fully meet the criteria required for a diagnosis of a full-blown psychiatric disease as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), the so-called “subthreshold” or “subsyndromal” severity consistently showed a long-term negative impact on general health, life quality and functionality, and hence a decreased working capability in the affected individuals [2, 3]. For both, subsyndromal as well as full-blown manifestations, beneficial clinical effects on anxious, depressive, psychosomatic and cognitive symptoms and favorable safety profile lacking pharmacological interactions, undesirable sedation, withdrawal symptoms, or abuse potential were repeatedly confirmed for Silexan in patients with primary anxiety syndromes [4, 5]. Additionally, in-vitro studies indicated stimulation of synaptic plasticity, and in rats repeated administration of Silexan decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test [6]. Aims &amp; Objectives Based on the available clinical and preclinical international evidence, the pharmacological profile suggests that Silexan, a proprietary active substance produced from Lavandula angustifolia Miller flowers that has been approved in many countries for the oral treatment of anxiety disorders, may also have an antidepressant effect [6]. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis based on data from placebo- controlled clinical trials with Silexan at a daily dose of 80 mg [7]. Methods The present meta-analysis investigating comorbid depressive symptoms was conducted based on five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials performed with Silexan in subthreshold anxiety (n = 3) and generalized anxiety disorders (n = 2) [7]. Results The results of the item depressed mood assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale clearly showed that Silexan has a beneficial effect on co-occurring depressive symptoms in these patients [7]. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 315 patients suffering from mixed anxiety and depressive disorder [7]. Silexan was significantly superior to placebo regarding the antidepressant efficacy measured with the Montgomery Å sberg Depression Rating Scale as well as the anxiolytic efficacy measured with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [7]. Discussion &amp; Conclusion Based on these encouraging results and the need for an antidepressant agent with a beneficial efficacy and tolerability profile lacking unfavorable pharmacological interactions or withdrawal symptoms harming the quality of life, especially in patients with milder forms of depression [4, 7, 8], the antidepressant efficacy of Silexan is currently being investigated in an international randomized placebo-and reference-controlled phase III trial in patients with a mild to moderate major depressive episode (EudraCT Number: 2020-000688-22).

      "title": "Estrés diario y calidad de vida en las personas con lesión medular espinal",
      "abstract": "La Lesion Medular Espinal (LME) refiere a un suceso vital mayor que provoca importantes y permanentes cambios. Consiste en un cese de la senal neuronal que oca-siona una restriccion de las funciones motoras, sensitivas y vegetativas por debajo de la lesion. Una LME afecta gravemente a las funciones y capacidades de la persona. El estres diario puede entenderse como de¬mandas coti¬dianas y frus¬trantes que condicionan la interac¬cion del sujeto con el medio. Se ha encontrado que un aumento en la percepcion de contrariedades predice un empeoramiento de la sintomatologia psicologica y somatica. Las personas con una LME se en¬frentan a un amplio conjunto de situa¬ciones estresantes novedo¬sas. La calidad de vida (CV) es un constructo complejo y aun no se ha alcanzado un acuerdo general en su definicion. Puede interpretarse como un estilo personal cuyas caracteristicas serian encontrar un equilibrio entre expectativas, esperanzas y realida-des conseguidas o asequibles. Los objetivos principales de esta tesis fueron el desarrollo y validacion de una es-cala de me¬dida del estres diario en la LME, por un lado, y la medida y valoracion de la CV en la poblacion de lesionados medulares, asi como por que variables resulta mas influenciada, por otro. Para cubrir el primer objetivo, desarrollamos la Escala de Estres Diario para la Lesion Medular Espinal (EED–LME–26). Resulta importante puesto que en la actuali-dad no existe ninguna herra¬mienta para este proposito en esta poblacion. Para su crea-cion se utilizo una muestra de 105 sujetos. Se realizo un analisis factorial exploratorio obteniendose 9 dimensiones del estres. Posteriormente, aplicando analisis factorial confirmatorio validamos 8 de las 9 dimensiones anteriores. La validez concurrente de la escala se com¬probo a traves de correla¬ciones con otras medidas del estres psicoso-cial, mostrando que nuestra escala es adecuada para la evaluacion del estres diario en la LME. Para estimar la CV en la LME, se valoro el impacto de diversos indicadores obje-tivos, variables sociodemograficas, y psicosociales asi como la relacion de CV con la salud subjetiva. A tal fin, se llevo a cabo un analisis de regresion multiple hacia ade-lante. Su resultado mostro que la CV en los participantes de nuestra muestra se asocia negativamente con la gravedad de la LME, con una peor salud fisica, y con un incre-mento en la variable “consumo de analgesicos”. Y hubo una correlacion positiva con un nivel alto de hardiness, apoyo social, y vivienda adaptada. Consideramos que la EED–LME–26 sera un instru¬mento que pueda utilizarse en investigacio¬nes sobre la influencia del estres diario en lesionados medulares.

En relacion con nuestro estudio de la CV en personas con una LME, se han proporcionado datos de interes tanto desde una perspectiva orientada a la salud, como, tambien, para colaborar con las distintas asociaciones de lesionados medulares y dis-capacitados, de manera que estas puedan emplearlos como un instrumento de sensibi-lizacion de los organismos oficiales. Adicionalmente, tanto la EED–LME–26 como las conclusiones derivadas de nuestra evaluacion de la CV en personas con una LME, podran resultar utiles de cara a actuar en lesionados medulares que no logran adaptarse a su nuevo entorno, que han perdido su trabajo y el panorama laboral no es propicio. Asimismo, resulta importante para establecer una optima relacion social y/o familiar. Logicamente tambien es im-portante que la sociedad asimile a los lesionados medulares como personas validas y capacitadas.",

      "abstract": "이 연구는 인류 최대의 성과로 인정되는 고령화가 전 세계적으로 급격히 진행되면서 발생하는 여러 가지 사회적, 심리적, 영적 과제들을 노인 우울증의 관점에서 논의한 논문이다. 노인들이 품위 있는 삶을 살아가려면 소득 보장과 건강의 문제에 우선순위를 두어야 한다. 그뿐 아니라 고령화가 불행이나 고통이 아닌 축복이 되게 하기 위해서는 품격과 정서적 안정감을 제공해야 한다. 특히 노년은 건강이나 배우자를 잃음으로, 경제적 능력을 상실함으로, 그 외에도 다양한 상실로 인해 우울증을 겪기 쉬운 시기이다. 우울한 노인들은 자신의 인생이 무가치하고 사랑받을 가치도 없다고 느낀다. 그러나 노인 우울증의 특징은 그런 증상들을 우울증이라 인지하기보다는 신체적 증상이라 여기며 호소하기 때문에 자칫 전문가라 하더라도 그런 증상을 놓치기 쉽다. 그러나 면밀하게 관찰하여 정확하게 진단할 수 있다면 노인 우울증은 치료될 수 있는 가능성이 높다. 거의 매일 우울한 기분, 슬픔, 무가치감, 죄책감, 구체적인 자살 계획 등이 동반된다면 치료자들은 반드시 우울증을 염두에 두어야 한다. 특히 가파르게 증가하는 독거노인들이 정서적 고갈로 고통을 겪지 않도록 교회는 눈을 이웃으로 돌려 돌봄과 섬김의 자원을 최대한 가동하기 시작해야 한다. 특히 정기적인 교회 출석과 돌보미들에 의한 대화는 독거노인들의 우울증을 감소시킨다. 과거에 대한 회상성이 증가하는 노인들의 이야기를 누군가가 친밀감을 가지고 경청해줄 때, 의미 있는 접촉을 통해 노인들은 우울증으로부터 회복될 수 있다. 교회는 무엇보다 죽음의 두려움을 이길 수 있는 영적 자원들을 활용함으로써 노인들의 정서적 회복 탄력성을 강화시키고, 기독교의 특권인 공동체의 활용과 사회적 지원을 통해 ‘사랑스런 공동체’를 세워가야 할 것이다.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of psychotic disorders that develop later in life is complicated, as can be seen from the case of a 65-year-old woman. Initially she was admitted to hospital for psychotic depression, but after some time doubts arose regarding the diagnosis. The most striking symptoms were bizarre delusions with acoustic, haptic and gustatory hallucinations. In addition, she showed behavioral and personality changes. It is difficult to establish whether a patient has late-onset schizophrenia or frontotemporal dementia. The similarities and differences between the symptoms of these two disorders are discussed and advice is given to assist with clinicians with diagnosis in the future.",

They can have a variety of nonpain symptoms due to their serious illness. Literature suggests these symptoms can be more debilitating than pain, but patients are less likely to self-report. Surgical palliative care providers have an important opportunity to manage these nonpain symptoms to improve a patient’s quality of life.

Often associated with other symptoms (pain, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, stress etc.), fatigue affects the daily life of patients as much as or even more than pain. This multi-factored and annoying symptom is linked to physical, cognitive and affective functioning, which must be assessed (Piper fatigue scale). Beside the medical management, nursing research found four efficient interventions to reduce fatigue: educating patients and their families, programming physical conditioning and activities to restore the attention, improving diet, hydration and sleep. The pluridisciplinary management of this symptom is a key factor to a better quality of life.",

Although convulsive SE is recognized as a medical emergency, prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with NCSE is often not emphasized because its consequences are thought to be benign. We report 10 patients with persistent neurologic deficits or death after well-documented NCSE in the form of complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). All patients had prolonged CPSE lasting 36 hours or longer, as documented by clinical and EEG findings. Causes for CPSE were preexisting epilepsy with partial and secondarily generalized seizures (3 patients), vascular disease (2 patients), encephalitis (2 patients), and metabolic disease (1 patient); causes were unknown for two patients. Poor outcomes identified included persistent (lasting at least 3 months) or permanent cognitive or memory loss (5 patients), cognitive or memory loss plus motor and sensory dysfunction (3 patients), and death (3 patients). NCSE in the form of CPSE is not a benign entity. Serious morbidity and mortality may occur due to the adverse effects of prolonged seizures and as a result of acute brain disorders that precipitate the seizures.",

      "title": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic and highly comorbid illness characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry (Box 19- ). It is marked by a later onset than other anxiety disorders (Kessler et al. 2005) and is associated with fluctuations in symptom severity and impairment (e.g., Wittchen et al. 2000). It demonstrates both a low probability of recovery (32%–58%) and a high likelihood of recurrence (45%–52%) (Rodriguez et al. 2006) over a 2- to 12-year period. GAD is associated with significant disability and impairment comparable to pure major depressive disorder (Hoffman et al. 2008) and can be more debilitating than pure substance use disorders, some anxiety disorders, and personality disorders, even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and comorbid conditions (Grant et al. 2005). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder 300.02 F41.1 Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). The individual finds it difficult to control the worry. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months): Note: Only one item is required in children. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge. Being easily fatigued. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank. Irritability. Muscle tension. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep). The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder). Individuals with GAD attempt to enhance their sense of control or preparedness through anticipation of negative outcomes or worst-case scenarios. They scan their environment for potential danger and negatively interpret neutral or ambiguous stimuli as threatening (Mathews and MacLeod 1994). Because of their lack of present moment focus, these individuals tend to ignore information in their immediate surroundings that could potentially challenge their distorted views (Borkovec and Newman 1998), which triggers emotional distress. This emotional distress is associated with many somatic features, including restlessness, fatigue, irritability, concentration difficulties, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. Overall, GAD is a serious and costly mental illness with regard to degree of distress, disability and subsequent loss of work productivity, and quality of life (Newman 2000). Thus, targeted interventions are necessary to effectively address core symptoms and associated features. In this chapter we discuss several empirically established approaches to treatment for GAD, including conventional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and integrative psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Alterations of Circadian Rhythmicity and Sleep in Aging: Endocrine Consequences",
      "abstract": "All 24-hour endocrine rhythms partially reflect the interaction of circadian rhythmicity with sleep-wake homeostasis but their relative contributions vary from one system to another. In older adults, many 24-hour rhythms are dampened and/or advanced, including those of cortisol and GH. Amplitude reduction and phase advance of 24-hour rhythms may represent age-related changes in the central nervous systems underlying circadian rhythmicity and sleep-wake homeostasis. Age-related alterations in circadian function could also reflect decreased exposure and/or responsivity to the synchronizing effects of both photic (e.g. light exposure) and nonphotic (e.g. social cues) inputs. There are pronounced age-related alterations in sleep quality in aging which consist primarily of a marked reduction of slow-wave sleep, a reduction in REM stages and a marked increase in the number and duration of awakenings interrupting sleep. Alterations in slow-wave sleep occur abruptly in young adulthood (30–40 years of age) whereas disturbances in amounts of REM and wake appear more gradually. This article reviews evidence indicating that deficits in characteristics of sleep-wake homeostasis and circadian function may mediate age-related alterations in somatotropic and corticotropic function. Because sleep loss in young subjects results in endocrine disturbances which mimic those observed in aging, it is conceivable that the decrease in sleep quality which characterizes aging may contribute to age-related alterations in hormonal function and their metabolic consequences.",

      "abstract": "Депресията е често срещано психическо разстройство, представя се с депресивно настроение, загуба на интерес или удоволствие, намалена енергия, чувство за вина или ниска самооценка, нарушен сън или апетит и лоша концентрация. Освен това депресията често идва със симптоми на безпокойство. Тя може да доведе до различни емоционални и физически проблеми и да намали способността на човек да функционира на работното място и у дома. Депресията е различна от колебанията в настроението, които хората изпитват като част от нормалния живот. Временните емоционални отговори на предизвикателствата на ежедневието не представляват депресия. Депресията и тревожните разстройства са различни, но хората с депресия често изпитват симптоми, подобни на тези на тревожно разстройство, като нервност, раздразнителност и проблеми със съня и концентрацията. Но всяко разстройство има свои собствени причини и собствени емоционални и поведенчески симптоми. Много хора, които развиват депресия, имат история на тревожно разстройство по-рано в живота си. Няма данни, че едно разстройство причинява другото, но има ясни доказателства, че много хора страдат от двете заболявания. Депресивните разстройства включват две основни подкатегории: тежко депресивно разстройство / депресивен епизод, което включва симптоми като депресивно настроение, загуба на интерес и намалена енергия. В зависимост от броя и тежестта на симптомите депресивният епизод може да бъде категоризиран като лек, умерен или тежък. Дистимия, персистираща или хро нична форма на лека депресия. Симптомите на дистимия са подобни на депресивен период, но са склонни да бъдат по-малко интензивни и да продължават по-дълго. Депресията е рисков фактор за суицидни мисли (има много повече опити за самоубийство, отколкото завършени действия). Депресията засяга 350 милиона души. Търсенето на ограничаване на депресията и други състояния на психичното здраве се увеличават в световен мащаб.",

      "abstract": "Objective U.S. military special operation forces represent the most elite units of the U.S. Armed Forces. Their selection is highly competitive, and over the course of their service careers, they experience intensive operational training and combat deployment cycles. Yet, little is known about the health-care needs of this unique population. Method Professional consultations with over 50 special operation forces operators (and many spouses or girlfriends) over the past 6 years created a naturalistic, observational base of knowledge that allowed our team to identify a unique pattern of interrelated medical and behavioral health-care needs. Results We identified a consistent pattern of health-care difficulties within the special operation forces community that we and other special operation forces health-care providers have termed “Operator Syndrome.” This includes interrelated health and functional impairments including traumatic brain injury effects; endocrine dysfunction; sleep disturbance; obstructive sleep apnea; chronic joint/back pain, orthopedic problems, and headaches; substance abuse; depression and suicide; anger; worry, rumination, and stress reactivity; marital, family, and community dysfunction; problems with sexual health and intimacy; being “on guard” or hypervigilant; memory, concentration, and cognitive impairments; vestibular and vision impairments; challenges of the transition from military to civilian life; and common existential issues. Conclusions “Operator Syndrome” may be understood as the natural consequences of an extraordinarily high allostatic load; the accumulation of physiological, neural, and neuroendocrine responses resulting from the prolonged chronic stress; and physical demands of a career with the military special forces. Clinical research and comprehensive, intensive immersion programs are needed to meet the unique needs of this community.",

      "title": "Adolescent Sjogren’s syndrome presenting as psychosis: a case series",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Neurological involvement has been reported in up to 80% of adults with Primary Sjogren’s syndrome (pSS) with psychiatric abnormalities including anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction being common. Psychosis due to pSS has been reported in adult patients but has never been previously reported in the adolescent/pediatric literature. Here we describe for the first time four cases of adolescent Sjogren’s syndrome that presented with psychotic symptoms. Rituximab treatment was followed by improvement of psychiatric symptoms in all patients. Case presentation 1 : 16 year old female without significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with 4 days of abnormal behavior, tremors, insomnia, polyphagia, polyuria, and suicidal ideation. 2 : 16 year old female with a 4 year history of severe anxiety, OCD, and tic disorder treated with fluoxetine with partial benefit presented with an abrupt and severe worsening of anxiety, OCD and new auditory hallucinations. 3 : 19 year old female without significant past medical history presented with a 3 day history of progressively altered behavior, incoherent speech, insomnia, headache, and tangential thoughts. 4 : 17 year old female without significant past medical history presented with new onset suicidal ideation, paranoia, confusion, and emotional lability. Conclusion Psychosis is more common in autoimmune disease than previously known. To our knowledge, the four teenage women described above are the first reported patients with adolescent pSS manifesting as psychosis. pSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of young patients with new psychiatric disorders, even in the absence of sicca symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms improved with rituximab infusions in all 4 of our patients, which suggests rituximab may be an effective treatment option that should be considered early after the diagnosis of pSS-associated psychiatric disturbance.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of A Cognitive Behavior Programme In Reducing Obsessive Compulsive Disorder among College Students",
      "abstract": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is considered among the most painful psychological disorders. It is characterized by a number of obsessive compulsive thoughts that come ruminatively over the mind of the individual in such an unavoidable way that it would be hard to get rid of them, even though there are frequent attempts on the part of the individual to resist those thoughts. In fact, the individual does realize how trivial, irrational and illogical such thoughts are. Examples of them are thinking of God, Universe, and importance of the individual; plus fears from microbes, diseases, and so forth. Even worse, they could be a reason for the individual’s obsession, which in turn leads to the neglect of the individual’s daily practical interests. Also, the OCD is characterized by a number of acts, rituals, and motor impulses made frequently on a regular basis. Those accompanying characteristics, however insignificant and petty, take the form of a lofty desire. The following are among the most frequent and common compulsive acts and rituals: Washing the hands over hundreds of times unnecessarily, washing the body after excretion or in the course of menstruation, non-accompanying the others, holing everything with paper in fear of contamination, etc. Even so, these compulsive acts and rituals could not be done, while only the obsessive thoughts continue.\r\n\r\n\tProblem of Study\r\nThe OCD causes a whole lot of trouble to the individual or the university student; it leads to a down-beat state, a waste of time and effort, and substantial intervention into the most straightforward every-day activities. This, in its entirety, could result in scholastic achievement and retardation in the process of learning; even, perhaps, this could bring about the dropping out of education for the frequent failure; not to mention, the deterioration of social activities and family relations, and relations with others. Hence the need for a program, resting on the cognitive-behavioral technical therapy, for alleviating the COD.\r\n\r\n\tThe Study Problem consists in tackling the following queries:\r\n\r\n1-\tHow far is the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral program in alleviating the OCD for a sample of university students?\r\n2-\tHow far is the continuing effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy in alleviating the OCD after the follow-up period?\r\n\r\n\r\n\tSignificance of Study\r\n\r\n1-\tTreating the OCD through a program that rests on cognitive-behavioral technical therapy.\r\n2-\tScarcity of Arab studies, to the researcher’s knowledge, that handled the therapy of the OCD, particularly the cognitive-behavioral therapy.\r\n3-\tAvoiding the use of other therapeutic techniques, especially the medicinal therapy with its bad side-effects on the disordered person; and, also, avoiding the psyco-analytic therapy which may demand great effort and time, not to mention skepticism about its results.\r\n4-\tTreating the OCD enables the individual, particularly, university students, to save time and effort and to rid themselves of being downbeat; it also aids them in enhancing the social relations, which were once deteriorating on account of the OCD.\r\n5-\tAlleviating the suffering from the OCD results in a better mental hygiene on the individual’s part and getting rid of a lot of the accompanying disorders.\r\n\r\n\tAims of the Study\r\n \r\nThe present study aims at alleviating the OCD for a sample of students at the Faculty of Education via testing the effectiveness of a program that rests on the technicality of a cognitive-behavioral therapy and the continuity of the effectiveness of such a program on the experimental group after the follow-up period. \r\n\r\nTerms of Study\r\na-\tObsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\r\nb-\tCognitive-behavioral Therapy \r\n\r\n\r\n\tHypotheses of Study\r\n\r\n1-\tThere are differences of statistical significance between the grade average of the individuals of the two groups (experimental-static) on the scale of the OCD in favor of the experimental group after applying the program.\r\n2-\tThere are differences of statistical significance between the grade average of the experimental group for the two measurements (pre- and post-) on the scale of the OCD in favor of the post-scale.\r\n3-\tThere are no differences of statistical significance between the grade average of the individuals of the two scales (pre- and post-) on the scale of the OCD.\r\n4-\tThere are differences of statistical significance between the grade average of the individuals of the two groups (experimental-static) on the scale of the OCD in favor of the experimental group after the follow-up period.\r\n5-\tThere are no differences of statistical significance between the grade average of the experimental group of the two scales (pre- and post-) on the scale of the OCD.\r\n6-\tThere are no differences of statistical significance between the grade average of the static group of the two scales (pre- and post-) on the scale of the OCD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tSample of Study \r\na-\tExploratory Study Sample:\r\nThe tools of diagnosis have been applied to a large sample of university students totaling around (316) from the 2nd and 3rd year students (scientific as well as literary Departments) of Faculty of Education, Kafr El-Sheikh University; they are divided into 90 males and 216 females with a view to obtaining the exploratory study sample reaching 3 students (one male student and two female students) of the 2nd year, as a means of verifying the validity of the program.\r\nb-\tBasic Study Sample: \r\nIt is composed of 10 students (males and females), with an age that ranges from 19 to 23 years, who are suffering from the OCD.\r\nThey are divided into two groups:\r\n1-\tExperimental with 5 (2 male students and 3 female students)\r\n2-\tStatic with 5 (2 male students and 3 female students)\r\n\r\n\tFindings of Study\r\n\r\n1-\tThe effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral programs on alleviating the acuteness of the OCD afflicting university students.\r\n2-\tThe effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral programs on modifying the negative and irrational ideas relevant to the OCD\r\n3-\tThe continuity of the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral programs on alleviating the acuteness for the experimental group over the follow-up period that reaches about 3 months. \r\n\r\n\t The recommendations of the study\r\n\r\nIn the light of the results of the present study, the study recommends the following : \r\n\r\n1-\tTraining parents not to support obsessive ideas and actions,and compulsive movement rituals in children , which are acause of suffering from obsessive –compulsive disorder.\r\n2-\t 2-training university students on cognitive programs or , through school curricule , on scientific and critical thinking , that help to get rid of irrational and negative thoughts , which are acause of suffering from psychological disorders .\r\n3-\tincreasing the family awareness through not supporting negative and irrational thoughts , especially those which are related to obsessive – compulsive disorder through specialized counseling programs.\r\n4-\t Setting up specialized contres of cognitive behavior therapy for psychological disorder in particular .\r\n5-\tincreasing the individuals' awareness through mass madia concerning the necessity of asking for psychological consultation when suffering from any psychological disorder , especially obsessive – compulsive disorder so that the problem may not increase .\r\n6-\tthe necessity that apsychologist must be inside colleges to present psychological consultation for students , especially in colleges for non- specialists",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

Qui ne s’est jamais senti anxieux face la survenue d’un evenement important, qui ne s’est jamais plaint d’etre deprime certains jours maussades ? Pourtant, l’anxiete comme la depression peuvent donner lieu a des troubles psychiatriques majeurs, associes a d’importantes perturbations cognitives. Ces perturbations ont ete mises en evidence voici deja de nombreuses annees. La depression, en particulier, entraine chez le patient de reelles difficultes psycho-motrices, se manifestant notamment par un ralentissement general ainsi que des troubles mnesiques, attentionnels, et executifs. Ces alterations ont pu etre associees a differentes modifications du cerveau meme, attestant de bouleversements profonds de la structure cerebrale et des connexions neuronales, a la source ou consecutives a l’etat depressif. Outre ces perturbations que nous qualifierons de cognitives, des difficultes du traitement emotionnel ont egalement ete demontrees. Plus specifiquement, les patients depressifs semblent manifester un biais lorsqu’ils doivent analyser du materiel emotionnel. Ce biais est decrit comme un traitement affecte (dans le sens d’une facilitation ou au contraire d’un ralentissement) de tout contenu a valence emotionnel, comprenant par exemple des mots a valence emotionnelle (designant des emotions, des sentiments), des textes ou scenario, des scenes visuelles ou des visages. Dans ce chapitre, nous tenterons de synthetiser les principaux apports de la psychopathologie cognitive a l’etude de ces deux grands syndromes que sont la depression et les troubles anxieux. En nous centrant sur le theme des expressions faciales emotionnelles, nous passerons en revue les principales donnees comportementales obtenues a travers de paradigmes classiques, et nous montrerons comment les etudes utilisant l’imagerie ou l’electrophysiologie ont utilise ces paradigmes pour mettre en lumiere le fonctionnement cerebral des patients.",

      "abstract": "Any change in the social or physical environment that threatens the needs or interests of a mammal, induces a state of tension ('stress') in the animal. Driven by this tension, the animal changes its behaviour. At the same time, alterations occur in bodily functions. All organs and regulatory systems (central and peripheral nervous systems, endocrine and immune systems) participate in these behaviour-physiological response and are affected in their activities. The character of the reactions (e.g. fight, flight, passivity) is mainly determined by the animals appraisal of the environmental change and of the possible impact of its response. Aim of the reactions is neutralising the threat and gaining control over the environment (adaptation). When this is achieved, the tension recedes. In case the response is unsuccessful, the state of tension persists ('chronic stress'). Prolonged exposure of brain and/or bodily functions to stress can result in pathological states.",

      "title": "Agitation und Aggression in der Psychiatrie",
      "abstract": "Akute Agitation und Aggression zählen mit einer Prävalenz mit über 10 % zu den häufigsten medizinischen Notfallsituationen in der Psychiatrie [1]. Fast jeder zweite Patient, der in eine psychiatrische Notaufnahme kommt, weist Symptome von Agitation auf. Im deutschsprachigen Raum wird unter Agitation in der Regel ein Syndrom verstanden, das durch psychomotorische Unruhe, Erregung und Gespanntheit gekennzeichnet ist und das von stillem Negativismus bis hin zur Hostilität reichen kann [2]. Diese können in wechselnder Ausprägung und in der Intensität rasch veränderlich vorliegen. Häufig wird weitgehend synonym, aber doch mit etwas anderem Schwerpunkt der Begriff (psychomotorischer) Erregungszustand verwendet, der vor allem durch eine ausgeprägte Antriebssteigerung sowie motorische Hyperaktivität gekennzeichnet ist. Sowohl Agitation als auch psychomotorischer Erregungszustand können schließlich mit Gereiztheit, Aggressivität und Kontrollverlust einhergehen. In der angloamerikanischen Literatur wird Agitation dagegen besonders durch ausgeprägte motorische oder verbale Hyperaktivität oder durch Reizbarkeit und unkooperatives Verhalten charakterisiert [3], ein Bild, das eher dem (psychomotorischen) Erregungszustand nach deutschem Verständnis entspricht. Konkrete Anzeichen von Agitation sind z. B. motorische Unruhe, Hin-und-Her-Gehen, intensives Gestikulieren, laute Sprache mit Drohgebärden, Reizbarkeit, Impulsivität sowie mangelnde Kooperation. Die Übergänge zwischen Agitation und Aggression sind fließend. Mündet Agitation in Aggression, kann sich daraus eine akute Gefährdung des Patienten oder seines sozialen Umfelds entwickeln [4]. Aggression umfasst jegliche Form von verbalem, nonverbalem oder körperlichem Verhalten, das für den Patienten selbst, für andere Personen oder für deren Eigentum bedrohlich ist. Agitiertes Verhalten führt häufig zu Aggression und Gewalt. Bei psychiatrischen Patienten wird in bis zu über 80 % der Gewaltdelikte agitiertes Verhalten beobachtet. Insbesondere unbehandelte, junge, männliche Patienten mit Psychosen gelten als Hochrisikogruppe, vor allem, wenn komorbider Substanzmissbrauch hinzukommt [5].",

      "abstract": "espanolLa esquizofrenia es un trastorno psicotico grave. Se manifiesta con una variedad de signos y sintomas caracteristicos. Estos sintomas afectan a la percepcion (alucinaciones), ideacion, comprobacion de la realidad (delirios), procesos de pensamiento (asociaciones laxas), sentimientos (afecto plano, afecto inapropiado), atencion, concentracion, motivacion y juicio. No hay ningun sintoma que por si solo sea patognomonico de la esquizofrenia. Los sintomas caracteristicos de la enfermedad se clasifican en positivos, negativos (o deficit) y desorganizacion. Se estima que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia a lo largo de la vida esta entre el 0.7 y el 1.5%. Afecta de forma similar a ambos sexos. Esta enfermedad es habitualmente de tipo cronico y puede caracterizarse por tres fases (fase aguda, fase de estabilizacion y fase estable) que se fusionan unas con otras sin que existan unos limites claros y absolutos entre ellas. El tratamiento farmacologico es necesario, pero para tener una respuesta eficaz hay que combatir tambien con diversos problemas de indole social, psicoeducacion, tecnicas sociales y de afrontamiento y rehabilitacion, en una red de salud mental formada por equipos interdisciplinares. EnglishSchizophrenia is a serious psychotic disorder. It manifests itself with a variety of characteristic signs and symptoms. These symptoms affect perception (hallucinations), ideation, reality check (delusions), thought processes (lax associations), feelings (flat affect, inappropriate affect), attention, concentration, motivation, and judgment. There are no symptoms that alone are pathognomonic for schizophrenia. The characteristic symptoms of the disease are classified as positive, negative (or deficit) and disorganization. The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.5%. It affects both sexes in a similar way. This disease is usually chronic in nature and can be characterized by three phases (acute phase, stabilization phase and stable phase) that merge with each other without there being any clear and absolute limits between them. Pharmacological treatment is necessary, but in order to have an effective response, it is also necessary to combat various problems of a social nature, psychoeducation, social techniques and coping and rehabilitation, in a mental health network made up of interdisciplinary teams.",

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality.

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

      "title": "Overtraining in endurance athletes: a brief review",
      "abstract": "Overtraining is an imbalance between training and recovery, exercise and exercise capacity, stress and stress tolerance. Stress is the sum of training and nontraining stress factors. Peripheral (short-term overtraining, STO) or peripheral and central fatigue may result (long-term overtraining, LTO). STO lasting a few days up to 2 wk is termed overreaching. STO is associated with fatigue, reduction, or stagnation of the 4 LT performance capacity (performance at 4 mmol lactate or comparable criterion), reduction of maximum performance capacity, and brief competitive incompetence. Recovery is achieved within days, so the prognosis is favorable, LTO lasting weeks or months causes overtraining syndrome or staleness. The symptomatology associated with overtraining syndrome has changed over the last 50 yr from excitation and restlessness (so-called sympathetic form) to phlegmatic behavior and inhibition (so-called parasympathetic form). Increased volume of training at a high-intensity level is likely the culprit. The parasympathetic form of overtraining syndrome dominates in endurance sports. Accumulation of exercise and nonexercise fatigue, stagnation, or reduction of the 4 LT performance capacity, reduction in maximum performance capacity, mood state disturbances, muscle soreness/stiffness, and long-term competitive incompetence can be expected. Complete recovery requires weeks and months, so the prognosis is unfavorable. Other optional or further confirmation requiring findings include changes in blood chemistry variables, hormone levels, and nocturnal urinary catecholamine excretion. Based on the findings reported, recommendations for training monitoring can be made, but their relevance in the practice must still be clarified.",

      "abstract": "Although a universally accepted definition is lacking, mild traumatic brain injury and concussion are classified by transient loss of consciousness, amnesia, altered mental status, a Glasgow Coma Score of 13 to 15, and focal neurologic deficits following an acute closed head injury. Most patients recover quickly, with a predictable clinical course of recovery within the first one to two weeks following traumatic brain injury. Persistent physical, cognitive, or behavioral postconcussive symptoms may be noted in 5 to 20 percent of persons who have mild traumatic brain injury. Physical symptoms include headaches, dizziness, and nausea, and changes in coordination, balance, appetite, sleep, vision, and hearing. Cognitive and behavioral symptoms include fatigue, anxiety, depression, and irritability, and problems with memory, concentration and decision making. Women, older adults, less educated persons, and those with a previous mental health diagnosis are more likely to have persistent symptoms. The diagnostic workup for subacute to chronic mild traumatic brain injury focuses on the history and physical examination, with continuing observation for the development of red flags such as the progression of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms, seizure, progressive vomiting, and altered mental status. Early patient and family education should include information on diagnosis and prognosis, symptoms, and further injury prevention. Symptom-specific treatment, gradual return to activity, and multidisciplinary coordination of care lead to the best outcomes. Psychiatric and medical comorbidities, psychosocial issues, and legal or compensatory incentives should be explored in patients resistant to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is a discomfort and a kind of fear feeling of which individuals do not know the reasons but feel against the events which they regard dangerous and threatening. The indicator of anxiety in behaviors is a switch from the state of excessive excitement and activeness to sluggishness. Fear, nervousness, excessive anger, disgust, tiredness, muscle aches and psychological complaints are the most common indicators of the anxiety. “State anxiety” is permanent emotional reactions which the individual shows to the permanent states of which the density changes according to the conditions. “The state anxiety” level is high in the conditions which the individual comprehends the stressing state as threatening and it is low in the conditions which the danger is not comprehended as threatening. “State Anxiety” affects the sportsman’s motivation, concentration, coordination, the ability to determine, self-confidence, kondisyonel and coordinative abilities, which may be determinative on his/her performance. “State Anxiety” , which is occurred before or during the events that are called dangerous, is generally based on logical reasons and can be understood by other people. Trait anxiety is the perceiving the situations causing stress as a dangerous or threatening and the increasing and gaining continuity of the frequency and the density of emotional reactions against these threats. Trait anxiety is common and continuous anxiety which does not depend on a certain event or situation.. As the aim in sports competitions is based on probability of winning and losing, desire to have a good performance to be able to win sometimes creates negative impacts, and increasing complex emotions bring about the bad performance. Sports psychologists have consensus that it is necessary for the athletes to have a certain anxiety level for high performance. Lower or higher level affects the performance negatively. High anxiety level for the athletes is generally attained as the athletes come close to the borders of performance capacity. In other words, while coming close to the borders of performance capacity, anxiety density is increasing. If the athletes’ emotions are on the level of enthusiasm, horror or anger, many mental functions particularly thinking and perceiving get weak, and it is not possible to carry out activities consciously. To reach psycho-physic balance condition that a sportsman has, it is necessary to abolish the emotions. On the other hand, it is a big mistake to go on keeping the player on the game and expect a result. The physiological reactions which are shown by the people coming into anxiety process show themselves in the situations as difficulty in breathing, arthralgia, fatigue, headache, angriness, insomnia, anorexia or belly, smoking and using alcohol more, shirking his/her duty, ambivalence, amnesia, impatience, imbalance, having nightmare, gastric, infarction risk.

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

      "title": "First oral treatment zuranolone’s FDA approval and its impact on postpartum depression: a new hope – a correspondence",
      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a type of mood disorder that affects some individuals after they give birth. It is characterized by a range of emotional and physical symptoms that can significantly impact a new parent's well-being, their ability to care for their baby, and their overall quality of life. PPD typically occurs within the first few weeks or months after childbirth, but it can develop anytime during the first year. New parents with PPD often experience intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emptiness. Irritability, mood swings, and excessive crying are also common. PPD can manifest with physical symptoms such as fatigue, changes in appetite (either overeating or loss of appetite), and disruptions in sleep patterns (difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much). Individuals with PPD might have trouble concentrating, making decisions, or focusing on tasks1. PPD affects a significant number of new parents in the United States. It is estimated that around one in seven women (or about 14–20%) experience PPD after giving birth. Women who have previously experienced PPD are at a higher risk of experiencing it again with subsequent pregnancies. The recurrence rate for PPD is estimated to be around 30–50%. Many cases of PPD go undiagnosed and untreated. Only about 15% of individuals with PPD receive professional help2. In 2017, a research study revealed that suicide constituted ~5% of perinatal fatalities among Canadian women, predominantly happening within the initial 3 months following childbirth due to PPD3. Current treatment of PPD includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline and fluoxetine are commonly prescribed for PPD (Table 1). Table 1 - Pharmacological treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and escitalopram (Lexapro) are often considered first-line treatments for postpartum depression (PPD). They work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which can help alleviate depressive symptoms. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) SNRIs like venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) also affect serotonin levels, but they additionally impact norepinephrine. These medications can be effective for PPD in some cases. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) While less commonly prescribed due to potential side effects, TCAs like amitriptyline and nortriptyline may be considered when other options are not effective or well-tolerated. Atypical antidepressants Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is an example of an atypical antidepressant that affects both dopamine and norepinephrine. It can be used as an alternative for individuals who have not responded to SSRIs or SNRIs. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) MAOIs like phenelzine (Nardil) are usually reserved for cases where other treatments have failed due to their potential interactions with certain foods and medications. Yet, these medications can take weeks to work and may lead to side effects. Concerns about breastfeeding can also impact treatment decisions. Estrogen therapy stabilizes hormone levels linked to PPD, but it is still being studied, and its risks and side effects need more investigation. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps manage PPD symptoms by changing negative thought patterns. However, access to qualified therapists can be limited, and attending regular sessions might be challenging for new mothers. Recently FDA approved first oral treatment of zuranolone to treat PPD4. Zuranolone belongs to a class of drugs known as positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors. GABA-A receptors are critical components of the central nervous system that play a crucial role in regulating mood, anxiety, and other emotional states. Zuranolone's mechanism of action involves enhancing the activity of GABA-A receptors. GABA-A receptors are inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, and their activation leads to a reduction in neuronal excitability, thereby promoting relaxation and calming effects. By acting as a positive allosteric modulator, zuranolone amplifies the response of GABA-A receptors to the neurotransmitter GABA, resulting in anxiolytic and antidepressant effects4. For treating PPD, the efficacy of Zurzuvae in adults was assessed by conducting two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind and multicenter studies5. During this phase 3 trial with a double-blind design, women experiencing severe PPD were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a daily dosage of 50 mg zuranolone or a placebo for a period of 14 days. The primary focus of the study was to assess the change in the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) from their initial state on day 15. Noteworthy secondary objectives included measuring changes in HAM-D scores on days 3, 28, and 45, as well as evaluating the alteration in severity based on the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI-S) on day 15. Throughout the trial, adverse events were closely monitored and recorded. Among the 196 patients who were randomly assigned (zuranolone, N=98; placebo, N=98), a total of 170 participants (86.7%) successfully completed the 45-day study period. The utilization of zuranolone in comparison to the placebo yielded statistically notable enhancements in depressive symptoms by day 15. Moreover, significant amelioration in depressive symptoms was also noted5. Zuranolone can be more discreet and less stigmatizing compared to other forms of treatment, such as injections or hospital visits. This may encourage more individuals to seek help for their PPD symptoms. It will have higher rates of patient compliance since they are simple to take and integrate into daily routines. It can be distributed through a wider range of healthcare settings, potentially increasing accessibility to PPD treatment in both urban and rural areas. It can provide flexibility in dosing, allowing healthcare providers to tailor treatment plans to the individual needs of each patient. It can facilitate early intervention for PPD and has the potential to reduce hospitalization. Although zuranolone's FDA approval for PPD is promising, there are still some challenges to consider for its use. Not all individuals may respond equally to zuranolone, leading to variations in its effectiveness. Some women might experience significant improvements, while others might not see the same results. Like any medication, zuranolone could potentially have side effects ranging from mild to severe. Balancing the benefits with the potential risks is essential. The long-term effects of using zuranolone, especially during the postpartum period, need further exploration. Monitoring its impact on both maternal health and infant development is crucial. The accessibility of zuranolone could be a concern, as new medications might initially have a higher cost and limited availability, potentially limiting access for some individuals. Zuranolone's interactions with other medications or treatments that postpartum women might be taking should be thoroughly studied to avoid any adverse effects. PPD is a complex condition that can vary greatly between individuals. Finding the right dosage and treatment plan tailored to each woman's needs might require careful consideration. While zuranolone offers a pharmacological approach, it is important not to overlook the benefits of psychosocial interventions, such as therapy and support groups, in the overall treatment plan. Overcoming the stigma associated with PPD and seeking help is a challenge. Some women might be hesitant to use medication due to concerns about judgment or societal perceptions. Healthcare providers need to be adequately educated about zuranolone and its potential benefits and limitations to make informed decisions and provide comprehensive care. Determining the appropriate duration of zuranolone treatment and ensuring a smooth transition to other forms of support after discontinuation are important aspects to address. There remains a need for comprehensive studies that delve deeper into its long-term effects, interactions with other medications, and its impact on diverse populations. Rigorous clinical trials and longitudinal studies can provide invaluable insights into the treatment's efficacy, safety, and potential limitations. The approval of zuranolone could potentially have a broader impact beyond its application in PPD. As researchers and clinicians gain a deeper understanding of its mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, there is a possibility that zuranolone's insights may extend to other mental health conditions.

      "abstract": "Medication and/or psychosocial treatment in childhood do not appear to have an impact on adult outcomes of individuals with ADHD. There is, however, a marked decline in medication adherence in adolescence, which continues into adulthood, with less than 10% of adults with ADHD continuing to use medication. Moreover, psychosocial treatments too often do not continue to be used or adapted to new challenges. Thus, it is difficult to conclude what impact medication and/or psychosocial treatments would have on adult outcomes should these treatments be adhered to and applied continuously. As it stands, the lack of impact from treatments in childhood suggests that ADHD is a chronic condition, and that ongoing regular follow-up may be needed to offer patients interventions (medication and psychosocial treatment) that they require both to improve their symptoms in the short-term and promote more positive long-term outcome.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Restless legs syndrome (RLS) or Ekbom syndrome is characterized by abnormal and unpleasant sensations (paresthesias or dysesthesias) involving the lower extremities that become apparent or worsen at rest, especially in the evening at bedtime, and are relieved, at least transiently, with movement. Sensations often involve both legs but can be unilateral or may alternate between lower extremities. Common complaints include a sensation of creeping, crawling, tingling, wormy, throbbing, pulling, burning, or increased “tension” located deep within the legs (rather than affecting the skin superficially) when sitting or lying down. Some patients are simply unable to describe adequately the sensation they feel. Although symptoms are typically not described as painful, a complaint of pain does not exclude the diagnosis. These uncomfortable sensations extend from the feet and ankle proximally to the legs and, occasionally, thighs. Similar sensations have also been described in the arms. Symptoms tend to occur at night, although unpleasant sensations may emerge during the daytime during prolonged periods of immobility (eg, airplane flights). There is often an accompanying irresistible urge to move the limbs (motor restlessness) to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Less frequently, an isolated urge to move is present without any accompanying unpleasant sensations.",

Nevertheless, it is important to consider the possibility of a depressive disorder when a depressed or irritable mood is more than temporary, occurs in conjunction with other symptoms, or interferes with daily functioning. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is manifested by a depressed or irritable mood or diminished interest or pleasure that lasts for at least 2 weeks. This is accompanied by changes in cognitive and physical functioning. Dysthymic disorder (DD) is a less severe type of depression that involves chronic symptoms and lasts for at least 1 year. These specific types of depressive disorders are the focus of this article.\n\nDepressive disorders can be identified in children of all ages, but they become increasingly prevalent during adolescence. In fact, the peak ages of depressive symptom onset in lifespan studies are 15 to 19 years and 25 to 29 years. The sharpest rise in prevalence occurs among girls during adolescence and early adulthood. Approximately 2% of school-age children and 4% to 6% of adolescents struggle with MDD at any one point in time.

      "title": "Psychological parameters of psoriasis",
      "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory scaling dermatosis. The marked visible appearance of the lesions have a negative impact on body image that leads to decreased self-esteem, hence seriously compromising the patient's quality of life. The clinical picture critically affects the social well-being of the patient since the disease is commonly misunderstood and feared by the social environment as being contagious. The patient feels stigmatized and this further intensifies their lack of self-confidence and self-esteem. Feelings of shame and guilt increase the tendency toward suicidal ideation. The poor quality of life of psoriatic patients has been associated with excessive alcohol consumption, increased smoking and greater use of tranquilizers, sedatives and antidepressants. As far as mental impairment is concerned, a correlation has been found between psychological stress and the clinical severity of symptoms: the more mentally affected the patient, the more severe the dermatologic lesions. Similarly, stressful life events constitute a major risk for the occurrence and recurrence, exacerbating the severity and duration of the symptoms. Depression and anxiety can worsen the disease or cause resistance to treatment or patient's indifference, which in turn can lead to expensive and prolonged treatment. Not least, the disease itself contributes to anxiety, depression and psychological stress, thus creating a \"vicious circle\" that is difficult to manage. Given that women seem to invest more in their personal appearance than men, it is hardly surprising that female psoriatic patients report higher levels of depression. Similarly, the risk of mental disorders is also higher in younger patients for whom body image plays an equally significant role. The severity of the disease, side effects of therapy and mental disorders are among the causes that have been attributed to sexual dysfunction reported by some psoriatic patients. At the social level, stigma, social rejection, feelings of shame, embarrassment and lack of confidence provoked by the disease often lead to the discontinuation of daily activities and social withdrawal. This review attempts to describe the prevalence of psychological stress and its negative social impact on patients with psoriasis. The recognition and treatment of these psychosocial problems may contribute to improving the quality of life for patients and reduce treatment costs. The collaboration between the psychiatrist and the dermatologist is a fundamental prerequisite toward addressing these issues.",

      "title": "Los juicios de control sobre los agentes de salud: variable moduladora de la calidad de vida de los enfermos de cáncer de pulmón avanzado sometidos a tratamiento paliativo",
      "abstract": "Este trabajo de investigacion en Psicoocologia se ubica en el marco amplio de la Psicologia de la Salud y en concreto dentro de la Psicologia del Control. Hoy en dia, se considera que tener control, o simplemente tener sensacion de que se tiene control sobre cualquier situacion es, en muchos casos, beneficioso para la persona. Sin embargo, tambien es cierto que, en determinadas circunstancias, tener control puede producir efectos negativos en el individuo. Por ejemplo, proporcionar control a personas que no lo desean, o que no lo pueden utilizar de manera efectiva es perjudicial ya que puede aumentar los niveles de ansiedad y depresion. Por otro lado, hay situaciones donde el individuo puede querer ejercer el control pero es imposible, por lo que tambien pueden aumentar los problemas emocionales cuando el individuo persiste en el intento de controlar. Ademas, tanto la negacion como un elevado optimismo tambien pueden ser negativos, pues el sujeto puede tener ilusion de control, lo que puede provocar que la persona no siga las pautas para conseguirlo (Shapiro, Schwartz y Astin, 1996). Todas estas posibilidades que ofrece el estudio del control han determinado el desarrollo de multitud de formulaciones teoricas sobre el tema, con mas o menos interrelaciones entre ellas, que se apoyan en un amplio numero de conceptos aparentemente sinonimos pero de dificil integracion. Debido a la gran diversidad teorica que engloba el control, en este estudio pretendemos presentar una propuesta integradora de la Psicologia del Control, donde consideraremos el Locus de Control como un constructo mas. Y dentro de este marco, el papel del Locus de Control de Salud se redefine y no debera contemplarse como una variable predictora de las conductas de salud especificas, sino mas bien como una variable moduladora de los efectos de las demas variables. A partir de aqui, consideramos que un factor primordial para entender el papel del control en la conducta y las emociones, es el grado con el que el sujeto considera que existe control sobre la situacion. Por lo tanto, creemos que el concepto crucial es el Juicio de Control, ya que va a permitir superar las limitaciones que ha conllevado en el campo de la Psicologia de la Salud, por un lado, el uso del constructo Locus de Control, y por otro, los diferentes conceptos relativos al control y aportados por otras teorias. EN el presente trabajo, a partir de la presentacion de los Juicios de Control, se ha elaborado un modelo de Psicologia de Control que intenta incluir otros constructos pertenecientes al campo del control y asi clarificar la gran diversidad teorica que engloba el control. El objetivo principal de este estudio longitudinal es el de averiguar la influencia moduladora de los Juicios de Control en la Calidad de Vida (entendida esta como la valoracion subjetiva que el paciente hace de diferentes aspectos de su vida, en relacion con su estado de salud y evaluada con un instrumento de 32 escalas analogico-visuales denominado CVCP) y la Supervivencia de una muestra de 92 enfermos de cancer de pulmon avanzado sometidos a dos tipos de tratamiento anticanceroso diferentes (Radioterapia o Quimioterapia), para ello se ha elaborado un instrumento especifico para evaluar los Juicios de Control de los Agentes de Salud de los enfermos con cancer de pulmon a partir de una adaptacion del instrumento de Locus de Control desarrollado por Font (1989). En la discusion de este trabajo, planteamos la adecuacion de los instrumentos utilizados, asi como la contrastacion de los planteamientos teoricos con los datos empiricos obtenidos. Y como conclusiones relevantes de este estudio podemos decir, por un lado, que no hemos podido explicar que los Juicios de Control jueguen un importante papel en la Calidad de Vida de estos enfermos, sin embargo, por otro lado, parece que si tienen un papel relevante en la supervivencia pues los sujetos que reciben QT y tienen un Juicio de Control Interno bajo-moderado viven el doble que los que reciben RT y mas de un tercio que los tienen un Juicio de Control Interno alto (independientemente de que reciban QT o RT).",

A long-held, erroneous belief that ME/CFS is not a physiological illness has persisted among some clinicians, leading to the denial of a patient's physical illness and attributing the symptoms to other causes. The debilitating effects of ME/CFS in the pediatric population can affect all aspects of academic, social, emotional, and physical development. ME/CFS has been diagnosed in children younger than 10 years. Therefore, the school nurse is likely to encounter one or more students in the various stages of this disease, putting the school nurse in a position to ameliorate the impact of this potentially devastating chronic condition.",

      "title": "AMA Hearing Loss/Tinnitus Guidelines",
      "abstract": "Figure.The Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, now in its sixth edition, presents the most comprehensive system of assessing impairment, utilizing many of the application designs established by the World Health Organization (WHO). Upgrades in the current edition center on clinical expertise and methodologies that improve consistency, precision, standardization, and repeatability.Figure.: Dennis A. Colucci, AuD, MAThis system considers diagnosis, functional symptomatology, physical findings, and epidemiology and clinical studies as the bases for assessment, allowing for standardization across modalities and organ systems, and for rating decisions to be more uniform across patients. HEARING LOSS DOESN'T STAND ALONE People with hearing loss are at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating activities of daily living, especially when patients are older and have other sensory or motor comorbidities. Each physical or mental challenge adds a layer of impairment to the whole person. For example, adding a cognitive disability or a psychological condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation to hearing loss would increase the whole person impairment (WPI). A patient with hearing loss and tinnitus has ratings for each, with the possibility of additional ratings from the mental and behavioral domains for debilitating tinnitus, hyperacusis, or misophonia. To the clinician, hearing loss does not stand alone in the overall health of a person and should be weighed against all factors that affect engagement or isolation because auditory training and neuroplasticity maintenance are daily activities. Understanding the workings of the WPI system is useful for rating how the impairment affects quality of life and, specifically, activities of daily living. This approach is helpful from a number of standpoints, both clinical and legal. The percentage of WPI varies across systems. For example, the functional loss of an eye converts to 16 percent WPI, and the loss of one ear's function is 7 percent WPI. Bilateral profound deafness is rated at 35 percent WPI, while 95 percent vision loss is 100 percent WPI. In the last case, vision loss is considered more of an impairment because it reduces daily functionality, visual mobility, and reading, and requires significant accommodations. Deafness does not prevent mobility or the ability to take care of oneself. For binaural hearing loss WPI, the calculations, originally developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO–HNS) for a moderate hearing loss, work like this: First, calculate the monaural impairment: Pure-tone average (PTA) = [(0.5 kHz + 1 kHz + 2 kHz + 3 kHz)/4] = dB HL Then, deduct the first 25 dB of loss, and multiply the remainder by 1.5 percent: (dB HL – 25 dB) x 1.5% = impairment For example, if right-ear values are 45, 50, 50, and 55, respectively, right-ear impairment is: (45 + 50 + 50 + 55)/4 = 50 50 – 25 = 25 25 x 1.5% = 37.5% If left-ear values are 40 for all frequencies, left-ear impairment is: (40 + 40 + 40 + 40)/4 = 40 40 – 25 = 15 15 x 1.5% = 22.5% Second, calculate binaural impairment: [5(Better Ear) + Worse Ear]/6 [(5 x 22.5) + 37.5]/6 = 25% Finally, see Table 11-3 of the Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment and select the rating for 25 percent binaural impairment or 9 percent WPI. PROVIDE APPROPRIATE PRESCRIPTIONS The guide is not designed to establish work eligibility, restrict someone from performing a desired skill, or deny access, but rather as an index to set forth a diagnosis and percentage of physical or functional loss, establish permanent loss, and provide a hierarchy of classification for long-term conditions. The taxonomy of classifying impairments such as vertigo is broken into five severity classes based on history, physical examination, and diagnostic or objective findings, with Class 0 signifying minimal impairment and Class 4 the most severe. The fact that hearing loss was recently qualified as a risk factor for accelerating brain aging by reducing brain volume and cognitive abilities increases the importance of hearing loss to the medical professions. Since all advanced hearing technologies essentially have the same outcomes, providing appropriate prescriptive and verification/validation measures is mandatory for every audiologist. As hearing changes, so do communication ability, cognitive function, and psychological factors of depression and disorientation, affecting quality of life and the whole person, not just hearing.",

These stressful experiences in early life may permanently alter brain physiology and lead to long-lasting physiological, psychological, and behavioral changes. Early stress may have lifelong adverse effects on growth, development, health, behavior, learning, and memory.

      "title": "[Clinical practice guideline. Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of learning disabilities",
      "abstract": "Learning disabilities are a heterogeneous diagnostic category. As a specific disorder learning disabilities include reading disorders, disorders of written expression and mathematics disorders. As a general concept, learning disabilities may be categorised into four symptom complexes, which are not mutually exclusive: 1. dyslexia, 2. motor-perceptual; 3. language delay; 4. hyperactivity. In clinical settings these neurodevelopmental disorders are diagnosed in school-aged children. The most common referral reasons are significant difficulties in school achievement or difficulties in child adjustment and functioning that are manifested through behavioural and emotional difficulties caused by learning disabilities. Since academic achievement is an important aspect of self-esteem in childhood, school failure may result in many short-term and long-term consequences for the child’s functioning in narrow and broader social contexts, development of maladaptive behaviour and also cause the development of psychopathology. The most common short-term consequences include low academic and general self-esteem, lack of motivation for schooling and related obligations, behavioural disorders, a sense of overload in the child, peer relationship problems and a heightened level of family conflicts. The usual long-term outcomes are psychosomatic problems, affective disorders (depression, anxiety) and severe behavioural problems. Furthermore, longitudinal studies show the persistence of certain problems in adulthood.In summary, impairments should be adequately assessed to evaluate the cognitive deficits and strengths, and a precise diagnosis should be established. Once problem areas have been identified, special teaching strategies can be devised in collaboration with the school to circumvent handicaps. Also, an important part of intervention includes counselling of parents and children.",

      "title": "Prolonged cardiac activation, stressful events and worry in daily life",
      "abstract": "De relatie tussen psychosociale stress en hart- en vaatziekten is intensief onderzocht. In de afgelopen decennia was het ‘reactivity model’ het belangrijkste theoretische uitgangspunt in de meeste onderzoeken. In dit model wordt verondersteld dat een heftige reactie van hart- en vaatstelsel tijdens stress een risicofactor zou zijn voor het ontwikkelen van hart- en vaatziekten. Hoewel het ‘reactivity model’ in het dieronderzoek veelbelovende resultaten boekte, ondervond vanwege resultaten uit humaan onderzoek een aantal fundamentele kritieken. Het brandpunt ligt bij momenten waarop een stressvolle gebeurtenis plaatsvindt, terwijl de periode daarvoor of daarna over het hoofd wordt gezien. Stressoren zijn gewoonlijk kort van duur en doen zich bij de meeste mensen niet frequent genoeg voor om consequenties voor de gezondheid te hebben. Deze factoren kunnen dus niet verklaren waarom chronische veranderingen in de balans van het hart- en vaatsysteem optreden. Een alternatief model dat wij voorstellen in dit proefschrift - het ‘prolonged activation model’- gaat er vanuit dat stressoren alleen kunnen leiden tot hart- en vaatziekten als ze in staat zijn verlengde fysiologische effecten te veroorzaken. \nDaarnaast is het onduidelijk waarom sommige stressoren wel verlengde effecten tot gevolg hebben en anderen niet. Tot nu toe verklaart het ‘perseverative cognition model’, als enige waarom sommige stressoren leiden tot verlengde effecten en anderen niet. Perseveratieve cognitie is het voortdurend denken aan negatieve gebeurtenissen en omvat fenomenen zoals piekeren of zich zorgen maken. Perseveratieve cognitie zorgt voor het ‘vers’ houden van het mentale beeld van een stressor alsmede de negatieve fysiologische effecten ervan, of deze stressor nu wel of niet plaatsvindt. Daarom bestaat een groot deel van dit proefschrift uit onderzoek naar de effecten van perseveratieve cognitie op hartactiviteit.\n\n\n\nWe concluderen dat de resultaten van dit proefschrift aangeven dat perseveratieve cognitie, een belangrijke factor is in het ‘prolonged activation model’. Het verklaart niet alle verlengde effecten van stressoren, maar heeft daarentegen zelf een verlengd fysiologisch effect, dat zelfs langer lijkt dan dat van stressoren. Deze vondst en de effecten van 'piekergeneigdheid' op hartactiviteit gedurende de slaap suggereren dat onderzoek in de toekomst gericht zou moeten worden op de rol van onbewuste perseveratieve cognitie.",

      "title": "Psychiatric conditions",
      "abstract": "In reviewing psychiatric syndromes, some themes recur. This does not lead to a general theory of disorder, but to an analysis that has some general features. Set against a developmental background, disorder is viewed in relation to the tasks that must be achieved where multiple sets of mental rules are possible. These include the monitoring of internal and interpersonal rules, the maintenance of the individual's experience of continuity in the presence of multiple states of mind, and the capacity to understand the mental states and actions of others. Many of the overarching, metarepresentational functions could also be characterized as functions of the self, and these appear to be disrupted in conditions that are as widely different as schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. In schizophrenia the monitoring of the individual's own thoughts or actions may be impaired, whilst in borderline functioning the continuity of states of mind is undermined. If the sense of self is derived from the awareness of being the author of one's own actions or thoughts over time, then in these conditions it is undermined in different ways. Inasmuch as the coherence of the self is in turn central to action, disturbances of action are the result of these different forms of disruption of the self.In both condition, further contrasting factors may undermine action. In schizophrenia inefficient information processing may lead either to action based on incidental aspects of a situation, or to inaction based on information overload. In borderline personality disorder experiences in which action has been impossible may lead to action turned on itself, in self injury. However, in both, there may be elements that represent the attempt to preserve action in the face of such threats. In schizophrenia delusions and hallucinations may in part be compensatory mechanisms that reduce uncertainty, hence providing the basis for action. In borderline personality disorder the splitting of mental representations may similarly, by excluding elements that are incompatible with action, provide (partial) representations that provide the basis for action. Thus in both conditions elements of accurate representation are sacrificed, in order for action to continue.Conditions in which action is preserved may be contrasted with those, such as depression, where it is not. In either case a range of intentional and non-intentional origins may be envisaged. In situations of helplessness depression may be seen to be an appropriate and accurate representation that action is not possible. Depression seen in the absence of such threat may result from the intrusion of cognitive and emotional states that undermine action arising from a physical, non-intentional interruption of perceptions, thoughts, feelings, or actions. Equally depression may arise where mental representations that have been maintained inactive or out of consciousness are activated, and are incompatible with action.We conclude by revisiting our starting point. Mental entities, perceptions, feelings, thoughts, and wishes are genuinely causal and must provide sufficient certainty that the individual can act effectively. Throughout biology, intentional states of organisms, from the simplest cellular creatures to non-human primates, have provided the basis for action, and in general the certainty has been derived from the evolution of those intentional states over long periods of time. In this and the preceding chapters we have seen how, in the activities of the human mind there is an infinite elaboration of the potential inherent in all intentional processes in biology. This has introduced novelty, creativity, and flexibility, that are seen in the achievements of language, custom, technology, and culture. It has also increased the risks of uncertainty, confusion, and the undermining of action. These are reduced through an interplay between the sophisticated integrative capacities of the human brain and the continuities of human relationships, skills, beliefs, and social organizations. Disorder is found in the failure of intentional states to underpin action, where these are undermined by the external world, or where intentional states are distorted, contradictory or unintegrated, and where action is undermined or ineffective.",

      "title": "The threshold problem of impairment criteria in psychiatric diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Psychiatric diagnoses are made based on careful ascertainment of cluster of signs and symptoms. However, just having symptoms and signs is not sufficient, these need to create problems to the person (or others around him/her) and manifest as distress or functional impairment. For example, a person may have third-person-discussing-type auditory hallucinations for over a month, but he or she may be able to attend to most social occasions and conduct the occupation as an agriculturist diligently. Similarly, individuals may present with symptoms of cannabis use disorder, but not manifest impairment of substance use disorder.[1] We argue that there is considerable heterogeneity in the conceptualization, practical ascertainment, and interpretation of functional impairment. This results in, at least to some degree, nebulousness of determining the threshold of psychiatric disorders.[2] Determining a threshold has implications in adjudicating the prevalence of psychiatric disorder, whether a psychiatric disorder is in remission, and whether a person needs treatment. We envisage three main reasons contributing to the threshold of psychiatric diagnosis. The first is the individual context of the person being interviewed for a diagnosis. A pilot experiencing sleep difficulties due to anxiety and missing a day of flight would be considered to have a diagnosis, whereas a college student missing a class in a month might not be considered passing the diagnosis threshold. The second is the social and cultural context of the person being evaluated. A person from rural parts of Punjab in India being extremely jocular and interrupting the therapist occasionally may be passed off as nonimpairing. A similar presentation of an individual from rural Tamil Nadu may be considered manifesting impairment associated with an affective illness. The third factor is the experience and expectations of the therapist. The therapist decides whether a person crosses the threshold or not. This may have something to do with how they appraise the information and what clinico-therapeutic experiences they may have had in the past. Since there is heterogeneity in determining the threshold of psychiatric diagnoses, there are a few suggestions to address the issue. One is acceptance of the subjectivity of the process of determining the threshold of diagnosis. One could determine kappa values of interrater reliability of impairment criteria. Interrater reliability of diagnoses and functional impairment assessment has been found to be acceptable, though not completely concordant.[3] The second approach could be greater recognition of contextual aspect in determining diagnosis and addition of an explanatory note on how social, educational, economic, political, legal, and other factors might have influenced determining threshold in a particular case. The third approach could be to put a-priori note during diagnostic evaluation process, when the diagnosis is being made and about in what circumstances or degree of functional impairment would the mental health professional not consider a psychiatric diagnosis or the diagnosis to be deemed to be in remission. To conclude, we do proffer that subjectivity exists in determining the lower threshold of impairment of psychiatric disorders, and being cognizant of this may help in rationally labeling an individual as having psychiatric disorder.

      "title": "SP0030 Reasons for delay in help seeking at the onset of symptoms",
      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Early intervention following the onset of chronic illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and Sjogren's syndrome can improve disease prognosis, reduce illness related disability and improve patient quality of life. Therefore, it is vital that the time between symptom onset and treatment is short, however, many patients experience long delays. The period of time between an individual's first detection of a bodily change and the first consultation with a healthcare professional is known as patient delay, while the time between first consultation and been referred to a rheumatologist for treatment is known as healthcare professional delay. Patient delay can be attributed to a range of barrier to consultation, these include contextual barriers (e.g. geographical location, financial barriers and availability of health services), individual barriers (e.g. demographic characteristics and health literacy) the nature of symptom onset (e.g. intermittent symptoms or the experience of a symptoms commonly associated with many conditions such as fatigue) and psychological barriers (e.g. perceptions of illness, the normalising symptoms interpretation of symptoms and fear and worries about wasting the doctor's time). Many interventions to reduce patient delay focus on educating the public about the typical symptoms associated with a specific illnesses in the hope that greater awareness will lead to better recognition of early symptoms. These interventions are based on the premise that the general public may hold misrepresentative stereotypes of what it is like to experience an illness or may even have no stereotypical belief (also known as a prototypical belief) to compare their current symptoms to. There is very little evidence about the evolution of early symptoms over time and how patients appraise these early symptoms and then decide to seek help. Furthermore, the non-specific nature of early symptoms for many rheumatological conditions can also be a significant barrier to patients recognising that symptoms are indicative of a chronic illness. For example, patients may attribute symptoms to stress, ageing or a temporary condition and actively choose not to seek help. Therefore, we must explore patients beliefs about symptom experience and not just focus on their beliefs about specific illnesses. Understanding early symptom presentation and the way that early symptoms are interpreted by patient is important for the development of robust help seeking interventions. However, interventions to promote prompt help-seeking based on symptom presentation must also take in to account for contextual, individual and psychological barriers which may interact with individual perceptions of early symptoms. Understanding the factors which lead to patient delays and healthcare professional delays across rheumatological conditions can ensure that interventions to reduce delay are developed using a robust evidence base. Evidence based interventions such be multifaceted and may include the development of public health information (e.g posters, tv campaigns etc), the development of robust online information and challenging mis-information online, addressing health inequalities which may lead to delay (e.g. increasing the accessibility of health services and promoting health literacy in hard-to-reach communities) and developing educational information for healthcare professionals. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared",

Une des raisons est probablement la confusion sur ce qui peut être attribué à l’âge ou aux effets de l’alcool. De plus, ces derniers imitent certains symptômes d’autres maladies et troubles, par exemple les troubles anxieux, la dépression ou la démence. La plupart des outils de dépistage sont insuffisamment adaptés aux personnes âgées et l’estimation de l’abus d’alcool chez celles-ci varie largement selon les méthodes utilisées. La vieillesse devient également un facteur de fragilisation face à la consommation d’alcool surtout si la personne âgée présente des problèmes de santé. Les alcoolisations sont souvent une réponse à la solitude, à l’isolement ou à la perte de soutien social et à l’anxiété, à la dépression et au stress. L’efficacité des interventions brèves dans le cas d’abus d’alcool chez les adultes âgés a été soulignée par ses résultats. L’approche clinique cognitive sur les addictions met l’accent sur l’importance des croyances concernant le produit d’alcoolisation. Certaines trouvent leur source dans l’âge de la personne.",

Zdravstveni rizici se manifestiraju stetnim i neugodnim djelovanjem na vid, opterecenost misicno-kostanog sustava, psihickim smetnjama vezanim uz stres i umor. Među najcescim smetnjama kod rada na racunalima jesu smetnje vida. Istraživanja su pokazala da se smetnje manifestiraju u obliku naprezanja i umora ociju, ocni kapci se tesko otvaraju i zatvaraju, iritacija, suhoca i pecenje konjunktiva, subjektivni osjecaj “pijeska” u ocima, bol ociju, praceni glavoboljom, mucninom (astenopija), te raznim psihickim i psiholoskim reakcijama. Napor ociju vezan je i uz razne subjektivne faktore kao sto su opci umor, upotreba lijekova, bolest, sklonost migreni, osjetljivost na svjetlo te nervoza i nemir. Svi ti faktori mogu pojacati simptome vidnog napora, no glavni uzroci vidnog napora su bljestanje, kontrastno bljestanje, titranje i svjetlucanje slike na ekranu, reflektiranja te okolnih radnih uvjeta. Prema provedenim ispitivanjima (Kalifornijsko sveuciliste, L.A.) 50% osoba koje rade na racunalu najmanje 4 sata na dan ima problema s ocima. Dokazano je da žene pate od vidnog napora dvostruko vise od muskaraca. Kod rada na kompjutorima oni koji vec imaju smetnje vida imaju vecu vjerojatnost razvoja vidnih napora. Osobe s kataraktom, nistagmusom, glaukomom ne bi se trebale profesionalno baviti radom na racunalima. Tegobe se smanjuju da cesce i nakratko prekidamo gledanje u ekran. Korisno je krace vrijeme brzo treptati, te zatim nekoliko sekundi držati zatvorene oci. Gledati udaljene predmete tridesetak sekundi. Oci prekriti dlanovima oko jedne minute. Visesatnim radom na racunalom treptaji vjeđa postaju sve rjeđi, pa se događa da oci ostaju suhe jer ih vlaži sve manje suza. Umjetne suze kupljene u ljekarni mogu ucinkovito rijesiti ovaj problem.",

      "title": "An Unsound Mind in an Unsound Body: Bodily Manifestations of Mental Distress in Women’s Madness Narratives",
      "abstract": "Madness has traditionally been seen as an illness of the mind, or even, more romantically, sickness of the soul. Contemporary biomedical approach views it as a brain disease caused by chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters. Its symptoms are also associated with mental activity such as perceptions, cognition, emotions and moods. Nevertheless, much of the impact of the so-called mental illness is voiced through the body. First of all, mental distress is often communicated in a myriad of bodily pains. Most common psychosomatic complaints include dizziness, headaches, backaches, skin problems, indigestion and fatigue. Then, many mentally ill have problems accepting and respecting their body functions, especially problematic are sexual needs, menstruation and eating. It is manifested either in fear of sexuality or, its opposite, compulsive promiscuity. A similar black-and- white attitude concerns food, which is either completely denied to the body in anorexia or abused in bulimic binging. The 'sick' attitude to the body parodies the paradoxes innate in Western culture, which splits the human being into binary opposites of flesh and soul. The aim of my chapter is to look at bodily manifestations of mental illness as recorded in women's madness narratives. I analyse the body image presented in them as well as the body-mind dichotomy the authors often experience. The texts I focus on include Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation, Marya Hornbacher's Wasted and Kate Grenville's Lilian's Story.",

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "abstract": "The main characteristics of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are airflow limitation, chronic intermittent hypoxia, or apnea; which may lead to tissue hypoperfusion and recurrent arousal from sleep. These episodes of hypoxia or apnea can lead to tissue inflammation, and are causal factors of disturbed sleep in both men and women. Several lines of evidence suggest that sleep patterns differ along the lifespan in both male and female subjects, and this may result from the influence of female gonadotropic hormones on sleep. Compared to men, women have more sleep complaints, as women's sleep is not only influenced by gonadotropins, but also by conditions related to these hormones, such as pregnancy. It is therefore not surprising that sleep disturbances are seen during menopause, too. Factors that may play a role in this type of SDB in women include vasomotor symptoms, changing reproductive hormone levels, circadian rhythm abnormalities, mood disorders, coexistent medical conditions, and lifestyle factors.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

Bipolar disorder is characterized by intermittent episodes of mania or hypomania and depressive episodes; rapid cycling, mixed states, and psychotic symptoms occur in some cases. Depression is a serious mental disorder that manifests with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration. Mania is the opposite of depression; it is a state of abnormally elevated or irritable mood, arousal, and/or energy levels. Depression and mania are thought to be heterogeneous illnesses that can result from dysfunction of several neurotransmitter or metabolic systems.",

Os disturbios comportamentais de caes associados a separacao ocorrem na ausencia total ou parcial do dono. Os sinais clinicos comuns que afetam os caes com ansiedade por separacao, sao a vocalizacao, eliminacao (fezes ou urina), comportamento destrutivo e agressivo. Estes problemas tem importância na veterinaria devido as queixas dos proprietarios relacionada a seus caes. Os tratamentos requerem do proprietario uma dedicacao e tempo, pois necessita de educacao do cliente, modificacao do comportamento do cao, terapia com farmacos ansioliticos, mudanca do ambiente ou ate a combinacao destes. Nem todos os disturbios comportamentais podem ser eliminados, porem o tratamento tem resultados satisfatorios e nenhum dos caes submetidos ao tratamento piorou. O diagnostico e estabelecido pela anamnese, relato dos proprietarios, filmagens, observacao do cao e exames laboratoriais, como um hemograma completo, urinalise e urocultura para descartar outros problemas que nao tenham relacao com a SAS. O prognostico e o sucesso do tratamento dependem muito do desempenho do proprietario em seguir as orientacoes do (a) Medico (a) Veterinario (a). Ha necessidade de novos estudos para avaliar a SAS em caes. Cabe aos (as) Medicos (as) Veterinarios (as), conhecer os comportamentos fisiologicos destes caes e orientar os proprietarios sobre a posse responsavel de animais e possiveis comportamentos que estes possam manifestar, evitando transtornos futuros.

Scientists include psychological problems related to the development of human intelligence. Intelligence plays a significant role not only in its daily activities, but also in the professional field. Scientists have proved the fact that the success of any activity, the adaptation of a person to the conditions of life, a certain environment, etc., depends on the level of intelligence. Changes in the development of personality intelligence can also be reflected in one’s mental health. One way to solve a person’s psychological problems is to ignore them or to soften the general state of the body. The modern world is posing more and more challenges to humanity, so today psychological science must be ready to solve various psychological problems, and this is possible only through their detailed research.",

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with excessive, unrealistic anxiety that lasts six or more months. These patients experience trembling, muscle aches, insomnia, bowel movement upsets, dizziness, and irritability. Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with extreme anxiety about being judged by others or having extreme anxiety about behaving in a way that might cause embarrassment or ridicule. Anxiety disorders are treated as follows: psychosocial therapies; medications; and both psychosocial therapies and medications. The three main types of depressive disorders can occur with any of the major anxiety disorders: major depression; dysthymia/chronic depression; and bipolar disorder.

Depression is common and serious problem that often starts in childhood. Today is estimated that approximatly 10-15% of children in general population has syptoms of depression. It is associated with an increased risk of other psychiatric disorders, poor academic success, underdeveloped social skills and even suicidal thoughts. The primary symptoms of depression are continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness and mood changes. Symptoms of depression in children also include irritability or anger, social withdrawal, changes in appetite (either increased or decreased), changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep), difficulty concentrating, etc. Depressive disorders include Major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder, indeterminate and bipolar disorder. Depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Depression should be recognized and diagnosed as early as possible in children and adolescents in order to start treatment on time. The most efficient treatment is a treatment that is not focused on depressive symptoms only, but also on functioning on daily bases in children.",

      "abstract": "SummaryThe amount of tension in the muscular skeleton system is dependent on personality, physical constitution, longlasting recurrent or actual psychosomatic problems and learned behavior. Muscular tension becomes a coping mechanism to deal with somato-psychical and social difficulties. The literature shows possible biochemical correlations with states of depression, and also an impaired serotonin metabolism. However, not all patients suffer from depression. Further, a depressive, depressive-hypochondric state, and/or state of anxiety can be a consequence of fibromyalgia pain. Impaired non-REM sleep and a disturbed system of pain-modulation in the middle brain and brain stem, and a decreased tolerance of frustration, as well as frustrated aggression are assumed to be responsible for muscle contraction.In about 90% of the patients with fibromyalgia, psychoneuroses of different kinds have been found in which an impaired self- as well as an insufficient body awareness (partly as a consequence of the lasting pain) nearly always play a role. There are also significantly more life events and more problems compared to patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Four different strategies exist for therapy: 1) administration of antidepressive drugs; 2) relaxation: a) using drug therapy with benzodiazepines or meprobamate; b) with passive or, preferably, active physical therapy, resulting in physical strengthening, and leading also to an improved self-confidence c) autogenic training. 3) antirheumatic drug (for pain relief); 4) cognitive psychotherapy, individual and/or group, with the aim of cognitive reorientation, and fostering adequate strategies to cope with pain and problems.",

      "title": "Child abuse and neglect: psychiatric and neuro-biological consequences",
      "abstract": "Child abuse and neglect is a common problem that is potentially damaging to long-term physical and psychological health of children. Over the past, researchers have documented this relationship and have identified two possible mechanisms that can explain the increased incidence of childhood stress and consequent adult somatic disease: the increased incidence of health harming behaviors and causes epigenetic and other changes that predispose individuals to disease through a raised non-specific inflammatory profile [1]. Abuse survivors, as well as persons who have experienced other types of childhood adversities, are more likely to participate in high-risk behaviors [2]. Possible etiologic factors in survivors' health problems include abuse-related alterations in brain functioning that can increase vulnerability to stress and decrease immune function. Adult survivors are also more likely to participate in risky behaviors that undermine health or to have cognitions and beliefs that amplify health problems [2].\r\n\r\nChildhood abuse and early life stress may become hard-coded into the genome, creating an epigenetic memory of events that leads to impaired health at a later date [3].\r\n\r\nChronic early life stress results in long-term changes in HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis function and regulation typified by hypersecretion of CRH and ACTH. The initial hypersecretion of cortisol may over time lead to blunting of the cortisol response to CRH and ACTH and relative glucocorticoid resistance. A decrease in glucocorticoid levels or impaired glucocorticoid receptor function might then lead to increased stress responsiveness [2].\r\n\r\nChildhood abuse and neglect is also associated with reduced adult hippocampal volume, particularly on the left side, and these findings support the hypothesis that exposure to early stress in humans, as in other animals, affects hippocampal subfield development [4].\r\n\r\nAnother recent study demonstrate that children who experienced two or more types of violence exposure showed significantly accelerated telomere erosion from age-5 baseline to age-10 follow-up measurement compared with children who had one type of violence exposure or who were not exposed to violence [5].\r\n\r\nPeople experience and interpret physical and emotional insults in diverse ways and many contextual factors affect the phenomenology of abuse and neglect, and in Italy there are many children victims of various types of maltreatment particularly within their own families. But we must not forget the most vulnerable children who may have even more serious consequences: those who live in foster care [6] or abandoned babies [7] that are actually little-known but that equally needs of social interventions, health and human rights.",

Socioeconomic factors are important determinants of disability, although this aspect of disability in chronic pain disorders is often ignored. Lower socioeconomic status has been shown to be associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of disability, and the rate of progression to disability in patients with chronic pain. Work disability in lower socioeconomic groups is associated with issues of physical work demands and work flexibility (ie, the ability to control the pace of work, take unscheduled breaks or engage in modified work). Workplace interventions, particularly in the subacute phase, that are geared to workers′ limitations offer the best opportunity to reduce the current burden of disability. Where such work modifications are not available, disability will be problematic.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Primary Sjögren9s syndrome (pSS) is the second most common systemic autoimmune disease, with a female-male ratio of 9:1, and characterized by sicca symptoms of the eyes and mouth, including joint pains and multi-system involvement. pSS affects patients9 health-related quality of life (QoL), mental status and relationships with family. In pSS patients, symptoms such as fatigue, depression, arthralgia, fibromyalgia and general loss of well-being are commonly reported. Among them, fatigue is the most common problem that includes physical and mental fatigue, it can be as disabling as pain, which is difficult to manage and has a notable impact on QoL. Fatigue is a tiredness which may be mental, physical, or both, and that results in an inability to function at normal performance levels. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of fatigue remain unclear. A number of studies have reported the association of fatigue with Primary Sjögren9s syndrome (pSS), whereas, because of the small sample size of pSS patients, we still lack large sample studies to find the relationship between pSS and fatigue. <h3>Objectives</h3> To investigate the relationship of fatigue severity to other clinical features in primary Sjögren9s syndrome (pSS) and to identify factors contributing to the physical and mental aspects of fatigue in Chinese patients. <h3>Methods</h3> Sixty-seven consecutive patients with PSS according to the American-European Consensus group (AEGG) criteria were included. Demographic, clinical and biological characteristics for all patients were collected. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Profile of Fatigue (ProF), Visual analogue scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), OHIP-14 Scale, MDADI Scale and PSQI Scale were adopted to assess fatigue, depression, anxiety, xerostomia, xerophthalmia and sleep disturbances. Associations with fatigue were compared using multivariate regression. <h3>Results</h3> 94% of our patients were women. The mean age of patients was 51.13±13.23 years, and the mean disease duration was 4.12±4.49 years. The mean oral dryness was 51±17.82, and the mean ocular dryness was 33.56±26.3. Abnormal fatigue, defined as an FSS score &gt;or=4, was present in 64% of the patients. Dry symptoms, low educational level, Pain and depression had a negative impact on fatigue scores. The regression models explained that Pain and depression were the strongest predictors of fatigue according to the FSS. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Fatigue is a tiredness which may be mental, physical, or both, and that results in an inability to function at normal performance levels. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of fatigue remain unclear. From our study, we found that psychosocial variables are determinants of fatigue, and fatigue is associated with depression, but depression is not the primary cause of fatigue in primary SS. Therefore, the investigation of the pathophysiologic correlates of physical and mental aspects of fatigue is needed to guide the development of more effective interventions. <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81401124);the Collaborative Innovation Program of Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University; College graduate research and innovation of Jiangsu Province (KYZZ16–0358, KYZZ15–0353). <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

Most of us experience periods of sadness or grief after losses or disappointments in life, and some of us know what it is like to be unhappy for months, or even years at a time.

Unfortunately, the broad concept used in contemporary psychiatry fails to answer this question and to distinguish between normal unhappiness, an experience not uncommon in everyday life, and the paralyzing disorder that is clinical depression.",

Solitary confinement and prolonged sleep deprivation are just two examples of these psychological torture methods.

      "abstract": "Summary Twelve psychotic reactions are reported in 11 patients with various somatic illnesses treated with ACTH and/or cortisone. Two major patterns occurred: (a) A primarily affective disorder, either manic or depressive; and, more frequently, (b) an organic reaction (toxic psychosis) with associated paranoid-hallucinatory and/or affective (usually depressive) components. No consistent correlation could be obtained with regard to drug dosage and onset, duration, or type of psychosis. Suicidal tendencies were present in several cases. After the ACTH or cortisone was discontinued, termination of the psychosis occurred spontaneously in the organic reactions. The affective disorders required electroconvulsive therapy. A comparison is made between these states and psychoses appearing in naturally occurring hyperadrenalism or Cushing's syndrome. The following factors involved in the production of these psychotic reactions are considered significant: The physiological effects of the hyperadrenal state on the central nervous system. The influence of the underlying disease process. The premorbid personality. Only in a few cases were recognizable psychotic trends present before treatment. It is felt that in most instances the previous personality pattern determined the psychological content of the psychosis, but not its onset. A complete understanding of the interrelationships of all of these physiological and psychological mechanisms is not possible at the present time.",

      "title": "Drug treatments for schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

Most short-term treatment-related side effects of SSRIs are transient and disappear after a few days or weeks. However, following long-term treatment with the SSRIs, some serious adverse events may occur. Some of them can be difficult to recognise because they can resemble residual symptoms of depression. The most serious can be life threatening. They all have a negative influence on the patient’s quality of life and are frequently a prime reason for a lack of long-term compliance with the associated increased risk of recurrence of a depressive episode. This article is an overview of the more common adverse events, which are seen with non-acute treatment with the SSRIs.",

If the fatigue lasts for more than 6 months, it fulfills the definition of \"chronic.\" The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has established specific criteria for the diagnosis of CFS. This is characterized by a persistent or relapsing debilitating fatigue for at least 6 months in the absence of a medical diagnosis that would otherwise explain the clinical presentation. CFS represents a heterogeneous group of patients that manifest symptom complexes with varying degrees of fatigue, limited exertional reserve and cognitive dysfunction. This treatise explores the pathogenesis of CFS as it relates to a complex multidimensional systemic process and offers a hypothesis for the disease processes. In particular, an up-regulated immune system, affecting mitochondrial dysfunction is described. These pathophysiologic mechanisms impact and in turn are being impacted by the neuroendocrine system and the HPA axis. In addition, the cardiovascular system involving blood pressure and heart rate anomalies along with neurocognitive pathology is characterized.",

(4) Drug interactions with clinical consequences usually involve combinations of an SSRI with other psychotropics, especially monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and tricyclic antidepressants, clozapine, lithium, methadone, etc. (5) The clinical consequences of drug interactions with SSRI are either due to overdosing of the drug combined, or to a serotonin syndrome with neuromuscular and vegetative (autonomic) symptoms. (6) Interactions with a number of other drugs have been reported, especially carbamazepine, phenytoin and oral anticoagulants, with a risk of overdose of these drugs.

The average time of occurrence of psychotic symptoms in our 3 cases after beginning of MAP abuse was two or three years. 2.) Although the psychotic states (often schizophrenia-like) were stable for a short time, the symptoms recurred promptly after reinjection of a small amount of MAP, unspecific stress or drinking sake (flashback phenomenon). The recurrence may happen even after several years. 3.) In cases of chronic MAP-P disturbances of consciousness are rare. Chronic process of MAP-P cases may show acute transient disturbances of consciousness (flashback phenomenon). 4.) The change of affects and behaviour ranges between irritable and indifferent attitudes. While there are close connections between the disturbance of feeling and change of personality (Wesensänderung), it is very difficult to decide whether premorbid character traits are dominant or there is a change of personality or emotional disturbance. 5.) About acute psychic symptoms which are responsible for recurrence of MAP-P, MAP-abusers make the experience that their intimate personal affairs are overlooked and become public (uncovered defensive experiences). In chronic cases of MAP-P we often meet patients with hypertrophic self-feeling or delusion of grandeur predominant in the symptomatology. 6.) In our cases sensations were amalgamated into each other and there were hallucinatory experiences without clear division between them. 7.) In chronic cases the auditory hallucinations criticized or censured the patients for their behaviour. Thought echoing (Gedankenlautwerden) was found.

La migrana se define como un dolor de cabeza primario con ataques que duran de 4 a 72 horas y se caracteriza por un dolor pulsatil unilateral de intensidad moderada a severa agravada por la actividad fisica de rutina y asociada con nauseas, fotofobia y / o fonofobia. Ambas patologias, presenta una comorbilidad de alrededor del 70%, son deshabilitantes y afectan a todas las areas de la vida, incluido el funcionamiento social y ocupacional. Tanto en migrana como en TTM juegan un papel muy importante los factores psicologicos, que ha sido ampliamente descritos en la literatura, tales como ansiedad, depresion, somatizacion e incluso algunos rasgos de personalidad. Por tanto, es muy relevante en el diagnostico el eje II o biopsicosocial del individuo para su estudio y como parte de la enfermedad. Al evaluar todos los factores que contribuyen a la enfermedad, en lugar de dar primacia a los factores biologicos por si solos, un modelo biopsicosocial permitiria explicar por que algunos individuos experimentan como condiciones de enfermedad lo que otros consideran simplemente como problemas de la vida. Aunque existen numerosos estudios sobre como afectan los factores psicologicos a las migranas y al TTM, hay pocos precedentes que estudien ambas patologias de forma conjunta, a pesar de su comorbilidad. Ademas, aunque si se describe, no se suele tener en cuenta y se controla la presencia de migrana en los estudios sobre TTM, y la presencia de TTM en los estudios sobre migrana.

Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

إيجابي للتکيف مع الواقع ومتطلباته .. وتکمن المشکلة عند زيادة کمية القلق أو استمراره فترة طويلة .. وهنا يعتبر القلق مرضا واضطرابا .. لأنه يعطل الإنسان ويرهقه ويجعل حياته اليومية مؤلمة ومزعجة .. ويجعل أعصابه مشدودة ومتوترة ..کما أن الإحساس بالقلق والترقب فترة طويلة يؤدي إلى المزاج السيئ والإرهاق واستنزاف الطاقة ونقص الإنتاجية                  ( المالح ، 1997: 2 ) .وإذا تمثل هذا القلق في  خلل واضطراب نفسي المنشأ ناجم  عن خبرات ماضية غير سارة مع تشويه وتحريف إدراکي معرفي للواقع وللذات من خلال استحضار للذکريات والخبرات الماضية غير السارة ، مع تضخيم للسلبيات ودحض للإيجابيات الخاصة بالذات والواقع يجعل صاحبه في حالة من التوتر وعدم الأمن مما يدفعه لتدمير الذات والعجز الواضح وتعميم الفشل وتوقع الکوارث ، وتؤدي به إلى حالة من التشاؤم من المستقبل وقلق التفکير في المستقبل والخوف من المشکلات الاجتماعية والاقتصادية المستقبلية المتوقعة والأفکار الوسواسية وقلق الموت واليأس ، فإنه يعرف بقلق المستقبل ( شقير، 2005 :5 ) ، والذي يعد من المشکلات النفسية الهامة التي تواجه الطلبة ، لما يواجهونه من ضغوط ناتجة عن تخوفهم من المستقبل وبالتالي أصبح التفکير والخوف من المستقبل من الأمور لتي تشغل بال أو فکر الطلبة فهم المستقبل ويفکرون في المستقبل ويتخوفون مما يخبأه لهم وقد ذکر (محمود، 2003 : 34 ) أن بعض الدراسات العربية الحديثة تناولت مفهوم قلق المستقبل ويعد هذا المفهوم وثيق الصلة بمفهوم التوجه نحو المستقبل فهما على طرفي متصل واحد فبقدر ما يکون قلق المستقبل حافزا على الإنجاز فإنه يقترب من التوجه نحو المستقبل وبقدر ما ينخفض مستوى التوجه نحو المستقبل لدى  الفرد فإنه يعبر عن قلقه من هذا المستقبل ودفاعه ضد هذا القلق بالإغراق في الحاضر ( في فراج ،2006 ). وسوف يعرف الباحث الحالي قلق المستقبل بالدرجة التي يحصل عليها الطالب في مقياس قلق المستقبل ، وفق مقياس غالب المشيخي  .        أن نجاح الطالب في المستقبل قائم على قدرته على بناء رؤى واضحة وأهداف محددة  تحفزه على بذل المزيد من الجهد في التحصيل الدراسي والذي  يعتبر محکا أساسيا للحکم على مدى ما يمکن أن يحصله الطالب في المستقبل ، کما أنه يعتبر بمثابة المحصلة لعدد من العوامل المرتبطة بالدافعية والظروف البيئية والنفسية والمزاجية ، وهذا يتطلب استقرارا نفسيا  حتى يتحقق له ذلک  ، فقد   أشارت الدراسات التي أجراها الباحثون في علم النفس أن الطالب المضطرب انفعاليا أو الذي يعاني من القلق أو عدم وجود الأمن والطمأنينة يصبح غير قادر على الترکيز والاستيعاب، فهو مشتت الفکر وبالتالي ينخفض مستوى تحصيله الدراسي والتحصيل الدراسي کما يعرفه أحد الباحثين هو ما يتعلمه الفرد من معلومات خلال دراسته وما يدرکه من علاقات بين هذه المعلومات وما يستنبطه فيها من حقائق تنعکس في أداء المتعلم على اختبار يوضع وفق  قواعد تمکن من تقدير أداء المتعلم تقديرا کميا وهو ما يسمى بدرجات التحصيل ( الحامد ، 1996: 1 ).       وقد أشارت الدراسات إلى إن هناک عوامل أخرى تؤثر على التحصيل الدراسي، مثل المستوى الاقتصادي والاجتماعي لأسرة الطالب ، ومنها دراسة حنين والتي أشارت لوجود ارتباط بين المستوى الاقتصادي للأسرة والتحصيل الدراسي ( في الثبيتي،1409: 19  )، ودراسة کريشنان التي أظهرت نتائجها أن هناک ارتباطا ذا دلالة إحصائية  بين المستوى الاجتماعي والاقتصادي والتحصيل الدراسي (في  الحازمي ، 1410: 58 ) ، وقد أوضحت دراسة قام بها کابلي أن هناک علاقة ارتباطية طردية موجبة بين دخل الأسرة الشهري والتحصيل الدراسي ( في الحازمي ، 1410 :60 ) إلا أننا نجد أن سمة القلق من المستقبل ومستوياته تتفاوت بين طالب وآخر، وفق مدى تفهم الطالب للمادة الدراسية ومدى استعداده للاختبار بالإضافة إلى نوعية التخصص ، کما أشارت بعض الدراسات التي أجريت بهدف التعرف على علاقة قلق المستقبل بالتخصص کدراسة (السبعاوي ، 2007 ) والتي أظهرت وجود علاقة ارتباطية غير دالة بين متغير قلق المستقبل ومتغير التخصص لصالح التخصص العلمي  وهذا ينعکس على أدائه في تحصيله الدراسي ، الذي يعد أکثر المفاهيم النفسية التربوية ترکيبا أو تعقيدا ، نظرا لاشتراک العديد من العوامل والعمليات المدرسية والمحلية والاجتماعية في إنتاجه ، وبالتالي فهو يعرف وفق مفهومين رئيسين هما : أ‌-   التحصيل نفسيا کنتيجة للتعلم : حيث يعد التحصيل والتعلم وجهان لعملة واحدة کلما حدث أحدهما نفترض تلقائيا حدوث الآخر لا محالة في الأحوال العادية للدماغ الإنساني ، وهو نتيجة مباشرة للتعلم ب‌-   التحصيل بيئيا کنتيجة مدرسية : وهو المعارف والمهارات والميول والملاحظة لدى الدارسين لعملية التعلم ( حمدان ، 1417 : 4 )  وسوف يعرفه الباحث الحالي بأنه مجموع الدرجات التي سوف يحصل عليها الطالب في الفصل الدراسي الأول للعام الدراسي 1430 -1431 هـ",

O aumento dos níveis hormonais durante a gravidez atravessa a barreira hematoencefálica e desencadeia alterações na arquitetura cerebral, afetando em particular o hipocampo, a amígdala, o córtex subgenual, o lobo temporal bilateral, a ínsula, os gânglios da base e o cerebelo. Tem-se por objetivo: descrever sobre o período puerperal abordado qaunto aos aspectos da saúde mental da mulher. Entre os fatores de risco para transtornos mentais pós-parto estão baixos status socioeconômico, gravidez indesejada, eventos estressantes da vida durante a gravidez e ausência de suporte familiar. Conclui-se que, os transtornos psiquiátricos na gestação e no puerpério são mais comuns do que se imagina, e muitos casos ainda são subdiagnosticados. Conclui-se que, os transtornos psiquiátricos na gestação e no puerpério são mais comuns do que se imagina, e muitos casos ainda são subdiagnosticados. Tem-se dado importância crescente ao tema, e pesquisas recentes têm focado também o prejuízo que essas patologias podem ocasionar não só à saúde da mãe, mas também ao desenvolvimento do feto, ao trabalho de parto e à saúde do bebê. Múltiplos fatores de risco estão envolvidos, mas a etiologia exata ainda não foi estabelecida. Esses transtornos costumam acometer pacientes que já tenham história de patologia psiquiátrica prévia, portanto, uma boa medida de prevenção é o tratamento adequado desses episódios. Como limitação, entende-se que as medidas de tratamento ainda são amplamente discutidas, devendo-se levar em consideração a relação risco-benefício, sendo, assim, o bom senso do médico um aliado importante quanto à escolha do tratamento nesses casos.",

      "title": "Comorbidity in Children and Adolescents with ADHD",
      "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder with or without hyperactivity disorder is a neurobiological disorder that involves the interaction of the neuroanatomical and neurotransmitter systems. It is a developmental disorder of psychomotor skills that is manifested by impaired attention, motor hyperactivity and impulsivity. This disorder is characterized by early onset, the association of hyperactive and poorly coordinated behavior with marked inattention and lack of perseverance in performing tasks; and this behavior occurs in all situations and persists over time. This disorder is inappropriate for the child’s developmental age and maladaptive. Disorders of neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain with discrete neurological changes can lead to behavioral difficulties and other psychological problems. Most children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have comorbidities, often multiple comorbid conditions in the same person. Comorbidity was observed in both clinical and epidemiological samples. It is estimated that about two-thirds of children with this disorder have at least one other psychiatric disorder diagnosed. Symptoms persist and lead to significant difficulties in the daily functioning of the child, such as school success, social interactions, family and social functioning, etc. Recent studies indicate the presence of various neuroophthalmological disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD. The most common comorbidities in children and adolescents with ADHD that will be covered in this chapter are autism spectrum disorder, mood disorder, anxiety, learning disabilities, conduct disorders, tics disorder and epilepsy.",

These disorders are highly prevalent: Roughly half the population meets criteria for one or more such disorders in their lifetimes, and roughly one fourth of the population meets criteria in any given year. Most people with a history of mental disorder had first onsets in childhood or adolescence. Later onsets typically involve comorbid disorders. Some anxiety disorders (phobias, separation anxiety disorder) and impulse-control disorders have the earliest age of onset distributions. Other anxiety disorders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder), mood disorders, and substance disorders typically have later ages of onset. Given that most seriously impairing and persistent adult mental disorders are associated with child-adolescent onsets and high comorbidity, increased efforts are needed to study the public health implications of early detection and treatment of initially mild and currently largely untreated child-adolescent disorders.",

An increasing number of healthy individuals make use of ‘lifestyle’ drugs, such as nootropics, psychopharmaca, hormones and ecodrugs. In this respect, the fact that many people try to improve their outer appearance, to solve their ‘cosmetic problems’, to influence their rate of hair growth and to altogether delay, halt or even reverse the natural aging process has become a relevant matter for the practising doctor. Lifestyle drugs are taken in an attempt to increase personal life quality by means of attaining a certain psychosocially defined medical or beauty ideal, rather than to manage a medically identifiable, well-defined disease. Often, patients suffering from somatoform disorders such as hypochondriac disorders, body dysmorphic disorders, somatization disorders or persistent somatoform pain disorders may spontaneously ask physicians to prescribe them lifestyle drugs. Also, when ‘healthy’ people demand a lifestyle drug, possible side effects and contraindications must be taken into consideration and ruled out.",

The importance of religion for health can be seen in the definition set forth by the World Health Organization (WHO, 1984), which states that the spiritual aspect is one of the elements of the concept of complete health. From the point of view of mental health, prayer and remembrance of God contain deep psycho-therapeutic elements. This psychoreligious therapy is no less important compared with psychiatric psychotherapy, as it contains spiritual/religious powers which awaken self confidence and optimism (the hope of being cured). These two factors, self confidence and optimism, are two elements essential to curing illness besides medicines and medical treatment administered. Someone who have experienced trauma have difficulty regulating mind-body-spirit functions. Distress, anxiety and depression are outcomes, and its an ongoing process to keep these systems in balance. Modern science and medicine consider human body as merely electro-chemical, electro-mechanical and physical phenomena; human body as the energy system (mind-body-spirit functions).Human energy centers are situated near the key endocrine glands and nerve groups (plexus) that wireless connection to brain and also connection to cosmic universal energy (also called the chakras); while universal cosmic energy (everything is common at atomic level).

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli.

The major clinical finding is the frequent co-occurrence of anxiety disorder with depression. Approximately half of the patients with poststroke anxiety disorder were found to have major depression and about one-third minor depression. The second clinical finding is that the clinical and pathological correlates of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder are different. For example, the duration of anxiety disorder and depression are different. Anxiety but not depression is associated with prior alcohol abuse, acute onset anxiety but not acute onset depression is associated with right hemisphere lesion location, and anxiety and depression have independent or sometimes additive effects on recovery of activities of daily living (ADL), cognitive functioning, and social functioning.",

      "title": "What Is Schizophrenia?",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter describes schizophrenia and its symptoms in more detail. Schizophrenia is a disease of the brain that affects about one percent of the population, usually occurring between adolescence and young adulthood. Its symptoms vary, but they are by nature disruptive to brain functions, and can include such issues as delusions, slow or confused thinking and movements, hallucinations, and so on. These symptoms can be classified into three categories: positive, negative, and cognitive. Positive symptoms are the presence of sensations, beliefs, and behaviors that would not normally occur. Negative symptoms are characterized by a lack of important abilities, usually those dealing with motivation and socialization. Finally, cognitive symptoms refer to difficulties with concentration and memory.",

Das Leben der Patienten mit generalisierter Angststörung ist vor allem durch Sorge - „Worrying” geprägt. Diese ist von unspezifischen Symptomen wie erhöhter Muskelanspannung, Schlafstörungen, Reizbarkeit, Ruhelosigkeit, Konzentrationsschwierigkeiten oder Erschöpfbarkeit begleitet. Der Verlauf der GAD ist in der Regel chronisch-persistent und durch Fluktuationen gekennzeichnet, wobei es unter Belastungen zu einer Exazerbation der Symptomatik kommen kann. Um eine GAD erkennen und richtig diagnostizieren zu können, bedarf es eines guten Verständnisses dessen, was unter dem Leitsymptom des sich sorgens - „Worrying” zu verstehen ist und welche psychologischen Prozesse dabei wirksam werden. Wichtig ist die Abgrenzung der GAD zu oft primär in der Krankheitsgeschichte als komorbide Erkrankungen gestellten Zusatzdiagnosen.",

During this age period the most different interrelationships between depressions and somatic pathology can be observed: Depressions can be concomitants of somatic pathology or pathogenetically connected with somatic diseases most often with pathology of nervous, cardiovascular, and endocrine systems and osteoarticular apparatus (somatogenic depressions). Psychogenic and medicamentous depressions can also exist [1-4].

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Antidepressants",
      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

The exact cause of depression isn't fully understood, even though biological factors like imbalance in neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine play a significant role. Psychological factors, such as trauma, chronic stress, low self-esteem, and negative thinking patterns, can contribute to the development and exacerbation of depression. Diagnosis of depression involves assessing persistent feelings of sadness or loss of interest in daily activities, along with other accompanying symptoms, lasting for at least two weeks. Depression is a treatable condition, which may include psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy), medication (such as antidepressants), and lifestyle changes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Body image is a person’s perception of his/her physical appearance. There is little relation between the actual appearance and sense of attractiveness. Great physical appearance doesn’t guarantee a positive body image, or does lacking natural beauty lead to a negative body image. In fact, beauty doesn’t properly reflect one’s feelings of body image; it depends on one’s appearance. There are relations between body image and feeling, thinking and acting in particular conditions (1). One of the key features of the ‘Body Dysmorphic Disorder’ (BDD) definition is excessive preoccupation with slight or imagined defect in body appearance (2). BDD has the worst outcome of all the body image disorders (3). Since BDD has a negative impact on quality of life (4) screening BDD patients in clinical settings seems important (5). Sense of body image may put an adolescent’s physical health at risk (6). However, physical concerns don't necessarily reflect body dysmorphic disorder (7). In addition, there are high numbers of BDD patients that have extreme body image dissatisfaction (8). The main feature of BDD is excessive attention to negative body image. Subsequently, negative evaluation of images can lead to rumination, mood changes and compulsive behaviors (3). Self-worth based upon appearance (9) and poor body image is important in BDD (10). The feeling of attractiveness (11) and body image can influence BDD symptoms (12). BDD patients have high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts and also completed suicide attempts (13). Since this disorder can have a devastating effect on the quality of a person's life, it seems necessary to identify it at an early stage (14). Compared to men, women are more likely to undergo cosmetic surgery. Lack of body satisfaction can predict cosmetic surgery. Experience of cosmetic surgery among family or friends can increase the rate of cosmetic surgery in women. Media has no effect on the rate of cosmetic surgery",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by the breakdown of thought processes and emotional disorders. This disease is characterized by a combination of disorders: cognitive (impaired attention, memory, thinking) and behavioral, productive (hallucinatory, delusional, affective, etc.) and negative (apathy, abulia, emotional and social detachment, etc.) symptoms. Schizophrenia causes psychosis, can be accompanied by disability and negatively affect all areas of life, including personal, social life, family and work activities. This disease is also characterized by changes in emotions, loss of concentration, autism, asociality (\"immersion in oneself\", unusual thoughts and fantasies), a drop in energy state and a violation of the will. The sick person does not understand that he is ill, and this complicates treatment. Psychoses become more frequent over time and this leads to frequent hallucinations, and they can affect all the senses. The most common are auditory hallucinations in the form of voices and a person's subordination to voices, which can make the situation dangerous. The absence of treatment for schizophrenia leads to an absolute loss of one's own \"I\", loss of a person's personality, and during an exacerbation of the disease, a person can harm first of all himself and then others. The following research article examines all the factors that can influence the onset and progression of the disease.",

Our patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who had been working in a company for around 33 years and always had good appraisals. He presented to mental health services with a 5-year history of persecutory beliefs, convinced that his employers were out to damage his reputation. Apart from a diagnosis of polycythaemia, a few months before the onset of abnormal beliefs, there is no personal or family history of psychiatric disorder or medical illness. His delusions did not respond to conventional treatment with psychotropic medication possibly due to non-adherence because of side effects. However, a series of venesections lead to an improvement in mental state.",

      "abstract": "Head injury is a common event occurring in 1–2 million people in the U.S. yearly. Head injuries may cause minor inconvenience or it may induce major cognitive changes such as memory loss, concentration difficulties, headache, hearing loss, and visual difficulties, associated with or without loss of consciousness. Two of the major events occurring after head injuries which are not commonly recognized but which significantly alter behavior are loss of smell acuity and subsequent onset of smell distortions or phantosmia. Most patients are unaware that these two events can occur but they are present in most patients who experience head injury of any severity. Initially, patients recognize that they cannot recognize any odors and subsequently recognize that they cannot obtain any flavor from any food or drink. Over time they recognize that they experience a peculiar, usually unpleasant, odor in their nose in absence of any external odor. These odors may be persistent or transient, usually unpleasant, and may be described as fecal‐like, burned, chemical‐like, or metallic. The phantom, if persistent, can be severe enough to initiate loss of appetite with subsequent weight loss and depression. We have evaluated over 200 patients with smell loss and phantosmia after a head injury at The Taste and Smell Clinic in Washington, DC over the past 40 years attempting to understand their cognitive changes in smell function. We have found that the mechanism for these cognitive changes relate to metabolic changes mainly in biochemical changes in both sensory and brain function in which specific growth factors which maintain olfactory function have been diminished and specific brain neurotransmitters, mainly gamma‐aminobutyric acid, have also been diminished. Correction of these abnormalities commonly corrects the smell loss, inhibits the phantosmia and improves cognition.",

      "abstract": "La toxicité cérébrale du cannabis est marquée principalement par des effets cognitifs, addictifs et psychotomimétiques. Troubles cognitifs Plusieurs études ont montré que l’administration aiguë de Δ-9-THC, principal principe actif du cannabis, et que la consommation régulière de cannabis entraînaient des troubles de l’attention, de la mémoire, en particulier de la mémoire de travail et de la mémoire épisodique ainsi que des troubles des fonctions exécutives. Ces troubles ont un impact sur l’apprentissage, les acquisitions scolaires, la conduite d’un véhicule et les tâches complexes. Ils sont liés à la dose, à la fréquence, à la durée d’exposition et à l’âge de la première consommation. Ils peuvent disparaître après sevrage, mais des anomalies durables s’observent chez les sujets ayant débuté leur consommation avant l’âge de 15 ans. Effets addictifs La fréquence sur la vie entière de la dépendance au cannabis, caractérisée essentiellement par le craving , la perte de contrôle de la consommation et le retentissement important sur la vie familiale/professionnelle/sociale est, d’après certaines études, de 1 % en population générale. Le syndrome de sevrage, décrit en 2004, pourrait être inclus dans le DSM-5. Effets psychotomimétiques Fréquents, les symptômes psychotiques induits par la consommation de cannabis (idées de référence, de persécution) disparaissent spontanément dans les 24 heures. Ils durent parfois plusieurs semaines dans les pharmacopsychoses. Neuf études longitudinales ont montré que les sujets qui avaient fumé du cannabis avaient deux fois plus de risque environ que les sujets abstinents, de présenter ultérieurement des troubles psychotiques. Le risque, dose-dépendant, est plus élevé lorsque la consommation de cannabis a débuté avant l’âge de 15 ans et chez les sujets qui ont des antécédents familiaux de troubles psychotiques. L’évolution de la schizophrénie est aggravée par la consommation de cannabis. Toxicité cérébrale du cannabis Elle est liée à l’interaction du Δ-9-THC sur les récepteurs cannabinoïdes cérébraux CB1, localisés principalement dans l’hippocampe, le cervelet, le cortex frontal, le striatum et les ganglions de la base. Plusieurs études ont retrouvé que la consommation de cannabis pouvait interférer avec le système endocannabinoïde cérébral lors de la maturation du cerveau à l’adolescence. Elle favorise aussi des troubles vasculaires cérébraux. Les études d’imagerie cérébrale ont retrouvé que les effets du cannabis, modérés en cas d’usage simple, étaient marqués chez les consommateurs réguliers par une diminution dose-dépendante de la densité de substance grise au niveau de l’hippocampe, des régions parahippocampiques et de l’amygdale.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorder in the elderly is twice as common as dementia and four to six times more common than major depression. Anxiety is associated with poorer quality of life, significant distress and contributes to the onset of disability. Mortality risks are also increased, through physical causes, especially cardiovascular disease, and suicide. Diagnosing anxiety disorders in older adults remains a challenge because of the significant overlap in symptoms between physical disorders (shortness of breath; abdominal and chest pain; palpitations) and depression (disturbed sleep; poor attention, concentration and memory; restlessness). Good history taking is crucial in elucidating whether the complaint is of new onset or a recurrence of a previous disorder. The presence of comorbid depression should be clarified. If present, its temporal relationship with the anxiety symptoms will indicate whether there is an independent anxiety disorder. A medication review is warranted, as a number of drugs may be causative (calcium channel blockers, alpha- and beta-blockers, digoxin, L-thyroxine, bronchodilators, steroids, theophylline, antihistamines) or may cause anxiety in withdrawal (e.g. benzodiazepines). Substance and alcohol abuse should be excluded, as withdrawal from either may cause anxiety. A new or exacerbated physical illness may be related to anxiety. Medical investigations will help clarify the extent to which a particular somatic symptom is the result of anxiety.",

Inindividuals with chronic low back pain, the degree of controlmay change such that performing daily tasks becomescompromised and the chronic nature of the disease issustained (4-7). The mechanisms that lead to such abnorm-alities of postural control remain unclear. Pain is animportant factor in mechanical and neural alterations, butthe extent to which it influences postural balance still cannotbe determined.

      "abstract": "Pain is a subjective experience with two inseparable components: sensory and emotional. The personal property of pain experience makes it difficult to manage and treat due to the influence of genetics, age, gender, spiritual beliefs, social-economic status, and cultural factors. Similarly, medical care methods partly control pain experience and regulate pain progression. Contrary to chronic pain, which is continuous and recurrent, acute pain is primarily due to trauma, acute medical conditions, or treatment. Whatever the case, both can cause mood disorders. The interplay between mood disorders and pain upholds a progressively significant bidirectional link, as mood disorders and pain are risk factors for each other. Depression and anxiety heighten pain perception or decrease pain tolerance. Acute or chronic pain can also increase the chances of mood dysregulation. Although depression and anxiety have a close relationship with acute pain, the interplay between depression and acute pain is more comprehensively studied. Most depressed patients present pain as their sole complaint in primary care practices, which unfortunately is overlooked by physicians. Howbeit, reports on experimentally induced pain perception in depressed patients are mixed, presenting both an amplified and reduced pain threshold and tolerance. Although there are less published data about pain and anxiety, the association is regular because increased anxiety equally increases pain perception while decreasing tolerance. The aim of this review was to elucidate more on the mechanisms delineating the interconnectivity of pain and mood disorders.",

      "abstract": "Medication adherence is increasingly being recognized as a significant issue in treating geriatric patients. A report by the Institute of Medicine1 identified medication nonadherence as a notable source of medical errors.\r\n\r\nPoor adherence has been shown to decrease the effects of prescribed medications or other treatments and to increase the likelihood of poor outcomes.2 Adherence has been related to intermediate clinical outcomes in several diseases. An increased incidence of adverse events has been linked to nonadherence in the elderly.3\r\n\r\nElders' adherence to prescribed medications is a complex phenomenon that depends on an interaction of medical, medication, personal, and economic factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical factors that affect adherence include cognitive abilities, as well as overall health status (eg, number of chronic conditions).\r\n\r\n\r\nMedication factors related to adherence include the characteristics of the medication (eg, dosing frequency or presence of side effects).\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal factors that affect adherence include: \r\n\r\npersonal beliefs about the condition for which the medication is prescribed (eg, how serious the condition is and how likely the medication is to have a positive effect).\r\n\r\n\r\nindividual cognitive abilities, including memory, overall intellectual ability, organization skills, and health literacy. Health literacy has emerged as an important factor that affects older persons' capacity, for example, to make health care choices.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic factors pertinent to medication adherence include whether patients have insurance or other financial resources to pay for the medication.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients' relationship with their physician as well as the physician's communication style can affect adherence.5\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the older adult with memory problems, we have found that whether patients depend on themselves or a caregiver can have a significant impact on adherence.6 Not all caregivers take responsibility for a patient's medication, and family members' beliefs about a medication can also affect the patient's adherence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluation of elders' medication adherence as a factor in treatment success or failure is thus potentially complex, difficult, and time consuming.",

The clinical symptoms of this disorder are distinctive and form the basis for making the diagnosis. The severity of restless legs syndrome varies considerably. Some individuals have severe symptoms that cause repeated and prolonged awakenings. Others are aware of only mild symptoms at bedtime that prolong falling asleep. Patients may complain of insomnia, especially difficulty with sleep onset and repeated nighttime awakenings. Most characteristic of restless legs syndrome are reports of sensations deep in the muscles. This disorder may begin at any age, including during childhood. Restless legs syndrome is strongly associated with iron deficiency. It is also associated with pregnancy (especially the last trimester), kidney failure, dialysis, anemia, cancer, and other medical conditions that cause peripheral nerve and muscle disorders.",

      "abstract": "Dans le quotidien, l'être humain associe intuitivement un sommeil de bonne qualité au bon fonctionnement physiologique et psychologique. D'autre part, la douleur entraîne souvent un sommeil de mauvaise qualité, voire de l'insomnie. Parmi les patients souffrant de douleur chronique (p. ex. lombalgie, douleur orofaciale, fibromyalgie ou arthrite rhumatoïde), près des deux tiers rapportent que leur sommeil n'est pas suffisamment récupérateur. La relation entre la douleur et le sommeil est soit unidirectionnelle soit bidirectionnelle-circulaire. Une crise de douleur aiguë, précédant le plus souvent une plainte de mauvais sommeil, suggère une relation unidirectionnelle. Toutefois, chez les patients souffrant de douleur chronique ou intense (p. ex. post-brûlure), à une mauvaise nuit de sommeil succède une exacerbation diurne de la douleur qui, à son tour, peut diminuer la qualité du sommeil suivant et ainsi de suite. Il s'agit alors d'un trouble bidirectionnel circulaire. Des études polysomnographiques ont mis en évidence certaines caractéristiques physiologiques chez le patient souffrant de douleur chronique. La plus fréquente est l'intrusion d'ondes alphadelta électroencéphalographiques dénotant une activité corticale rapide normalement associée à l'état d'éveil. Cette intrusion, d'une durée de 20 à 40 secondes, répétée de façon périodique au cours du sommeil, reflète l'expression de micro-éveils cérébraux et du système nerveux autonome cardio-sympathique. D'autre part, des études expérimentales ont permi de caractériser les effets de la douleur sur l'architecture du sommeil. En effet, on a noté que la douleur induisait des éveils prolongés importants pendant tous les stades de sommeil (léger, profond etparadoxal) contrairement à ce que l'on pense généralement.",

The results revealed that all patients were having intermittent headache (2-3 months) for the duration of up to 2 years. Headache was not affecting the sleep activity or appetite of the child. The factors initiating the headache included disturbed family patterns, family phobia, differential parenting styles including over expectations or ignoring. The heavy school work lead to fear of studies that in turn affected the attendance and the scholastic performance. To some extent, the surrounding environmental factors also lead to difficulty in social adjustment. These certain issues lead to stress headaches for most of the children almost every day. In no case, any family history of any psychiatric illness, traumas or any such kind of headaches as those of migraine, sinusitis, etc. was understood.

      "title": "Psychological Management of Multiple Sclerosis An Overview",
      "abstract": "Eight case histories demonstrate features of the predisposing childhood background met with in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) together with the passive dependent coping mechanisms adopted by the child to ensure short-term survival, but which perpetuated into adult life are inadequate and somatically damaging. First, there is pathological dependence on a parental key figure later transferred wholly or partly to other key figures. The pathological dependence leads to ambivalence over separation from the key figure(s) and the attainment of an independent emotional existence. The childhood of MS patients is overwhelming because it is either turbulent or excessively cloying, and the child's response passive and docile. Other siblings, for reasons such as position in the sibship, or their sex, or inherited toughness, escape the full rigour of parental dominance, or successfully rebel against it. MS subjects are thus especially vulnerable to threats of illness, death or irretrievable severance from key figures but, while detachment is perilous, they also fear and resent engulfment and the loss of any small measure of identity they may have gained. With their infantile attempts at separation at age of 2–3 frustrated, or too feeble for success, and having learned the 'giving-up' response as their only defence against what they see as hopeless odds, it is hardly surprising that bids for independence at adolescence are equally unsuccessful. They often recall a few attempts at adolescent rebellion painfully and quickly put down by the threat of withdrawal by the key figure. Often these adolescent or adult attempts at independence are associated with sexual relationships bedevilled by guilt from early libidinous fantasies, and fears of being trapped into parenthood and responsibility thereby threatening their own position as the dependent child. It is, therefore, no accident that the onset and relapses of MS are commonly associated with the crises courtship, marriage and birth. The women, if they are childless, which is often the case because of their own hang-ups, not infrequently fantasise their sisters' or friends' babies as their own. Because of their superficial affability, men and women are vulnerable to the trauma of being made unwilling confidants especially in the sexual misdemeanours of their neighbours, friends, parents, siblings, children and grandchildren, and identify closely with injured parties; such experiences are frequently provocative of onset nd relapse of MS. MS patients conceal emotions, particularly aggressive emotions, behind a mask. The mask they wear is either smiling, or 1 Based on a paper read to the Society for Psychosomatic Research, London 1976. Paulley 27 unsmiling and flat. The flat mask may incorrectly be interpreted as depression. The moria seen with the brain damage of GPI parallels the gross euphoria of advanced cases of MS, but both are caricatures of the basic mood antedating the disease. Relatives and friends as well as the patient will confirm that the smiling or unsmiling mask is premorbid and an early learned defence to conceal real feelings too dangerous to reveal. In this series there is a predominance of eldest and youngest children, and the histories reveal that they are often the most exposed to the damaging factors mentioned. However, the figures are just below the level of statistical significance. Likewise, the number of only children seemed to be more than one would expect. Psychotherapy is directed to helping these patients in the therapeutic situation to show their feelings, sometimes for the first time in their lives, and bring into consciousness their unconscious habit of hiding more intense feelings behind a smiling or unsmiling mask, and then to learn to lower their defensive mask, not only in the therapeutic situation, but later in their interpersonal relationships. Of necessity this programme also involves helping the patient wherever possible to separate emotionally from his key figure and surrogates. Experience has shown that this is more effectively and rapidly achieved by couple therapy in which the spouse or fiancé(e) affords an empathetic extension of the therapeutic situation beyond the consulting room. It is necessary to maintain therapy over the dangerous period during which dependence becomes attenuated first by substitution of the therapist for the key figure and later by incorporation of the 'good parent' and extrusion of the 'bad'. Subsequently, the link with the therapist may be weakened by spaced interviews but with easy access to the therapist in the event of relapse. Successful psychotherapy is punctuated by substantial remissions of the somatic symptoms of MS. Period of study 1946–1976, number of patients 300+, case notes traced and examined 227 (males 88, females 139). Where sufficient data available: separation and engulfment problems 192/192, smiling mask 112 and unsmiling mask 79.",

      "abstract": "As a symptom state, nearly all humans have personal experience with the feeling of social anxiety. For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

Schizo-obsessive disorder is diagnosed when a person has schizophrenia with co-existing OCD or OCS. It is associated with depressive symptoms, no definitive diagnostic criteria and has poor response to polypharmacotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 23-year-old-man with no significant family history and symptoms suggestive of paranoid schizophrenia, was on intermittent treatment for 6 years. Since the past one year, he also had OCS and depressive symptoms – constantly checking himself if he passed stools, reduced appetite, disturbed sleep, suicidal thoughts. He has multiple hospital visits where they have changed the anti-psychotics and their dosage, given electro-convulsive therapy, but couldn’t be relieved of his symptoms. He was started on high dose antipsychotics of two different classes and serotonin agonists, but still did not improve. CONCLUSION: Schizo-obsessive disorder is a diagnostic difficulty to the clinician, reported to have poor prognosis. It significantly affects one’s general, social and occupational functioning. Research is required on its psychopathology, treatment protocols and its diagnostic criteria is yet to be established. Antidepressant, depression, insight, internalized stigma",

      "abstract": "Functional somatic syndromes are increasingly diagnosed in chronically ill patients presenting with an array of symptoms not attributed to physical ailments. Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome are common disorders that belong in this broad category. Such syndromes are characterised by the presence of one or multiple chronic symptoms including widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and abdominal pain, amongst other issues. Symptoms are believed to relate to a complex interaction of biological and psychosocial factors, where a definite aetiology has not been established. Theories suggest causative pathways between the immune and nervous systems of affected individuals with several risk factors identified in patients presenting with one or more functional syndromes. Risk factors including stress and childhood trauma are now recognised as important contributors to chronic pain conditions. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse during childhood is considered a severe stressor having a high prevalence in functional somatic syndrome suffers. Such trauma permanently alters the biological stress response of the suffers leading to neuroexcitatory and other nerve issues associated with chronic pain in adults. Traumatic and chronic stress results in epigenetic changes in stress response genes, which ultimately leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system manifesting in a broad array of symptoms. Importantly, these systems are known to be dysregulated in patients suffering from functional somatic syndrome. Functional somatic syndromes are also highly prevalent co-morbidities of psychiatric conditions, mood disorders, and anxiety. Consequently, this review aims to provide insight into the role of the nervous system and immune system in chronic pain disorders associated with the musculoskeletal system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.",

      "abstract": "Tidur merupakan bagian hidup manusia yang memiliki porsi banyak,\r\nrata-rata hampir seperempat hingga sepertiga waktu digunakan untuk tidur. Tidur\r\nmerupakan kebutuhan bukan suatu keadaan istirahat yang tidak bermanfaat.\r\nNamun ada kalanya seseorang mengalami kesulitan tidur yang menyebabkan\r\nberkurangnya waktu tubuh untuk beristirahat, maupun untuk menjaga\r\nkeseimbangan metabolisme dan biokimiawi tubuh.\r\nBanyak sekali faktor yang menyebabkan seseorang mengalami insomnia,\r\nantara lain adalah faktor biologis dan psikologis. Kesulitan-kesulitan saat\r\npenyusunan skripsi sering dirasakan sebagai beban berat, akibatnya kesulitan yang\r\ndirasakan tersebut berkembang menjadi perasaan negatif yang menimbulkan\r\nketegangan, kekhawatiran, stress dan dapat menyebabkan insomnia.\r\nPenelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat gambaran insomnia yang dialami\r\nmahasiswa selama menyusun skripsi, penyebab insomnia yang dialami subjek,\r\ngejala yang dialami subjek, serta strategi yang dilakukan untuk mengatasi\r\ninsomnia tersebut. Insomnia merupakan suatu kondisi ketidakpuasan seseorang\r\ndalam hal kuantitas atau kualitas tidurnya dan berlangsung selama beberapa waktu\r\n(Lumbantombing, 2004). Insomnia dapat disebabkan karena masalah psikis pada\r\nseseorang, rasa cemas dan perasaan takut yang berlebihan, bekerja terlampau\r\nlama dan keras, rasa sakit dan perasaan tidak menyenangkan.\r\nSubjek dalam penelitian ini adalah mahasiswa yang tengah menyusun\r\nskripsi yang mengalami insomnia selama lebih dari 1 bulan. Subjek berjumlah dua\r\norang subjek primer, dan dua orang subjek sekunder untuk masing-masing subjek\r\nprimer. Peneliti mengambil sampel penelitian dari mahasiswa psikologi\r\nUniversitas Negeri Semarang. Dalam penelitian ini peneliti menggunakan teknik\r\nobservasi non partisipan, yaitu peneliti secara pasif tidak terlibat langsung dalam\r\naktifitas yang sedang berlangsung dan terjadi sambil mencatat tingkah laku di\r\nsekitarnya. Peneliti juga menggunakan teknik wawancara yang bersifat\r\nsemiterstruktur yaitu wawancara dilakukan secara terbuka tetapi tetap\r\nberpedoman pada pertanyaan-pertanyaan tertulis.\r\nBerdasarkan keseluruhan hasil dan pembahasan dalam penelitian yang\r\ndiperoleh dalam penelitian studi kasus ini maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa, jenis\r\ninsomnia yang dialami subjek termasuk insomnia kronis (cronic insomnia). Bila\r\nsubjek sudah sama sekali tidak bisa tidur (dalam dua puluh empat jam subjek\r\ntidak tidur), subjek langsung meminum obat tidur yang diperjualbelikan secara\r\nbebas. Gejala-gejala insomnia yang dialami subjek antara lain subjek mengalami\r\nkesulitan untuk memulai tidur. AR harus membuat dirinya merasa lelah terlebih\r\ndulu agar dapat tidur, jika tetap tidak dapat tidur maka AR akan memaksakan\r\nmemejamkan mata agar dapat tidur, sedangkan NM harus menutup matanya\r\ndengan kain agar dapat tertidur. Gejala lain adalah kedua subjek merasa lesu dan\r\npusing saat bangun tidur dan susah berkonsentrasi saat melakukan pekerjaan.\r\nFaktor penyebab yang dialami subjek sehingga dapat menyebabkan\r\ninsomnia yaitu yang pertama karena permasalahan yang timbul saat penyusunan\r\nskripsi, yang kedua yaitu karena tuntutan orangtua yang menginginkan agar\r\nsubjek dapat menyelesaikan kuliahnya dengan cepat, dan mendapatkan gelar\r\nsarjana. Adapun faktor yang ketiga yaitu karena waktu perkuliahan yang sudah\r\nmendekati batas. Simpulan keempat, Gangguan insomnia memberikan dampak\r\nnegatif dalam kehidupan subjek. Pertama, akan mengurangi daya tahan tubuh\r\nsehingga berpeluang terhadap munculnya penyakit. Kedua, susah tidur akan\r\nberpengaruh terhadap stabilitas emosi sehingga mempengaruhi aktivitas\r\nkehidupan sehari-hari. Subjek mangalami penurunan tingkat motivasi,\r\nkonsentrasi, ketelitian, kreativitas, dan produktivitas kerja. Dari penelitian yang\r\ntelah dilakukan maka peneliti dapat memberikan saran pada subjek untuk\r\nmengurangi dan menghilangkan segala kekhawatiran dan kecemasan dengan\r\nbersikap optimis dan merilekskan diri saat melakukan pekerjaan, terutama saat\r\nakan tidur.\r\nSaran kedua adalah olahraga pada sore hari (enam jam sebelum tidur).\r\nMelakukan peregangan otot atau jalan kaki secukupnya selama duapuluh menit.\r\nHal ini akan meningkatkan metabolisme dan suhu badan, lalu akan menurun\r\nsekitar enam jam kemudian yang berefek pada tidur yang nyenyak. Ketiga,\r\nMengurangi rokok dan tidak merokok beberapa jam sebelum tidur karena rokok\r\nmengandung nikotin yang dapat meningkatkan semangat karena berefek sebagai\r\nneurostimulan. Selain itu rokok dapat membahayakan kesehatan diri sendiri dan\r\norang lain di sekitarnya, karena orang lain yang tidak merokok tetapi terkena asap\r\nrokok juga akan mengalami gangguan kesehatan dengan resiko yang sama.",

      "title": "[Body dysmorphic disorder: One Hundred Years of Solitude].",
      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder is a common psychiatric disease; its respective prevalence is 2% in the general population, 3.3% in tertiary students, 7.4% among adolescent and adult psychiatric in-patients, and above 10% in patients of cosmetic surgery or dermatology. The most important symptom of the disease is the distorted perception of bodily appearance that leads to low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, social isolation and compulsive behaviours. The disease usually begins during adolescence (average age at onset: 16.7 years), the symptoms have a rather deleterious impact on social relationships, education, work and family life. Comorbidity with affective disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, alcoholism, and substance use disorders is common. The life quality of the affected patients is bad, the risk of suicide is high, and the occurrence of heteroaggressive behaviour is not infrequent either. Despite the great prevalence and the serious consequences, body dysmorphic disorder is diagnosed only in 15% of the cases, and it occurs relatively rarely that the individuals affected by the disease get an adequate treatment. The patients do not usually ask for help because they feel ashamed, or they look for help in wrong places because of lack of insight. In addition, quite many experts working in the health service are not sufficiently familiar with the pheno - mena of this disorder. The authors' objective is to provide a thorough review about body dysmorphic disorder with special regard to the results of the past decade. A substantial recent change is the fact that the disorder, previously categorized in the group of somatoform disorders, has been placed in the group of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in DSM-5. A complex interplay of biological, psychological and sociocultural factors underlies the etio - patho genesis. Pharmacotherapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive-behavioural therapy are still regarded as the most effective treatments for body dysmorphic disorder. The modifications of the latter developed to target misperception of appearance, emotional dysfunction or perfectionism seem to represent promising therapeutic measures in addition to the application of novel methods of information technology.",

      "abstract": "A stressor above a threshold magnitude, or multiple stressors applied simultaneously, cause an organism to alter its behaviour and physiology, with the aim of maintaining homeostasis. The adaptive changes that occur are coordinated and mediated by the stress system in the central nervous system (which includes corticotrophin-releasing hormone and noradrenergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem, respectively), and its peripheral limbs, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic (sympathetic) system. Controlled or self-driven challenges to homeostasis and a normally functioning stress system are crucial for normal development and preservation of self and species. In childhood and adolescence, appropriately functioning neuroendocrine responses to stressors are necessary to allow growth and psychosexual maturation to progress normally. Maladaptive neuroendocrine responses, i.e. dysregulation of the stress system, may lead to disturbances in growth and development and cause psychiatric, endocrine/metabolic and/or autoimmune diseases or vulnerability to such diseases, not only during childhood and adolescence, but also in adulthood.",

      "abstract": "present conditions of technological development and intensity of urban life, noise is a highly prevalent hazard in occupational and communal environment as it accompanies everyday activities at work, home and even during sleep. The negative impact that noise has on human health depends on the level of acoustic pressure and the duration of exposure, or the „dose of noise” received. The major adverse health effect of noise exposure is thought to be its influence on the function of the hearing organ. A defense mechanism in response to excessive noise is temporary (hearing) threshold shift, which is a transient effect. However, permanent threshold shift, resulting from noise-induced effects within the critical organs of inner and middle ear, is irreversible and corresponds to the hearing loss. The health effects of noise exposure are not limited only to the hearing organ but they may also concern the functions of the cardiovascular, digestive, hormonal and nervous systems as well as the impact on mental health and ageing. Both the large-scale epidemiological studies and case-control studies provide evidence for a significant correlation between noise intensity and the risk of myocardial infarction and arterial hypertension. The findings refer both to communal and occupational noise. According to the state-of-the-art knowledge, such risk of cardiac effects should be considered particularly in individuals exposed to high levels of noise. Recently, some reports have also been published on a possible relationship between noise exposure and type 2 diabetes. It was found that household noise levels > 60 dB were associated with a 22% increase in the risk of diabetes among fa milies dwelling there, compared to lower levels of household noise. The health effects of noise exposure that are not related to hearing tend to be more pronounced in individual s already suffering from hearing impairments and in elderly persons. Exposure to noise was also found to be a risk factor of premature retirement due to the worker’s general health condition.",

Comorbid anxious features often complicate the recognition of depression and may herald a poor prognosis. We report the results of a cross-sectional naturalistic study to determine the impact of three interventions (no antidepressant, fluoxetine, or tricyclic antidepressant therapy) on relative risk of work days lost in 454 French outpatients with either major or minor depression. Most depressed patients also manifested anxious features (76% with a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score ≥ 12). The presence of anxiety was related to the severity of depression, work absenteeism, and current social instability. Depression severity (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score ≤ 26, including the contributions of anxious symptoms), psychiatric comorbidity, and psychomotor retardation best predicted continued work absenteeism. Patients with major depression were more likely to receive an antidepressant if they had a past history of depressive episodes and/or previous work disability. Patients with minor depression were less likely to receive drug therapy than patients with major depression, despite their current work disability. Among patients who received fluoxetine or a tricyclic antidepressant for at least 8 weeks, fluoxetine was associated with statistically significantly lower mean anxiety and depression scores and fewer work days missed.",

Ältere psychisch Kranke haben krankheitsbedingt häufig ihre sozialen Beziehungen stark eingeschränkt und erleben dies oft als schwere Beeinträchtigung. Außerdem hängt die Prognose der psychischen Erkrankung nach der Entlassung von der erfolgreichen Wiederaufnahme der sozialen Aktivitäten ab. Zwei Umfragen in den 60 gerontopsychiatrischen Tageskliniken in Deutschland ergaben, dass im überwiegenden Teil soziale Aktivierung fester Bestandteil des Therapieprogramms ist. Dabei zeigten sich aber erhebliche Unterschiede im Vorgehen. Die große Mehrheit der antwortenden Tageskliniken nutzte hierzu entweder ausschließlich offene Seniorenangebote am Wohnort des Patienten, oder in Kombination mit dem Besuch sozialpsychiatrischer Einrichtungen. Nur eine kleine Minderheit aktivierte ausschließlich in sozialpsychiatrischen Einrichtungen. Dabei begleitete der überwiegende Teil der Tageskliniken die Patienten entweder ständig oder mindestens initial. Dagegen praktizierten fünf überwiegend verhaltenstherapeutisch orientierte Tageskliniken schon von Anfang an eine Aktivierung ohne therapeutische Begleitung. Die möglichen Gründe für diese Varianz könnten in Unterschieden bei den Patienten, dem lokalen Angebot an Senioreneinrichtungen oder anderen örtlichen Besonderheiten liegen.",

      "title": "Las suprarrenales en la hipoxia o anoxia",
      "abstract": "La disminución de tensión de oxígeno (hipoxia) es una situación de emergencia que somete el organismo a un esfuerzo (stress), el cual provoca múltiples modificaciones, algunas específicas o sea debidas a la disminución de oxígeno y otras generales, como ser el síndrome de adaptación. Si el animal sobrevive se observa una evolución de los fenómenos en tres fases: a) aguda o reacción de alarma; b) de adaptación o aclimatación; c ) de desadaptación o desaclimatación o descompensación. El sistema nervioso, estimulado inicialmente por la hipoxia, modifica la función de la corteza y la médula suprarrenal. La acción sobre la corteza se debe a que la acción nerviosa central provoca un aumento de la secreción de adrenocorticotrofina por la pars distalis de la hipófisis. La acción sobre la médula suprarrenal consiste en un estímulo sobre los centros simpáticos superiores (hipotálamo, etc.), que siguiendo la médula espinal y los nervios esplácnicos mayores y menores produce una fuerte descarga de adrenalina. Si la hipoxia es intensa o se provoca la asfixia, la descarga de adrenalina es una de las más intensas que pueden observarse y dura varios minutos. La reacción inicial sobre la corteza se produce al través de la hipófisis y por lo tanto falta en animales hipofisoprivos. La descarga de adrenocorticotrofina produce: a) disminución del ácido ascórbico, colesterol y lípidos de la corteza; b) el aumento de secreción de hormonas corticoadrenales produce disminución del timo y tejido linfático (acción linfolítica); c ) en la sangre, linfopenia y eosinofilopenia; d) aumento de los hidratos de carbono del organismo, en especial el glucógeno hepático, en animales en ayuno expuestos a la hipoxia; e) aumento de excreción de nitrógeno durante dicho ayuno; f) aumento de excreción de los 17-cetoesteroides urinarios. Durante la fase de adaptación o aclimatación vuelven a aumentar las grasas y el colesterol y sube el peso de la suprarrenal. Durante esta adaptación o aclimatación, la hipoxia es mejor soportada y produce menor disminución del ácido ascórbico suprarrenal. El peso corporal que había disminuido vuelve a recuperarse. Varios autores han comprobado que las hormonas activas sobre el metabolismo de los hidratos de carbono producen aumento de resistencia a la hipoxia. No se produjo con el extracto que empleamos y en las condiciones que experimentamos. La suprarrenal parece desempeñar un papel en la resistencia a la hipoxia. Si ésta es permanente o se repite todos los días, se ha encontrado que las ratas suprarrenoprivas no la soportan. No comprobamos esto en la anoxia aguda de 2 horas, ya sea por el corto tiempo de nuestros experimentos o por la raza de ratas empleadas. Es fácil comprender que se adicionen los síntomas de shock producidos por la hipoxia con los que produce la insuficiencia suprarrenal. Es posible producir un aumento de resistencia de las ratas normales o aún suprarrenoprivas, sometiéndolas paulatinamente una vez por día, durante períodos cortos (2 horas) a depresiones cada día mayores. En la hipoxia intensa permanente y prolongada o bien repetida diariamente durante períodos largos, se ha podido comprobar a la larga una pérdida de la adaptación. Se ha observado que reaparecen: la depleción de lípidos en la corteza, la disminución de resistencia a la hipoxia, la hipoglucemia, una tendencia a la temperatura subnormal. etc. En resumen: la hipoxia produce un aumento de actividad del sistema hipofiso-corticosuprarrenal y también, si es intensa, provoca una descarga de adrenalina de la médula suprarrenal por intermedio del mecanismo simpático-méduloadrenal. La presencia de la función suprarrenal favorece la resistencia del organismo durante la hipoxia, como sucede en todos los casos de emergencia. El aumento de las funciones cortical y medular puede cooperar con los demás mecanismos de resistencia del organismo, en una proporción que es difícil de precisar cuantitativamente.",

It provides enjoyable feelings which results in creating a strong urge to use the substances again and again. These drugs can cause physical dependence or psychological dependence or both. Over time, drug tolerance is produced which means to get the same effect more quantity of the drug is needed. These substances are very harmful physically, mentally, financially and socially too. If someone suddenly terminates using these substances after heavy or long term use, the body needs time to recover and number of withdrawal symptoms arises. These withdrawal symptoms can’t be treated by medications only but it needs counselling and support as well.

The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "abstract": "РЕЗЮМЕ. Підлітковий вік часто супроводжують стани емоційного дискомфорту – тривоги, страху, відчуття самотності, ізольованості. Тривожність негативно впливає не лише на емоційне самопочуття людини, а й у подальшому порушує функціональні можливості психіки, гальмуючи її розвиток як особистості. Так звані «хронічні тривоги» здебільшого перетворюються на патопсихологічні розлади, а значна кількість тривожних дітей мають проблеми зі здоров’ям. Як відомо, температура довкілля має вагомий вплив на організм. Добре самопочуття та висока працездатність залежать від перепаду температури. Аномальні та швидкі зміни температури можуть негативно впливати на всіх людей. Найбільше на зміну навколишнього середовища реагують метеочутливі люди, та ті, хто мають хронічні захворювання, інваліди, люди похилого віку, жителі великих міст. Мета роботи – визначити стан тривожності, самопочуття, активності та настрою у підлітків із різною теплочутливістю. Було проведено тестування 160 осіб підліткового віку, яких попередньо було поділено на дві групи – із високою та низькою теплочутливістю – на основі опитувальника «Рівні теплочутливості» (авторське свідоцтво № 115529 від 01.11.2022 р.) та теплової проби. Тривожність (особистісну та ситуативну) досліджували за допомогою шкали тривоги Спілбергера – Ханіна (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory – STAI). Самопочуття, активність та настрій ми визначали із використанням тестової методики самооцінки функціонального стану «САН» (В. А. Доскіна та ін.). Установлено нижчий рівень ситуативної та особистісної тривожності, а також краще самопочуття, активність та настрій у осіб із низькою теплочутливістю, порівняно із високою. Виявлено залежність самопочуття, активності та настрою від рівня тривожності в осіб із різною теплочутливістю. Вивчення дозволить прогнозувати відновлення стану здоров’я і професійну успішність в умовах підвищених стресових чинників, окреслювати шляхи адаптації осіб із високою теплочутливістю. Висновки. Знижені самопочуття, активність та настрій спостерігаються в осіб із високою теплочутливістю, порівняно із підлітками із низькою теплочутливістю. Так, рівень самопочуття в осіб із низькою теплочутливістю становив (4,91±0,13) балів, а із високою – (3,75±0,30) балів, активності відповідно – (4,88±0,14) та (3,78±0,26) балів та настрою – (5,08±0,13) і (4,23±0,28) балів. Спостерігався вищий рівень ситуативної та особистісної тривожності в осіб із високою теплочутливістю, порівняно з підлітками із низькою теплочутливістю. Так, рівень ситуативної тривожності у осіб із низькою теплочутливістю становив (33,65±1,28) балів, а із високою – (44,77±2,68) балів, особистісної тривожності відповідно – (33,75±1,33) та (46,30±2,29) балів. Установлено залежність самопочуття, активності та настрою від рівня тривожності в осіб із різною теплочутливістю.",

La ansiedad se desencadena por alguna situacion de riesgo o\r\nalarma, tanto en la autoestima como en el estado fisico, frente a eventos adversos o a la\r\nincertidumbre, ademas ante a la posibilidad de fracaso o perdida.\r\nUna mala experiencia durante un tratamiento dental pasado puede ser suficiente para que\r\nel paciente evite asistir al odontologo. Aunque lo considere necesario, lo hara unicamente\r\nfrente a la situacion extrema que no le deje alternativa, dando como resultado una\r\nalteracion de la conducta del paciente al asistir al consultorio odontologico, que resulta en\r\nla poca colaboracion de este. El temor puede acrecentarse al punto de abandonar todo\r\ntratamiento, sea este leve o complicado. Un paciente ansioso dificulta el tratamiento, pues\r\nsuele amplificar tanto sintomas como sensaciones de dolor, molestia a los sonidos de la\r\npieza de alta y baja velocidad, a olores y sabores, no coopera y, como resultado, ambos\r\n(paciente y profesional) terminan estresados e insatisfechos, por lo cual se posterga el\r\nrestablecimiento de la salud bucal.\r\nEste trabajo de investigacion tiene como objetivo determinar la prevalencia de ansiedad\r\ndental en adultos en la Clinica Odontologica de la Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia\r\nde Pasto.

Los\r\nresultados indicaron que existe una ansiedad de moderada a severa en 76,2%. Las\r\ncaracteristicas donde se presento un mayor nivel fue en un rango de edad entre 25-34\r\nanos, estar en estrato 3 y vivir en una zona urbana, mientras en una ansiedad elevada\r\nhaber tenido una experiencia negativa entre 6-9 anos.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common, recurrent, often underdiagnosed and undertreated disorder in older people. 10-15% of the elderly present depressive symptoms and 3% of that same population meet criteria for a major depressive episode. Several factors, such as psychosocial changes, may be related to the onset of depressive episodes. Retirement (often accompanied with feelings of loss of status, both in the family and in the society), the decrease of social contacts with a tendency to isolation, and the difficulties to adapt to new activities and routines, all lead to feelings of inadequacy, worthlessness and a poor self-esteem. The aim of this poster is to show and discuss the importance in recognizing some psychosocial factors that can predict the onset of depressive symptoms in the elderly. We report a case of a 66-year-old man, without previous psychiatric history, who presented a major depressive episode with psychotic features, after an important life event (retirement). Depression in older people has severe consequences, afflicting not only patients but also the caregivers. The amplification of previous disabilities associated with medical and cognitive disorders, the increased rate of mortality by suicide and the increased costs to the health care system are common consequences. To reduce such threats we propose a clinical and social approach that evaluates and regards the different stages of the life cycle and valorize the achieved experiences of older patients.",

      "abstract": "The personality development of the child who is afflicted with a neuromuscular disorder from birth may differ greatly from that of normal children. The usual environmental and psychological factors that influence maturation are modified by the attitudes of other persons toward the disabled one and by his own attitudes toward his defects and the limitations which they impose upon him. During the first few formative years, the normal child develops increasing physical independence as his motility and equilibrium patterns mature, enabling him to erect himself against gravity and to locomote independently. This growing capability is paralleled by the ego development and the appreciation of body image concept. The development of speech is a major step in communication and greatly facilitates the child's contact with his environment. The alteration of these patterns of maturation by central or peripheral neuromuscular disorders may influence profoundly the individual's personality. This results from the anxiety",

This chapter argues that such disabilities have serious consequences for the individual at a number of levels. The significance of chronic illnesses and disabilities for health care systems can be established from surveys of prevalence. The social and psychological consequences vary for different illnesses. The long-term management of head injury and Cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) commonly rests with the family and occurs with little or no assistance from the medical or paramedical services. CVAs involve an acute disturbance of the vascular system in or near the brain. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a frequent consequence of head injury.",

Although test scales measuring fatigue and depression share a significant number of items related to somatic functioning,2 most authors distinguish fatigue from depression, the latter being characterized by lack of selfesteem, despair or a feeling of hopelessness. Most authors also agree that fatigue does not depend on overall or motor disability (as measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)3). This is in line with the clinical observation that fatigue may be the presenting symptom of MS, occurring at a time where there is minimal or no neurological disability.1",

      "title": "[P‐169]: Stress, meditation and memory: An emerging hypothesis",
      "abstract": "The risk of cognitive impairment, primarily as a result dementia and other illnesses, increases with advancing age, and for many people is therefore associated with a dreaded fear of growing old and senile. Cognitive impairment is by no means an inevitable consequence of aging, however. On the other hand, cognitive vitality, the maintenance of robust brain function in every day life, which is essential to both quality of life and survival in old age, may require active steps in order to prevent the loss of brain function. In this workshop, we review the evidence in support of various lifestyle interventions mainly stress reduction that affect cognitive vitality in later life. A strong connection between cognitive and emotional health has been demonstrated in a wide variety of studies. Everyday cognitive functioning is also strongly affected by emotional stress and other factors which can negatively impact cognitive processing, and when persistent may also cause structural changes in the brain. How stress is perceived and experienced by individuals is highly variable and somewhat subjective. Studies in humans suggest that how stress is perceived is critical to how damaging stress is to the body and brain, and that it is the sense of being overwhelmed by stress that influences brain structures and may results in associated memory defects. Acute stress is also associated with impaired cognitive functioning, especially in older adults. In addition to environmental and other lifestyle changes to reduce stress, other clinical strategies for stress reduction may include prayer, meditation, art therapy, dance therapy, as well as exercise. In general, each of these activities are also considered to have positive effects on overall health, function and well-being. Frail elderly individuals with decreased brain reserve may be particularly at risk for stress-related cognitive impairment. Though not well studied in the elderly, more intensive training in stress reduction, including adaptive methods for responding to stress, may potentially be useful as a means to promote cognitive vitality for selected high-risk individuals.",

Los resultados indican niveles de resiliencia ligeramente por debajo de la media normativa. La capacidad de resiliencia tiene diversas correlaciones con elementos del bienestar psicologico y esta negativamente asociada con la ansiedad y la depresion.

      "abstract": "Introdução: Cefaleia representa um problema de saúde pública, podendo ser primárias, quando são por si só a patologia ou secundárias quando são apenas um sintoma de uma outra patologia de base. Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

Insomnia is the inability to fall asleep at night for many hours or inability to have a sound sleep, which deprives one of natural rest and interferes with activities during the day. Each of us has suffered a restless night at some point in our lives. We’ve all occasionally sacrificed sleep for a cram session before an exam, or an important deadline. Many of us also know the feeling of losing sleep due to an intense emotional upset or the accumulation of stress or anxiety. For some of us, loss of sleep is short-lived; for others, it is chronic and we’ve come to anticipate losing sleep on a regular basis. Insomnia can be caused by elevated or chronic stress, illness, physical discomfort, environmental factors, changes in our schedules, side effects from prescribed medications, depression, anxiety, and…",

      "title": "Family Stress and Counseling",
      "abstract": "Stress is a continually growing concern in our society. The impact of stress on mental health and physical illness can be significant and a major factor in healthcare costs in the United States. A large percentage of Americans report feeling moderate-to-high stress levels on a daily basis [1]. When stress extends to include family and social aspects of one's life, complexities can exist beyond just individual coping of a situation or event. Stress has been seen by both patients and physicians as influencing health outcomes. However, stress is often difficult to define and study, in relation to both physical symptoms and external causes [2]. Family stress can be viewed as a disturbance in the ongoing state of a family system. This disturbance can occur both outside of the system (e.g., war, unemployment, natural disaster) and inside the family system (e.g., death, divorce, chronic illness). This systemic stress creates a change in the family's routine functioning [3]. Normative stressors (e.g., birth of a child, job transition, loss of an older adult) in families are considered to be common and predictable sources of stress. Nonnormative family stressors (e.g., early widowhood, job loss, natural disaster) are uncommon and unexpected and may occur at times other than those expected in the life cycle of the family or its members [4, 5]. How well the family unit copes with these two types of stressors largely impacts both the short-term and long-term adjustments and well-being of both the unit and the individuals in it.",

      "title": "Some Psychosomatic Aspects of Food Allergy",
      "abstract": "Summary Some patients experience untoward idiosyncratic reactions when they eat certain wholesome foods. Such illness may be caused by psychogenic or allergenic mechanisms, or by both. The relative importance of psychogenic and allergenic factors in the production and continuance of food-induced illness must be estimated correctly in order to plan a correct program of therapy. This paper reports some of my experiences with the treatment of about 600 patients (seen in the past ten years) who had certain food-induced syndromes, with or without associated primary neuropsychiatric disturbances. Foods become endowed with various dynamic emotional meanings according to the person's upbringing, cultural and religious training, and personal life experiences. Psychogenic food reactions may include anger, anxiety, anorexia, depression, euphoria, feelings of security, guilt, hostility, passive-dependent attitudes, pleasure, syncope, and relaxation. The most common untoward idiosyncratic psychosomatic reactions to food include nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort or pain, intestinal cramps, aerophagia, belching, and rarely diarrhea--all being part of the riddance reaction. The symbolic supportive values of certain foods are such that a person may overeat these foods when he is subjected to unusual emotional stresses. Such categories of foods include the \"security,\" \"reward,\" and \"pleasurable association\", foods. An individual may eat excessive amounts of these foods during times of emotional stress, even though they may be the very ones which produce his allergic illness. The fixed food allergy is very well known, but relatively uncommon. The variable food allergy is very common, but not very well known. In the variable food allergy, tolerance for a given food may vary so that at some times small amounts of the offending food will cause an allergic reaction. But at other times the amount of this food which must be ingested to cause an allergic reaction may be very much greater than any amount that the patient would ordinarily eat. Allergic reactions following the ingestion of offending foods have certain characteristics: there is a latent period between ingestion of the food and the appearance of signs and symptoms; the allergic syndrome has a certain pattern of development and regression of signs and symptoms; it has intensity and duration. These properties in part determine the nature of allergic reactions to repeated ingestion of subthreshold and threshold doses of offending foods. With brief postcibal allergic reactions, each ingestion of a threshold dose of offending food is followed by a discrete reaction. Usually there is no summation of subclinical effects produced by ingestion of repeated subthreshold doses. Repeated daily ingestion of threshold doses of foods which give prolonged postcibal allergic reactions will cause a clinical pattern of allergic reaction resulting from summation, fusion, and adaptation to each individual allergic insult, until finally many patients may develop a steady state of allergic reaction. The daily ingestion of subthreshold doses of such foods is capable of causing a clinically obvious allergic reaction through virtual summation of clinically inapparent allergic reactions caused by ingestion of each subthreshold dose. Each primary allergic reaction set off by ingestion of an unknown allergenic food actuates a secondary postnoxious pattern of behavior which becomes an important part of the patient's reaction to the offending food. But if a patient knows he is eating an allergenic food which will make him sick in a specific way, he does not develop the secondary postnoxious behavior pattern. Recurrent episodes of spontaneous food-induced allergic illness occurring at unpredictable intervals cause certain patterns of conditioned responses in humans. Not knowing when he will be well or sick acts as a frustrating cue, in response to which a patient develops the human counterpart of the non-problem-solving behavior described by Maier for frustrated rats. These secondary reaction patterns of behavior often become so prominent and extensive a part of the patient's complaints to the doctor that even an astute allergist at first glance may consider mistakenly that the patient's problems are purely psychiatric. But further careful clinical study of such a patient will show that he is experiencing a primary allergic reaction to an offending food, which in turn sets off a chain of behavior patterns which are the patient's unconscious response to his allergic illness. Sometimes the secondary behavior patterns engendered by intermittent allergic episodes may become so incapacitating to the patient that they constitute his chief health problem. The food-induced allergic mental, fatigue, and pain syndromes are described. These may occur singly or in any combination, and may be associated with any other allergic syndromes. The patient's response to combined allergic and psychological therapy is illustrated by three case reports. As a result of psychotherapy alone, a patient may unconsciously modify his diet so that he includes less of the security, reward, and pleasurable association foods. If he is also allergic to these foods, he will have a remission in his illness as an indirect consequence of psychotherapy. Many patients are relieved of allergic ill health when they abstain from known offending foods. However, some of these patients will have conscious or unconscious needs at certain times to eat allergenic foods which they know will make them sick. The subtle nature of food-induced self-injury readily escapes the attention of the patient's family and friends--and even, sometimes, of his unsuspecting physician. Self-inflicted, food-induced allergic illness can become a recurrent problem until the physician can understand the basic psychodynamics of such self-injurious behavior, and can then help the patient to make better adjustments to life problems. The best management of all patients with food allergies requires both expert allergic therapy and expert psychotherapy.",

When anxiety occurs too often, a patient loses control over it and tends to avoid situations and is thus restricted in his/her everyday life. The most important forms of anxiety disorders in psychosomatic primary care are panic disorder, agoraphobia and generalised anxiety disorder. Very often anxiety symptoms are hidden by physical symptoms. Basic psychosocial interventions include strengthening autonomy, explaining the vicious circle of fear and also relaxation techniques (breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation). The core features of obsessive compulsive disorder are obsessions (intrusive, unwanted thoughts) and compulsions (performance of highly ritualized behaviours intended to neutralise the negative thoughts and emotions resulting from the obsessions).",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders, affective/emotional disorders and exposure to adverse life circumstances are the main sources of psychological impairment in school age children. They should be distinguished from transient psychological symptoms occurring in normal development that do not significantly affect children's emotional and social functioning. An early recognition and assessment is the first step towards adequate treatment of conditions associated with psychological impairment. Any severe or persistant behavioral or emotional symptom occurring in children should be considered a possible early sign of a neurodevelopmental disorder warranting further investigation. Neurodevelopmental disorders are generally associated with delays early in development affecting several domains (language, social functioning, emotional and behavorial regulation) and are predominant in boys. These disorders are highly comorbid and require multidisciplinary assessments and treatment plans. Emotional and behavioral conditions arising from early deprivation or maltreatment also affect various developmental domains and may have lasting consequences. Finally, many of the disorders showing rising prevalences in adolescence or early adulthood also have some developmental precursors before puberty. Progress in identification, appropriate assessment and treatment of early manifesting symptoms and conditions interfering with adaptive functioning is a major mental health issue requiring multidisciplinary competencies.",

The mentioned symptoms should be present for a minimum period of two weeks for the diagnosis of major depression to be established. Left untreated, major depressive disorder may interfere with daily life activities and eventually leads to suicide, which is one of the leading cause of death in the United States. In this report, the referred case study for major depressive disorder will be the scenario of a 30 year old woman who attempted suicide by consuming 8 bodrex pills.

MUS are found across all specialties, can cause similar levels of disability to symptoms caused by disease, and may utilize high levels of healthcare resource due to frequent attendance and repeated investigation. These conditions include conversion disorder, illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis), somatic symptom disorder, and factitious disorder. While the term MUS recognizes the uncertainty around causation, it is less helpful clinically. The cornerstone of management is to assist the patient in finding an explanation that is helpful, enabling collaborative management of symptoms and ultimately allowing for a reduction in utilization of healthcare. We also describe cacosmia, a person's delusional belief that an unpleasant odour can be smelt, versus olfactory reference syndrome, where the person believes he/she emits the unpleasant odour. This can develop for a variety of medical, psychiatric, or psychological causes, but for some a cause may never be identified. We describe an approach to management for clinicians encountering patients with this distressing symptom.",

      "abstract": "The concept of psychological depressive symptoms affecting the terminally ill patient still stood as an unsolved mystery in many clinical practices. The psychological traumatic and depressive stressors are the factors responsible for destroying the quality of life and affected the terminally ill individual in the most degrading ways. Alongside the physical pain symptoms, the terminal ill experience is always accompanied by several unwanted mental disharmonies and emotional sufferings like toxins, mood disorder, trauma, and low self-esteem. The higher level of stress and depression determines the growth of tumors and cancer metastasis rate in any terminal diagnosis. This makes the assessment of the psychological non-pain symptoms essential alongside the physical pain symptoms. Failing to acknowledge the patient's traumatic experience and depressive stressors will make the treatment unproductive and increase suicidal activities.",

      "title": "Resolution of stuttering during ketamine treatment: a case report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Stuttering may include repetition of words in whole or part, difficulty saying words, and elongated pauses in speech. Approximately 5% of children stutter for a period lasting 6 months or more. Most of those children stop stuttering as they approach adulthood, but the condition persists in approximately 1% of adults. The cause of stuttering is unknown. Adults who stutter face substantial burdens in many aspects of their lives. Stutterers may choose not to pursue meaningful employment opportunities, may not be hired for positions they seek, or may be denied promotions or positive performance evaluations. Stuttering can cause physical tension from fear of speaking. Social challenges arise when a person who stutters is seen as less capable or of lower intelligence than fluent speakers. Stuttering causes emotional difficulties through the frustration and embarrassment that disfluent speakers feel. Stutterers may experience a general loss of self-esteem and personal satisfaction in life. Speech therapy is the primary intervention for stuttering. Medications have been investigated as treatments for stuttering, but no medication has been identified that has widespread effectiveness. Case presentation A 60-year-old white non-Hispanic woman who had been a near lifelong stutterer was prescribed ketamine for an unrelated condition and experienced an almost immediate resolution of her stuttering. Conclusions Many possible pharmacological treatments for stuttering have been studied. Some medications appear to be effective in some patients; some appear to be more generally effective but have negative side effects. No reporting in relevant literature has addressed a possible role for ketamine in stuttering treatment. On the basis of this case report, research on the effect of ketamine on stuttering would be useful. Any effective treatment for stuttering would have a significant positive effect on quality of life for persons who stutter.",

      "abstract": "The essential feature of social anxiety disorder (social phobia) is a fear of scrutiny by other people in social or performance situations. The level of anxiety experienced by the person with social anxiety disorder is excessive, and results in substantial impairment in the sufferer's social, family, and professional life. Three distinct subtypes of the disorder have been identified: generalized social anxiety disorder, in which the individual fears a multitude of social situations; nongeneralized social anxiety disorder, in which only 2 or 3 situations are feared; and public-speaking phobia. Results from a number of studies suggest that these subtypes of social anxiety disorder may represent distinct clinical syndromes, with the generalized subtype producing the most severe disability. Despite the prevalence of social anxiety disorder and the disability it causes, this condition remains underdiagnosed, and thus undertreated, by clinicians. This review discusses the barriers that prevent people who have this disorder from seeking help, and the steps that clinicians can take to aid their recognition and treatment of the disorder. It is only by effective diagnosis and treatment that the burden of social anxiety disorder will be lifted, allowing patients to resume a normal life.",

Mental health issues can impair physical health, social and occupational functioning seriously. Thus, the development of preventive strategies has been required. Physical activity is a cost-effective prevention strategy. Besides, substantial physical health-related benefits and a number of psychological benefits have been proved, most evidence seen with depression. For example, physical activity can improve depressive symptoms in those who are diagnosed with major depression, in healthy adults, and in patients with cardiovascular disease or other chronic disease. Regular physical activity appears to be protective against cognitive dysfunction, anxiety and poor sleep. Current evidence supports the conclusion that regular participation in moderate physical activity, consistent with current public health guidelines, gives mental health benefits.",

It should be differentiated from occasional drug use, from drug abuse with minor consequences as well from medical drug dependency in which the individual does not seek a psychological effect. Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief. These psychological disorders frequently underlie medical care needs.",

They are widely regarded as difficult to treat but only a very small proportion is seen by psychiatrists and psychologists.

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Benzodiazepines and Z‐drugs",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most guidelines recommend that benzodiazepines and z‐drugs used continuously for more than 4 weeks should be withdrawn, if the patient is agreeable, because of the unfavourable balance of harms (including physical dependence, addiction, tolerance and withdrawal effects) and benefits. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of benzodiazepines and z‐drugs – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Addiction is an issue only for a small minority of benzodiazepine users whilst withdrawal effects and physical dependence affect a much larger group of patients taking medication as prescribed. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering sometimes formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one benzodiazepine to a longer‐acting drug like diazepam can sometimes be helpful.",

They may be the cause of various mental and physical symptoms. Taking psychoactive substances carries the risk of negative effects on the entire body, including the risk of disorders in physical and emotional development. Psychoactive substances, such as alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs, disturb the functioning of the senses, memory, thinking, motor coordination, and disrupt the development of the entire body.

It arises as a result of organizational change such as implementation of change process or downsizing which is the reflection of response to external changes such as changing dynamics of economies like recession, intense competition; political situations and adaptability. Not only the victims of lay-off suffer from Lay-off Survivor Sickness but also the survivors who remain within the organization go through the same feelings. These conditions sometimes last for months or even years and demographic characteristics of survivors can also influence the duration of lay-off survivor sickness  which do not only affect the employees (Survivors) and their families but also the organizations which sometimes fail to achieve their desirable objectives through downsizing or change process.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety and psychosomatic Desease. Escalation mechanisms and therapeutic strategies from the perspective of systems theory and behavioral therapy Abstract. There is unlikely to be a symptomatic malady or disease in humans that is not accompanied by more or less severe anxiety. This can directly negatively influence bodily disease processes, it always creates or intensifies mental suffering, often it causes the development of an independent anxiety disorder. Pathogenetically, nonlinear amplifications play a central role, as they are typical for complex dynamic systems. While these multiple vicious cycle mechanisms are responsible for the escalation of symptoms, misdirected learning processes bring about a chronification. An integrative model for these pathogenetic relationships is being developed, which at the same time makes it clear how one can synergistically combine established behavioral therapy methods for their treatment. This integrative behavioral therapy is exemplified by a case study.Zusammenfassung. Es dürfte kaum eine symptomatische Funktionsstörung oder Erkrankung geben, die beim Menschen nicht von mehr oder weniger starker Angst begleitet wird. Dies kann körperliche Krankheitsprozesse direkt negativ beeinflussen, immer erzeugt bzw. intensiviert es psychisches Leiden, oft verselbständigt es sich zu einer eigenständigen Angsterkrankung. Pathogenetisch spielen nichtlineare Verstärkungen eine zentrale Rolle, wie sie für Komplexe dynamische Systeme typisch sind. Während diese vielfältigen Teufelskreis-Mechanismen für die Eskalation der Symptome verantwortlich sind, bewirken fehlgeleitete Lernprozesse eine Chronifzierung. Es wird ein Integrierendes Modell für diese pathogenetischen Zusammenhänge entwickelt, das zugleich deutlich macht, wie man etablierte verhaltenstherapeutische Methoden zu ihrer Behandlung synergistisch kombinieren kann. Diese verfahrensintegrierende Verhaltenstherapie wird an einem Fallbeispiel exemplifiziert.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is the most feared of diseases.Unsurprisingly, it causes considerable psychological distress in patients, families, carers, and often those health professionals who care for them.Only a minority of cancer patients develop psychiatric illness, but other psychologically and socially determined problems are common.These include unpleasant symptoms such as pain, nausea, and fatigue; problems with finances, employment, housing, and childcare; family worries; and existential and spiritual doubts.Well planned care that fully involves patients and their families can minimise these problems. Psychological consequencesThough often dismissed as \"understandable,\" distress is a treatable cause of reduced quality of life and poorer clinical outcome.Some patients delay seeking help because they fear or deny their symptoms of distress.Presentation can be obvious, as depressed or anxious mood can manifest as increased severity of somatic complaints such as breathlessness, pain, or fatigue.Adjustment disorder is the commonest psychiatric diagnosis, and neuropsychiatric complications may occur.The risk of suicide is increased in the early stages of coping with cancer. DepressionDepression is a response to perceived loss.A diagnosis of cancer and awareness of associated losses may precipitate feelings similar to bereavement.The loss may be of parts of the body (such as a breast or hair), the role in family or society, or impending loss of life.Severe and persistent depressive disorder is up to four times more common in cancer patients than in the general population, occurring in 10-20% during the disease. Anxiety, fear, and panicAnxiety is the response to a perceived threat.It manifests as apprehension, uncontrollable worry, restlessness, panic attacks, and avoidance of people and of reminders of cancer, together with signs of autonomic arousal.Patients may overestimate the risks associated with treatment and the likelihood of a poor outcome.Anxiety may also exacerbate or heighten perceptions of physical symptoms (such as breathlessness in lung cancer), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (with intrusive thoughts and avoidance of reminders of cancer) occasionally follow diagnosis or treatment that has been particularly frightening.Certain cancers and treatments are associated with specific fears.Thus, patients with head and neck cancers may worry about being able to breathe and swallow.Patients may develop phobias and conditioned vomiting in relation to unpleasant treatments such as chemotherapy.",

Sleep is necessary for cognition, alertness, vigilance, and sustenance of attention as well as control of emotions. The effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance and other psychological variables have been widely studied. Sleepiness, the short-term effect of inadequate sleep, may lead to irritability, reduced alertness, poor motor skills, and attention problems.

From the frequency with which such histories are elicited,it appears that there is a strong congenital predisposition to the disease. Indeed, in quite a series of the cases herein reported, two, three, and even four members of a family have been afflicted with exophthalmic goiter. In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence. There are doubtless many thousands of individuals possessing a strong susceptibility to exophthalmic goiter who are going through life in an apparently normal manner, oblivious to possibilities which would likely follow the incidence of a psychic trauma.",

This article embraces mental health problems that patient may suffer during course of treatment. It is essential to take mental health care of both partners.

It is mandatory for family members to take care of mental health of both partners otherwise mental health issues can delays the good outcome of treatment. If needed it is required to seek help from psychiatrist.

      "abstract": "Little is known of the nature and origins of the attitudes that older people have towards ageing, disease, and medical treatments. Several studies on older people in the community have suggested under-reporting of symptoms. There may be several reasons for this, including the possibility that some older people regard disease processes as a natural feature of ageing and, consequently, feel that medical intervention may have little to offer.To investigate the perceptions of older people about the significance of symptoms and what action they would take in response to particular symptoms.Thirty-three men and 77 women attending social clubs (median age 78 years) were opportunistically selected and assessed using a supervised questionnaire.Many symptoms classically associated with common diseases were often considered to represent disease as well as to be normal for old people. Most would consult a doctor if they were to experience them. Some important symptoms, such as blackouts or paralysis of a limb, were not considered to be normal. Non-specific symptoms of psychiatric disturbances were also frequently considered normal but were not considered to represent disease. Whether or not a doctor would be consulted was often, but not always, related to whether a symptom was thought to represent a disease. Consulting a pharmacist was seldom considered appropriate.Doctors working with elderly people need to consider how beliefs about health and disease might affect what is reported to them. Specific enquiry needs to be made about symptoms of psychiatric disturbances. These findings suggest that there is a case for increased health education at retirement age.",

The etiology of FMS remains unknown, being one of the most accepted hypothesis the presence of central sensitization to pain and impairments in endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms. The history of the development of FMS concept reveals how other symptoms -apart from pain- has become also relevant in FMS diagnosis and treatment.&#x0D; The central symptom of FMS is pain. FMS patients generally report high levels of clinical pain, which are related to greater impairments in health related quality of life, cognitive abilities and disease course. Fatigue and sleeping difficulties are also common symptoms of FMS. Fatigue have shown positive associations with pain, stiffness, sleep problems, increased body mass index, FMS severity, tenderness, disability, cognitive complaints, anxiety and depression. The majority of FMS patients report poor sleep quality, take longer to fall asleep, generally wake up during the night, sleep fewer hours, and usually wake up unrefreshed. Emotional disturbances (i.e., depression, anxiety) are also frequent in FMS. In fact, depression and anxiety disorders have showed a negative impact on the clinical course and work capacity of FMS patients. Cognitive impairments are also a relevant symptom in FMS. The most common complaints among FMS patients are executive function deficits, attention problems, forgetfulness, concentration difficulties, and mental slowness. Regarding the most frequent treatments for FMS, these can be classified as non-psychological and psychological. The former includes analgesic drugs, adjuvant drugs (i.e., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, etc.), nerve blocks, electrostimulation at different levels, infiltrations, etc. The psychological therapies with the most evidence are cognitive-behavioral, acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness.&#x0D; FMS is associated with a severe reduction of health related quality of life and psychosocial impairments. It is necessary to take all FMS symptoms and its relations into account in order to provide a more tailored and effective treatment, as well as, to improve the health related quality of life of FMS patients.",

      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors are disorders involving partial arousal from deep, non–rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in which individuals simultaneously display characteristics of both sleep and wakefulness. Sleepwalking represents the milder form of arousal, while night terrors are distinguished by the intense physiological experiences associated with alarm: screaming, pounding heart, rapid breathing, sweating, extreme terror or panic, and possibly frenzied motor activity. Both sleepwalking and night terrors usually occur during the first 3 hours after falling asleep but may occur at any time of night. They arise from non-REM sleep, generally sleep stages 3 or 4. There may be physical signs of traumatic injuries sustained during episodes of sleepwalking or night terrors. Most patients with sleepwalking/night terrors have a childhood history and/or a family history of these behaviors. There may also be a history of bedwetting.",

It is characterized by complaints in several systems, has early onset and chronic fluctuating course, but without organic substrate. When the duration of symptoms is less than two years or they are less obvious, it is called Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder. Objectives This study reports the case of a female patient, previously healthy and with no psychiatric history, which abruptly presented lush somatic symptoms without organic origin. Case Presentation Case report of a previously healthy woman of 32 years, followed up for 14 months, by a sudden onset frame of profuse diarrhea, tenesmus, fecal incontinence, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss (18 kilos in 2 months), associated with headache and autonomic signs of anxious origin, without clear physical and/or psychogenic trigger. She had only a mild response to drug therapy and excellent improvement in symptoms after psychotherapy. Results Unconscious triggers came to light only after psychotherapy starts, justifying that the magnitude of autonomic somatoform symptoms surpasses the time period established by ICD-10 for Somatization Disorder. Therefore, the rapid resolution did not allow a diagnosis of Somatization Disorder, according to ICD-10. So, it was diagnosed as Undifferentiated Somatoform Disorder. Conclusion It is suggested that the grandeur of clinical symptoms in this case is caused by psychogenic factors.

Apesar destas alterações, a maioria dos idosos está satisfeita com sua vida, e não tem predisposição psicológica para desenvolver transtornos de humor. Entretanto, frente às vicissitudes do envelhecimento, alguns idosos podem apresentar um quadro de depressão maior, transtorno de humor bipolar, ciclotimia, distimia ou simplesmente apresentar “sintomas depressivos clinicamente significativos”, sendo importante a diferenciação entre quadros de início precoce e início tardio, além de se determinar a presença de causas ou complicadores orgânicos. Sabe-se que este adoecimento se deve a uma predisposição psíquica, mas também a uma associação dos sintomas com doenças clínicas, uso crônico de medicamentos e estressores psicossociais, situações mais frequentes nesta população quando comparados aos adultos jovens. As taxas de depressão em pacientes idosos, por exemplo, variam de 3,5% a 7,0% e representam um problema de saúde pública, tendo em vista seu impacto na saúde dos pacientes e a piora da qualidade de vida. O presente artigo tem o objetivo de descrever as características clínicas dos transtornos de humor em idosos, visando à promoção de um diagnóstico precoce, salientando as principais diferenças em relação aos adultos jovens, seja na qualidade ou intensidade dos sintomas, orientando os profissionais de saúde que atendem esta população de pacientes.",

Mental work is the achievement of nature at higher stages of its development, and the human body are not yet developed those optimal reactions that could reliably protect the central nervous system from the surge. As a consequence, this leads to a reduction in the quality of the work performed and the deterioration in labor productivity. In today's congested and stressful world, the fatigue was called “Office Syndrome”. The main reasons leading to its occurrence are being in a confined space more than 8 hours daily, continuous stress associated with work at the computer, the constant stresses and downed power mode. All these factors can lead to many serious diseases. Physical exercises successfully compensate lack of exercise in people whose work is primarily concerned with the mental work in the office. Physical exercises performed in the mode of the day, develop the habit of daily physical fitness, and instill a taste for fitness and wellness classes help to attract more people to lead healthy lifestyles.",

      "title": "Treating Bipolar Mania in the Outpatient Setting: Enlist the Help of Family, Employ Evidence-Based Pharmacologic and Psychotherapeutic Strategies",
      "abstract": "Manic episodes, by definition, are associated with significant social or occupational impairment. (1) Some manic patients are violent or engage in reckless behaviors that can harm themselves or others, such as speeding, disrupting traffic, or playing with fire. When these patients present to a psychiatrist's outpatient practice, involuntary hospitalization might be justified. However, some manic patients, in spite of their elevated, expansive, or irritable mood state, never behave dangerously and might not meet legal criteria for involuntary hospitalization, although these criteria differ from state to state. These patients might see a psychiatrist because manic symptoms such as irritability, talkativeness, and impulsivity are bothersome to their family members but pose no serious danger (Box, page 40). Box Manic, but refusing inpatient treatment Accompanied by her husband and mother, Mrs. W. age 31, is seeking help for insomnia and anxiety. She reports that she has been unable to sleep more than a few hours a night for the last 2 weeks and is having spontaneous panic attacks. Her affect is elevated, she is hyperverbal and loud, and she repeatedly stands up and paces during the interview. Mrs. W's husband tells you that she doesn't sleep. has spent $1,000 in the last week on random items, is calling her friends and her doctors all day and night. and is so easily distracted that she cannot safely take care of their infant. These behaviors are abnormal for Mrs. W when she is well, he reports. but also occurred during a previous manic episode. He says she is doing nothing dangerous and she hasn't voiced any threats of self-harm or violence toward others. Mrs. W's family is concerned about her behavior. Because you are unable to involuntarily commit Mrs. W to a psychiatric hospital. you recommend that she voluntarily check herself into a hospital. Her family strongly supports this idea, but Mrs. W refuses. In this situation, the psychiatrist can strongly encourage the patient to seek voluntary hospitalization or attend a partial hospitalization program. If the patient declines, the psychiatrist is left with 2 choices: initiate treatment in the outpatient setting or refuse to treat the patient and refer to another provider. Treating non-dangerous mania in the outpatient setting is fraught with challenges: * the possibility that the patient's condition will progress to dangerousness * poor adherence to treatment because of the patient's limited insight * the large amount of time required from the psychiatrist and care team to adequately manage the manic episode (eg, time spent with family members, frequent patient visits, and managing communications from the patient). There are no guidelines to assist the office-based practitioner in treating mania in the outpatient setting. When considering dosing and optimal medication combinations for treating mania, clinical trials may be of limited value because most of these studies only included hospitali7ed manic patients. Because of this dearth of knowledge, we provide recommendations based on our review of the literature and from our experience working with manic patients who refuse voluntary hospitalization and could not be hospitali7ed against their will. These recommendations are organized into 3 sections: diagnostic approach, treatment strategy, and family involvement. Diagnostic approach Making a diagnosis of mania might seem straightforward for clinicians who work in inpatient settings; however, mania might not present with classic florid symptoms among outpatients. Patients might have a chief concern of irritability, dysphoria, anxiety, or insomnia, which may lead clinicians to focus initially on non-bipolar conditions. (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] During the interview, it is important to assess for any current DSM-5 symptoms of a manic episode, while being careful not to accept a patient's denial of symptoms. …",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, pain along with respiratory rate, body temperature, hart rate, arterial blood pressure breathing, temperature, pulse and pressure is considered the fifth vital sign. It is often stated that the pain is the most common symptom in clinical practice, a frequent cause of functional impairment of individual inability to function in a normal way, and the most common reason for seeking medical help. In patients who suffer from a long-term feeling of intense pain, efficiency and working ability are reduced and their emotional state is damaged as well. Due to long-term treatment and damaged everyday functioning, these patients often find themselves as social and financial issues. Knowledge about pain goes back far into the history of medical science and says that pain is a symptom of disease and will disappear when the underlying disease is cured. Nowadays, especially the chronic pain is identified as an independent health issue that can and must be treated. The pain is not only the transmission of impulses from the place of injury to the perception area of the brain but a phenomenon that is influenced by factors quantitative, qualitative and sensory, as well as cultural, social and economic. In addition to physical damage, the combination of psychological, social and spiritual component leads us to the concept of total pain definition. Therefore, it is necessary to act to all these causes for complete pain relief. Pain is an important public health issue worldwide. Despite the tremendous progress of science with new technological discoveries and pharmacological agents, pain is still a worldwide problem. It is a basic human right to live without pain, which means that the health care system is responsible to provide help to anyone who feels pain.",

Some experience a general lethargy or lack of interest in formulating and pursuing long-term goals, or in severe cases, even short-term ones. The afflicted individual may neglect his responsibilities, whether to himself, his family, his community or, in the case of religious persons, to God. Feelings frequently associated with this syndrome are guilt and a sense of worthlessness, hopelessness, and sadness. When these feelings reach unbearable levels of intensity the individual may commit suicide. Some therapists go so far as to consider the loss of a sense of meaning, often associated with a weakening of religious commitments, to be the main cause of much of modern man’s unhappiness.

The predisposing basis for functional dysphonia can lie in the constitution of an individual, his/her professional speaking and speech behavior and/or may be personality-based.

      "title": "Separation Anxiety Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common psychiatric disorder of childhood and early adolescence characterized by recurrent excessive and unrealistic fear of separation from home or major attachment figures, typically the mother. SAD can interfere considerably with social, family, and academic functioning and often leads to age‐inappropriate behaviors. SAD should not be confused with separation anxiety, which occurs as a normal stage of development during the first year of life, when infants begin to understand that they are separate from their primary caregiver.",

По мере увеличения продолжительности жизни к возрастным инволютивным изменениям присоединяются различные хронические заболевания, которые в совокупности формируют так называемые гериатрические синдромы. Синдром нарушения передвижения (синдром гипомобильности) является весьма распространенным в возрасте старше 75 лет, так как более 90% опрошенных испытывают затруднения при передвижении, причем они в большей степени характерны для лиц мужского пола. Основными причинами развития синдрома являются когнитивная дисфункция; нарушение тонкой моторики нижних конечностей; последствия перенесенного инсульта; саркопения; тревожно-депрессивный синдром; снижение слуха и зрения; мышечно-костно-суставные боли; одышка; синдром недержания мочи; отсутствие мотивации. Причины развития синдрома также различаются по тендерному признаку. Результаты работы могут быть использованы при составлении программ медико-социальной реабилитации людей старческого возраста.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenien treten weltweit mit einer Lebenszeitprävalenz von etwa 1 % auf. Wieso ist eine teilweise erblich bedingte und oft schwer verlaufende Erkrankung so weit verbreitet und tritt relativ häufig auf? Eine mögliche Erklärung besagt, dass es neben den Krankheitssymptomen auch Auswirkungen der Disposition oder der Erkrankung selbst gibt, die sich - zumindest bei Familienangehörigen oder nur leicht Erkrankten - positiv auswirken. Ein möglicher Grund ist das Fehlen der latenten Inhibition bisher unwichtiger Reize bei schizophrenen Patienten: Wird in einer Versuchsanordnung eine Vielzahl von Reizen präsentiert, von denen aber nur ein einziger als Hinweisreiz fungiert, auf den reagiert werden muss, um eine Belohnung zu erzielen, filtern Gesunde die unwichtigen Reize schnell aus. Wechselt aber unangekündigt die Versuchsanordnung und ein bisher unwichtiger Reiz ist nun der Hinweisreiz, dann brauchen Gesunde meist recht lange, um den Reiz zu entdecken. Von latenter Inhibition wird gesprochen, weil Gesunde sehr viel länger brauchen, den Reiz zu entdecken, wenn er bereits vorhanden, aber bisher unwichtig war, als wenn er neu in der Situation auftritt. Die bisherige Bedeutungslosigkeit des Reizes „hemmt” also seine Wahrnehmung als Hinweisreiz. Anders ist dies bei schizophrenen Patienten: Sie hemmen die Wahrnehmung des bisher unwichtigen Reizes offenbar weniger effektiv, so dass sie ihn schneller erkennen können, wenn er beim Wechsel der Versuchsbedingungen zum Hinweisreiz wird. Zwar brauchen sie insgesamt oft deutlich länger als Gesunde, um die Versuchsanordnung zu bewältigen, gemessen an ihrer üblichen Reaktionszeit gelingt ihnen der Wechsel auf die neue Reizkonstellation aber schneller als den Gesunden [2]. Schizophrene Menschen können also in unüblichen oder neuartigen Situationen beobachten, dass ein vermeintlich wohl bekanntes Zeichen seine Bedeutung ändert und dies einen Hinweis auf das Verständnis der Situation geben könnte - vielleicht ein Grund dafür, dass psychotische Erfahrungen viele Künstler zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts stark beeinflusst haben, die die Situation des Menschen in der Industriegesellschaft neu verstehen wollten [3].",

In generalized anxiety disorder, neurotic fear appears in the form of fears, expectations, tension, with nothing specifically uncomprehendingly crying anticipation, worry, poor concentration, psychic and physical fatigue, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, sense of near accident etc. Traumatic events in the life of the individual are often referred to as potential relevant factors in the occurrence of psychological disorders.

Only two direct relationships are seen: the acute confusional states due to the age-linked decline in stress resistance; and the neurotic reactions due to the diminished capacity for rapid and adequate adjustment to the more subtle but chronic sociopsychological changes the aged individual is so frequently exposed to in our society. The chronic dementing processes of the senium, senile and arteriosclerotic dementia, are more likely to occur at an advanced age, but apparently are not the final outcome of cerebral and/or cerebrovascular ageing, although the ageing process seems to favour their phenotypical manifestation. The functional psychoses may occur at an advanced age but are not directly related to the process of ageing.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual symptoms include a constellation of mood, behavioral, and physical indications that occur in a cyclic pattern prior to menstruation and then wane off after the menstrual period in women of reproductive age. Most females have only mild discomfort, and symptoms do not interfere with their personal, social, or professional live; however, 5% to 8% of women have moderate-to-severe symptoms that can cause significant distress and functional impairment.Although symptoms have been recognized for a long time, the diagnostic criteria have been specified only recently. The nomenclature for disorders has changed significantly over the years, evolving from moodiness in the 18th century to premenstrual tension in the early part of 19th century to finally premenstrual in the 1950s. While some discomfort prior to menses is quite common, syndrome (PMS) includes the subset of women who experience symptoms that are severe enough to impact daily activities and functioning. Late luteal dysphoric disorder (LLDD), now known as dysphoric disorder (PMDD), accounts for the most severe form of PMS with the greatest impairment of women’s functioning and perceived quality of life, often prompting them to seek treatment.Currently, PMDD is listed in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) as a separate entity under Depressive disorders, with the criteria for diagnosis as follows:Criterion A - At least 5 of the following 11 symptoms (including at least 1 of the first 4 listed) should be present: Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being “keyed up” or “on edge” Marked affective lability Persistent and marked anger or irritability or increased interpersonal conflicts Decreased interest in usual activities (eg, work, school, friends, and hobbies) Subjective sense of difficulty in concentrating Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy Marked change in appetite, overeating, or specific food cravings Hypersomnia or insomnia A subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control Other physical symptoms, such as breast tenderness or swelling, headaches, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of bloating, or weight gain. Criterion B - symptoms severe enough to interfere significantly with social, occupational, sexual, or scholastic functioning.Criterion C - symptoms discretely related to the menstrual cycle and must not merely represent an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, dysthymic disorder, or a personality disorder (although the symptoms may be superimposed on those of these disorders).Criterion D - criteria A, B, and C confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least 2 consecutive symptomatic menstrual cycles. The diagnosis may be made provisionally before this confirmation.Women with moderate-to-severe PMS or PMDD experience more quality-of-life detriments, work-productivity losses, and incur greater healthcare costs than women with no or only mild symptoms.",

      "abstract": "A share of older persons among the general population has been increasing. Mental health is the most important determinant of health status of older people. Anxiety in later life is the most common mental disease. Various diseases and symptoms often occur at the advanced age. In older adults, anxiety disorders are associated with an increased risk of comorbidities. Although insomnia is not a normal part of the ageing process, its prevalence increases with age. Many older people experience dissatisfaction with the quantity and quality of sleep, even if they get enough sleep. Ageing is associated with some changes in parameters of sleep architecture and continuity. There are several demographic, psychosocial, biological, and behavioural factors that may contribute to insomnia later in life. Older people are subject to greater risk for the physical and mental consequences of insomnia. Patients with long-term insomnia usually experience anxiety and depression. Evidence suggests that there is a complex bidirectional relationship between insomnia and anxiety in the elderly. Sleep disturbances are part of the anxiety disorder pattern. Therefore, healthcare workers must obtain comprehensive information about the health and sleep status of older people to correctly diagnose insomnia, anxiety, and identify potential correlates of these disorders. Taking a careful and complete medical history and performing a thorough physical examination is the most important aspect of their evaluation. If insomnia and anxiety are diagnosed in later life, therapy should include non-drug and drug treatments, taking into account possible side effects.",

      "title": "Sleep and the Athlete",
      "abstract": "Adequate sleep hygiene is increasingly recognized as a crucial part of athlete recovery, avoidance of overtraining or burnout, and optimization of health. Sleep impacts metabolic regulation and homeostasis and serves a vital restorative function (1). Sleep regulation occurs through an intrinsic sleep-wake cycle of optimal duration, coupled with a circadian rhythm that is influenced by environmental exposures, such as light and darkness. Other factors that affect sleep include exercise, diet/nutrition, supplements/stimulants, medications, travel, social/electronic media, and mental/physical health (2–4). In general, exercise favorably affects sleep quality and quantity (5). High-performance athletes, particularly adolescent and young adult athletes, are routinely exposed to greater physical, psychological, and neuromuscular stressors that require a delicate balance of recovery, including appropriate sleep (5). Athletes are at higher risk for sleep impairment for several reasons. Sleep deprivation is the most common sleep disorder, in general (6,7), and the frequency of both early morning and/or evening training sessions can decrease sleep duration, resulting in acute and cumulative sleep deprivation. A minimum of 7 h of sleep per day is ideal for optimal health in adults; adolescents require a minimum of 8 h of sleep per day (6,7) (Table). Traveling across time zones for competitions can have negative effects on circadian rhythms, particularly west to east travel. In general, it is prudent to allow at least 1 d for each time zone crossed for full resolution of jet lag symptoms (8,9). Additional studies have shown that between 50% and 80% of all athletes experience poor sleep quality during periods of heavy training and particularly on the nights before and after competition (5,10–12). Poor sleep quality and quantity can negatively affect cognitive and physical performance, perceived exertion, injury risk, and mental health (2–4). All of the above, along with increased pain, decreased task execution tolerance, and decreased cognitive and motor function (e.g., increased reaction times), are consistently correlated with increased injury risk in athletes (13–16). Daytime restorative napping, a common strategy that can reduce sleep debt, can improve short-term memory, alertness, and accuracy during reaction-time tests and should be incorporated, when necessary. Other sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent bedtimes, avoiding evening light exposure from technology and electronic devices, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining adequate hydration, and having a relaxation-focused bedtime routine (17,18).Table: National Sleep Foundation Sleep Duration Recommendations byAge (23).Athletes with mental health disorders and sport-related concussion (SRC) often display symptoms of disordered sleep. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in concussed athletes with up to 50% reporting sleep-related issues, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and impaired sleep quality. Sleep disturbance may hinder concussion recovery and can worsen psychiatric illness, memory, and social functioning (19). Unfortunately, inadequate sleep the night before neurocognitive concussion testing can lead to increased symptom scores, impeding return to play (20). Sleep quality and mental health impact each other (21). Sleep impairment can lead to increased stress, negative mood, and exacerbation of mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Conversely, the presence of mental illness can cause sleep disturbances. Optimizing sleep appears to improve overall mental health (21,22). Compensatory strategies, restorative approaches, and cognitive rehabilitation should be incorporated into comprehensive treatment plans for SRC patients and athletes with mental health disorders. Good sleep hygiene that includes adequate sleep duration, quality, and timing appears to be a crucial factor in athlete health, performance, adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention. Athletes must increase their awareness of sleep importance and develop strategies to maintain proper sleep regulation throughout training and competition.",

      "abstract": "Las emociones son parte de la vida cotidiana. Con el objetivo de alcanzar aquello nos proponemos (incluido mantener el bienestar), las personas utilizamos diferentes estrategias de regulacion emocional. La regulacion emocional es el proceso por el que tratamos de modificar la expresion de una emocion ante una determinada situacion. Existe un creciente interes en la investigacion de la regulacion de la emocion debido a sus implicaciones para la salud fisica y mental. Las personas con fibromialgia sufren dolor cronico generalizado que suele ir acompanado de una gran variedad de sintomas, entre los que destacan la fatiga persistente, rigidez muscular, sueno no reparador y dificultades cognitivas (fibrofog) en la atencion, la memoria o la concentracion. Sintomas de alta intensidad afectiva y de ansiedad son muy frecuentes en la fibromialgia, y los deficits en la regulacion de la emocion en pacientes con este sindrome son bien conocidos. Con una prevalencia mundial de 2 a 4% y en ausencia de un tratamiento curativo, esta constelacion de sintomas mencionada afecta gravemente la vida diaria de los pacientes. El impacto en el area personal, economica y social es dramatico. El Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) mide la regulacion de la emocion con base cognitiva (aquello que pensamos cuando surge una emocion ante una situacion en la vida). El CERQ captura nueve estrategias de regulacion de la emocion: Autoculparse, Aceptacion, Rumiacion, Centrarse en lo positivo, Focalizacion en planes, Reevaluacion positiva, Poner en perspectiva, Catastrofizacion y Culpar a otros. Estas estrategias de pueden ayudar a las personas a regular sus emociones, de una manera Adaptativa o Menos adaptativa, facilitando u obstaculizando el manejo de la situacion. En este sentido, el uso de estrategias regulatorias Menos adaptativas se concibe como un factor transdiagnostico de vulnerabilidad psicopatologica. En esta tesis doctoral, examinamos las propiedades psicometricas de la version en espanol del CERQ, cuyo formato fue adaptado (items agrupados por dimension) considerando los sintomas de la fibromialgia. Con este fin, recopilamos datos clinicos y de CERQ de 231 pacientes con fibromialgia que participaron en un ensayo aleatorizado y controlado realizado en el Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Deu (St. Boi de Llobregat, Espana). Los analisis de datos apoyaron las propiedades psicometricas del CERQ en pacientes con fibromialgia y confirmaron la estructura de nueve factores, una consistencia interna adecuada y una superposicion minima entre las subescalas, coincidiendo con estudios previos realizados con muestras clinicas y no clinicas. Ademas, los analisis de correlacion y regresion apoyaron la validez de construccion del instrumento CERQ. En resumen, en este trabajo llegamos a la conclusion de que la version adaptada del CERQ es un instrumento solido y util para evaluar la regulacion de la emocion cognitiva en la fibromialgia. Como resultado principal de esta tesis doctoral, tenemos una medida validada empiricamente para evaluar la frecuencia de uso de nueve estrategias de regulacion de la emocion cognitiva en pacientes con fibromialgia, que generalmente se caracterizan por dificultades de regulacion de la emocion. Los estudios futuros que utilicen un diseno longitudinal podran abordar algunos aspectos psicometricos pendientes del CERQ en pacientes con fibromialgia, como la estabilidad en el tiempo (fiabilidad test-retest) y la sensibilidad al cambio.",

      "abstract": "Veterans of all war eras have a high rate of chronic disease, mental health disorders, and chronic multi-symptom illnesses (CMI).(1-3) Many veterans report symptoms that affect multiple biological systems as opposed to isolated disease states. Standard medical treatments often target isolated disease states such as headaches, insomnia, or back pain and at times may miss the more complex, multisystem dysfunction that has been documented in the veteran population. Research has shown that veterans have complex symptomatology involving physical, cognitive, psychological, and behavioral disturbances, such as difficult to diagnose pain patterns, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, or neurocognitive dysfunction.(2-4) Meditation and acupuncture are each broad-spectrum treatments designed to target multiple biological systems simultaneously, and thus, may be well suited for these complex chronic illnesses. The emerging literature indicates that complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) approaches augment standard medical treatments to enhance positive outcomes for those with chronic disease, mental health disorders, and CMI.(5-12.)",

      "title": "Alteraciones estructurales de las regiones cerebrales sexuales tras empleo de paroxetina versus agomelatina",
      "abstract": "El estado de animo del individuo es un tono vital interno dominante y mantenido, que influye en el comportamiento de la persona y en su percepcion del mundo. Este puede verse normal o eutimico, elevado o hipertimico; bajo o deprimido. Las alteraciones de la esfera afectiva son un grupo de afecciones clinicas que se caracterizan por la perdida de ese sentido del control y por el sentimiento subjetivo de un gran malestar. (SINTOMAS) Los pacientes con animo deprimido experimentan una perdida de energia y del interes, sentimientos de culpa, dificultades de concentracion, perdida del apetito, pensamientos de muerte… entre otros sintomas. Los trastornos del espectro depresivo, cuentan actualmente con una extensa farmacopea, centrados fundamentalmente por los psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos. Tanto el propio deterioro animico asi como su tratamiento pueden traer consigo un sintoma adicional, la disfuncion sexual (DS). Los Inhibidores Selectivos de Recaptacion de Serotonina (ISRS) provocan una amplia variedad de DS, desde las mas habituales como descenso en la libido, disminucion de la excitacion y retardo en el orgasmo, a otras mas anecdoticas como priapismo (en pene y clitoris), anestesia genital, anestesia peneana, ereccion, orgasmos y eyaculacion espontaneos, aumento de la libido, orgasmos dolorosos… (F. Arias et al, 2000). A pesar de todo, en las fichas tecnicas, la incidencia de la disfuncion sexual se establece entre 2-16%, muy inferior a la estimada en la practica real (Montejo AL, 2001). A modo de resumen, podemos concluir que existe bibliografia que justifica la DS provocada por los antidepresivos (concretamente los ISRS) en seres humanos, no obstante con las limitaciones: 1) Los pacientes con Trastorno del espectro depresivo pueden presentar en si mismo DS como sintoma de la enfermedad. 2) Los pacientes pueden presentar comorbilidad que de lugar a DS. 3) La infraestimacion de la DS debido a la dificultad que supone recoger en una historia clinica reglada la sexualidad como ritmo biologico esencial. Es por eso que creemos que es esencial dar un paso mas y buscar a nivel biologico, que es lo que se modifica a nivel estructural en la esfera, tras el empleo de psicofarmacos del grupo de los antidepresivos, concretamente comparando un ISRS con un antidepresivo melatoninergico. Para ello creemos que es una herramienta muy util el estudio anatomopatologico del Sistema Nervioso Central de animales de experimentacion. Trabajando sobre las areas cerebrales implicadas en la sexualidad. Nuestra hipotesis de trabajo se basa en que la Paroxetina produce disfuncion sexual y la Agomelatina no, por tanto las regiones cerebrales estudiadas en los animales a los que se les administro Paroxetina mostraran diferencias con respecto a los animales a los que se les administro Agomelatina. La descripcion de dichas diferencias podria dar lugar a las bases que expliquen de forma estructural la disfuncion sexual producida por un ISRS. Para la realizacion de nuestro trabajo hemos utilizado como animal de experimentacion un total de 20 ratas de la raza Wistar que al inicio del tratamiento tenian aproximadamente 50 dias (postpuberales); y un peso aproximado de 150 gr. Esta camada de ratas se divide en 4 grupos: dos experimentales y dos controles. 1) Animales del Grupo control 1 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. No se administra ninguna sustancia. 2) Animales del Grupo control 2 Formado por 4 animales. Una jaula. Se admInistra HMC. 3) Animales del Grupo experimental 1 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Paroxetina. 4) Animales del Grupo experimental 2 Formado por 6 animales. Dos jaulas de tres animales cada una. Se administra Agomelatina. A todos los animales se les expuso a un ciclo de luz-oscuridad de 12 horas a traves de un punto de luz y un temporizador y se les administro las sustancias correspondientes a lo largo de 28 dias naturales. Se realizo un pesaje de los animales en tres momentos del estudio: al inicio, en el dia 14 y en el dia 28. Pesamos la jaula con animales y sin animales, hallamos la diferencia y hacemos un promedio del peso. A lo largo de los 28 dias se realiza un diario de conducta: conductas extranas, psicomotricidad, subida en patas traseras, olfateo general, olfateo anal, intromisiones, etc. Tras 28 dias de administracion de las sustancias; se procede al sacrificio e inclusion de muestras. Tincion mediante la tecnica inmunohistoquimica con los anticuerpos murinos: • Anticuerpo Tiroxina-Hidroxilasa (TH): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Receptor alfa de Estrogenos (RE-a): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/300 • Anticuerpo Oxitocina (OXT): es un anticuerpo policlonal de conejo. Concentrada a 1/500 RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION (DIARIO DE CONDUCTA) En el grupo de las ratas a las que se les administro Paroxetina se produjo un importante incremento de peso en comparacion con el grupo al que se le administro Agomelatina. Las primeras doblaron su peso y las segundas experimentaron un incremento del 40% del peso corporal aproximadamente. Estos cambios de peso dieron lugar al reajuste de dosis. En el grupo de Paroxetina llamaba la atencion el intenso apetito que mostraban a partir del dia 10 del estudio. En comparacion con los otros grupos de estudio mostraban una importante voracidad. Ademas mostraban un incremento de la actividad motora que se mostraba en subidas sobre patas traseras y olfateo general. A pesar de todo esto era un grupo de ratas muy colaboradoras, que no mostraban resistencia ni a ser manipuladas ni a la administracion del farmaco. Respecto al grupo de Agomelatina mantenian un apetito estable. La psicomotricidad solo se veia incrementada en el momento de la manipulacion, que comenzaban a dar vueltas alrededor de la jaula. Se mostraban parcialmente colaboradoras a la manipulacion y a la administracion del farmaco, con una conducta ambivalente e imprevisible, en ningun momento agresiva. Los grupos control mantuvieron un apetito estable, no sufrieron incremento ni descenso de peso. Respecto a la psicomotricidad no hay hallazgos destacables. RESULTADOS FRUTO DE LA OBSERVACION A MICROSCOPIO OPTICO .-Sistema dopaminergico: descenso marcado y global en todo el sistema dopaminergicos (desde origenes hasta destinos) en los animales tratadados con Paroxetina comparado con los animales tratados con Agomelatina y los animales control; que fue objetivado mediante el tratamiento estadistico de los datos obtenidos a traves del programa de procesamiento digital ImageJ. .-Sistema oxcitocinergico: no se observan diferencias significativas entre los grupos de estudio .-Sistema receptor alfa de estrogeno: se observa descenso de RE alfa en la pars tuberalis de los animales tratados con Agomelatina.",

      "title": "Somatization",
      "abstract": "Abstract An evaluator's failure to recognize illness behavior and to adjust for its effect on symptom presentation can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding impairment or disability; here the authors review the associated phenomena of somatization, disorders that arise from it, and factors that contribute to somatization. Somatization is an individual's unconscious use of the body or bodily symptoms for psychological purposes or psychological gain. As the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, notes, somatization is a “tendency to experience and report somatic complaints (physical symptoms) in response to psychosocial stress and seek health care services for them.” The AMA Guides also advises evaluators that “exclusion or inclusion of somatization disorder, factitious disorder, and/or malingering must be done with care.” A table lists developmental factors that may dispose to somatization (eg, somatizers are present in the family of origin, or coping mechanisms other than illness behavior are absent or unacceptable); a second table compares disorders that may involve somatization. Somatization is prevalent in clinical practice and is likely to occur with equal, or higher, frequency in the evaluation setting. The presence of somatization distorts symptom presentation and can exert a confounding effect on impairment assessment methodologies that rely on the accuracy of patients’ self-presentations.",

      "title": "Transforming Anxiety: The HeartMath Solution for Overcoming Fear and Worry and Creating Serenity",
      "abstract": "Nothing can destroy health and quality of life faster than chronic anxiety, that vague feeling of unease and distress that something, somehow is hopelessly wrong. Unfortunately, problems with anxiety, common before, are steadily on the rise. Anxiety disorders have always been the most common psychological problems, but new reports suggest that nearly 25 percent of Americans at any given time suffer from some form of anxiety. In response to this growing problem, the scientists at the Institute of HeartMath have adapted their revolutionary techniques into a fast and simple program that anyone can use to break free from anxiety once and for all. At the core of the HeartMath method of emotional regulation is the idea that, by focusing on positive feelings such as appreciation, care, or compassion, anyone can create dramatic changes in his or her heart rhythms. These changes precipitate a series of neural, hormonal, and biochemical events that dissipate stress and anger and lead to greater well-being. The benefits from using this system are remarkable and far-reaching: blood pressure drops, stress hormone levels fall, immune system activity increases, and anti-aging hormone levels rise. Through its interactive learning system, this book teaches you how to use the HeartMath method, enabling you to see and experience in real time how thoughts and emotions affect your heart rhythms. It shows you how to engage your heart to bring emotion, body, and mind into balance, and helps you stay in a zone of focused clarity, optimal health, and high performance. Changes brought about through this method are fast-acting and long-lasting - the perfect antidote to our chaotic and anxiety-provoking lives.",

      "abstract": "Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) was originally described as a syndrome in which depression developed during autumn or winter and remitted the following spring or summer.1,,2 Since then two subtypes of SAD have been defined in the scientific literature: winter SAD and summer SAD, the former being by far the more frequent.2,,3 Most winter SAD patients have ‘atypical’ depressive symptoms such as increased sleep duration, increased appetite and weight, and carbohydrate craving. Patients with winter SAD may experience a reversal of their winter symptoms in summer: mild hypomania, elevated mood, increased libido, social activity and energy, and decreased sleep requirements, appetite and weight. Seasonality, the tendency to experience seasonal changes in mood and behaviour, can be viewed as a dimension, ranging from those who show no seasonal changes to those who show more extreme changes with the seasons. Seasonal changes of mood and behaviour are common throughout the population.4–,6 A survey in the Washington area found that approximately 4% of the population have winter SAD and over 10% more have sub‐syndromal winter SAD.4 Some 27% of respondents reported that changes with the seasons were a problem for them. Another survey, in New York City, indicated approximately 6% with potential clinical severity, 18% reporting milder symptoms that were bothersome, and 35% noting symptoms but without complaint.6 Thus, many people experience mild analogues of winter SAD. A considerable number of studies by researchers around the world have demonstrated that light therapy (daily scheduled exposure to artificial light) is an effective treatment for winter SAD.1,6–,10\n\nAn internal pacemaker that matches internal rhythms to the 24‐h day drives circadian rhythms.9–,13 In humans, the master circadian pacemaker is the bilaterally paired suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus. …",

      "abstract": "Depression (e.g. depressive episode) is a pathological affective disorder characterized by several emotional, physical, behavioural and cognitive symptoms, which vary in duration, and are characterized by progressive evolution. Over time, they lead to an important alteration of daily activities (domestic, social, professional) of the person. At present, with life expectancy continuing increasing all over the world and with 10% of the total world population being over 65, the incidence of neuro-degenerative and affective disorders becomes an important concern for specialists. Old age is accompanied by important changes in the person’s self perception and perception of the environment; although depression in the elderly is not different from depression in young age, clinical data have evidentiated a particular type of depressive disorder related to old age, characterized by: motivational deficiency, low concentration and attention capacity, psychomotor impairment, which are frequently accompanied by several organic degenerative diseases. Many times, depression of the elderly is underdiagnosed and remains insufficiently treated. Drug therapy should be associated with psychotherapy, in order to improve patient compliance and motivation. The antidepressants existing nowadays in therapy are more selective and with fewer side effects than the first generation antidepressants: serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, sertralin), serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (as venlafaxine) are preferred, taking into account the multiple health conditions that may coexist in the elderly patient.",

      "title": "Managing drug-induced psychosis",
      "abstract": "AbstractSubstance-induced psychosis is a secondary psychotic disorder resulting from drug abuse, characterized by one or more psychotic episodes. Drug-induced psychosis is expected to resolve after a 30-day period of sobriety, however, individuals with this condition are more likely to develop severe drug addiction. Compared to primary psychosis, participants with drug-induced psychosis exhibit poorer family history of psychotic diseases, higher insight, fewer positive and negative symptoms, more depressive symptoms, and greater anxiety. Substance-induced psychosis is strongly associated with the emergence of bipolar illness or schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with an increased chance of developing schizophrenia at a younger age. Episodes of self-harm after substance-induced psychosis are strongly linked to an elevated likelihood of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effective treatment involves ruling out emergencies, investigating underlying causes, and addressing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Management includes dynamic assessment, intervention, and vigilant monitoring in cases of suicidal behaviour. Antipsychotics may be used for short term, with gradual discontinuation when a person is in a stable condition. Relapse prevention strategies, both medication and non-medication-based, are crucial in long-term management. Conversion rates to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be as high as one in three individuals, with cannabis users and those with early-onset substance abuse at the highest risk.Keywords: Drug-induced psychosispsychotic disordersbipolar disorderschizophreniarisk Authors' contributionAll authors participated in all stages of the review.Disclosure statementLB worked as a scientific consultant for Libbs and Jansen.

Il s'agit d'une atteinte du muscle ciliaire et/ou a une mydriase par stimulation du nerf sympathique ou par inhibition du systeme parasympathique. -­ Un spasme d'accommodation a l'origine d'une myopie transitoire. Cela s'explique par la contraction permanente du muscle ciliaire et s'associe, en cas d'origine medicamenteuse, a un myosis par stimulation excessive du systeme parasympathique. Les medicaments parasympathomimetiques induisent ainsi un myosis actif, et les medicaments parasympatholytiques une mydriase passive. A l'inverse, les medicaments sympathomimetiques alpha-­adrenergiques provoquent une mydriase active, et les medicaments sympatholytiques alpha-­adrenergiques un myosis passif. Le but de ce travail a ete de faire l'etat des lieux bibliographique le plus large possible des medicaments a l'origine des troubles de l'accommodation. Cela permet d'apprehender les familles therapeutiques couramment decrites comme pourvoyeuses de troubles de l'accommodation et d'utilisation tres diverse (antihistaminiques, neuroleptiques, antiparkinsoniens, anticancereux, antidiabetiques, etc…), mais aussi d'autres molecules moins decrites. Le pharmacien est un acteur important dans la prise en charge des patients. Il permet, grâce a ses conseils, d'accompagner le patient en matiere d'effets indesirables et de lui signaler leur survenue eventuelle en matiere de vision. Afin de mieux maitriser les risques de troubles de l'accommodation, le pharmacien doit garder une formation continue, et etre vigilant quant aux risques que comporte chaque molecule commercialisee.",

Sytuacja staje sie\njeszcze trudniejsza, jeśli jest to choroba psychiczna i do tego przewlekla; choroba moze stanowic obciązenie, a nawet przeciązenie nie\ntylko dla samego chorego, lecz rowniez dla jego bliskich.\n Cel pracy. Glownym celem pracy byla ocena zaburzen nastroju o obrazie depresyjnym u opiekunow pacjentow przewlekle chorych na\nschizofrenie.\n Material i metody. Badania przeprowadzono wśrod 100 doroslych osob opiekujących sie w sposob ciągly czlonkiem rodziny chorym na\nprzewleklą schizofrenie. W badaniach wykorzystano Skale Depresji Becka.\n Wyniki. Osoby badane doświadczyly zaburzen emocjonalnych (np. obnizenia nastroju), intelektualnych (np. zaburzenia koncentracji uwagi),\nczesto wystepowaly u nich zaburzenia snu. Badani byli narazeni na przewlekly stres, a w wiekszości sami korzystali z porad profesjonalistow.\nNa podstawie badan stwierdzono, ze opiekunowie sami doświadczali dolegliwości somatycznych i psychicznych, opiekując sie najblizszymi\nod dluzszego czasu.\nWedlug Skali Depresji Becka stopien depresji umiarkowanie ciezkiej wystepowal u 60% badanych, depresji lagodnej - u 28%, bardzo\nciezkiej - u 7% badanych. Nasilenie depresji wystepowalo u 95% ankietowanych, a tylko 5% nie wykazywalo objawow.\nWśrod objawow psychofizycznych dominowaly najcześciej: poczucie niewydolności (49%), niezdolnośc do pracy (43%), brak satysfakcji\n(35%), drazliwośc (35%), wolanie o pomoc (34%), obnizenie nastroju (33%).

Any case of decline can be explained on one of four bases. 1. A tree may decline primarily as the result of chronic irritation by a single agent. 2. A tree may decline because of damage by secondary agents after an injurious event such as defoliation or major wounding. The same agents would not cause decline in an uninjured tree, and the injury alone would not cause decline. 3. Chronic irritation by one or more agents may diminish the tolerance or resistance of a tree to another agent that then incites decline. Various factors including those that predisposed the tree and incited decline may then contribute to further decline. 4. Trees of similar age growing in groups tend to display group behaviour including premature senescence (synchronous cohort senescence) in response to stress.",

      "abstract": "This is the summary of the lecture that the author, as a clinical psychiatrist, gave to the Japanese researchers of basic psychopharmacology who are not involved in clinical medicine. I. The author considers the problems of psychotropic drugs in Japan in 2 categories: those unique to Japan (1-5) and those related to psychotropic drugs in general (6-9). 1. \"Arbitrary\" administration (i. e., the prescription is different with each psychiatrist, therefore standardization is necessary). 2. Polypharmacy (i. e., unreasonable combination is made). 3. Many different drugs with similar effect (therefore, new drugs should be controlled). 4. \"Stereotype\" of doctor's prescription for long-term use. 5. Limited prescription due to health insurances. 6. Doubtful effect on long-term prognosis of chronic schizophrenics. 7. Psycho-social burden of patients taking drugs continuously. 8. Undesirable effects like prolongation of depressive episode, lowered mental activity, or blunting of affect. 9. Side effects such as dependence, tardive dyskinesia, malignant syndrome, or teratogenecity. II. Tardive dyskinesea, malignant syndrome and teratogenecity are explained in detail. III. The author expresses the wishes for future development of psychotropic drugs as follows: 1. Good balance of \"effect\", \"side effect\", and \"price\" of clinical drugs. 2. Introduction of safe long-acting drugs which promote social rehabilitation of mental patients. 3. Development of more specifically effective drugs. 4. Convenient way of measurement of drug serum level. 5. Contribution to understanding of pathogenesis of mental disorders through researches on effects and side effects of drugs. Finally, the author stresses the necessity of more cooperation between clinical and basic medicine.",

      "title": "The Physiological Aspects of the Stress",
      "abstract": "Generally the term stress refers to experiences of endangering one’s physical or psy­chological wellbeing. Physiological stress refers to bodily adaptation processes and the maintenance of body’s balance. Selye defined stress as a function of elevated corticosteroid levels and used the term stress to refer to the effects of any agent that threatens the homeostasis of the organism. The term allostasis which refers to the body’s ability to achieve stability. The allostatic load is assumed to be caused by frequent stress, lack of adaptation to repeated stress, and inability to shut down the allostatic response when the stress is over and inadequate response or dysfunction of the stress systems  Thus, psychological stress can be defined as a discrepancy between personal capacities and environmental demands. Somatic stress symptoms are related to both physiological and psychological stress. The different types of stressors are likely to elicit divergent stress reactions. The multifaceted nature of stress and various sources of stress must also be taken into account. It is important to define the stress precisely in epidemiological studies. Consequently, stress has been determined here in terms of stressful life events, experience of chronic stress, experimentally induced mental and physiological stress reactions and work stress. The work stress models that are presented here have been used extensively in studies of occupational and cardiovascular health. The inheritance of stress refers here to an innate temperament. Rationale is as follows: temperament a) has a biological basis, b) is highly inherited, and c) explains what one experiences as a stress and partly determines what the health consequences are. The common assumption in several temperament theories is that temperament plays important role in moderating stress. In the end we presented the comparative analysis between the eustress and distress.",

      "abstract": "Chronic mania is a mental health disorder that has been described by various psychiatrists in the past but currently is not a part of nosology. Robust epidemiological data for chronic mania are lacking with regard to its prevalence and clinical features. The present case report is of a 48-year-old male with a six-year history of mood and psychotic symptoms, based on which differential diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder (manic type), schizophrenia, and mania with psychotic symptoms (with chronic course) were made. The diagnosis of chronic mania was confirmed considering the predominance of fluctuating mood symptoms along with psychotic symptoms, lack of remission, and chronic course of illness. Antipsychotics were initially started for six weeks, to which the patient demonstrated a minimal response. A mood stabilizer was added to the regimen, leading to significant improvement, and the patient was discharged. According to existing literature, patients with chronic mania present with severe illness, the presence of psychotic symptoms, and socio-occupational impairment, which was also noticed in this case. The prevalence of chronic mania among patients with bipolar disorder is approximately 13-15%, which constitutes a significant proportion of known mental illnesses. Therefore, chronic mania should be added as a distinct clinical entity in the existing nosological systems.",

Die Beeintraechtigungen der AD werden in die Auspraegungsgrade leicht, mittel und schwer unterschieden, denen eine Praedemenzphase von etwa fuenf bis sieben Jahren mit leichten, teils schwer erfassbaren kognitiven Beeintraechtigungen vorausgeht. Die Symptome bei fortschreitender Erkrankung werden im Einzelnen beschrieben. Bei mittleren und schweren Auspraegungsgraden sind die Betroffenen nicht mehr in der Lage, ein Fahrzeug sicher zu fuehren. In der Praedemenzphase und im Fruehstadium ist es fraglich, inwieweit und wie lange die Fahrfaehigkeit ohne erhoehtes Risiko erhalten bleibt. Der individuelle Krankheitsverlauf fuehrt dazu, dass die Fahreignung unterschiedlich lange erhalten bleibt. Nicht alleine die Leistungsdefizite sind entscheidend, sondern die Faehigkeit zur Kompensation und deren Aufrechterhaltung. Im Abschnitt ueber Rechtsvorschriften und Richtlinien werden die Begutachtungs-Leitlinien zur Kraftfahrereignung zitiert. Danach ist derjenige nicht in der Lage, ein Kraftfahrzeug zu fuehren, der unter einer ausgepraegten Demenz leidet. Dabei ist der Nachweis fuer ausgepraegte Leistungsmaengel unklar, da nicht sichergestellt ist, ob und wie lange Defizite kompensiert werden koennen. Die Leistungsueberpruefungen mittels neuropsychologischer Testungen korrelieren bei aelteren Menschen nur gering mit den Ergebnissen des praktischen Fahrverhaltens. In kritischen Faellen ist eine Fahrverhaltensprobe anzuraten, in der die Faehigkeit zur Kompensation erfasst wird, die entscheidend zur Erhaltung der Fahrfaehigkeit ist.

      "abstract": "The occurance of psychic changes in the midwifery period is increasingly common. Mental changes can manifest as mild difficulties, but also as serious psychiatric disorders that require treatment. Baby blues, postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis and anxiety disorders, are changes that can occur in the puerperium period. The mildest ant the most common difficulty is baby blues or postpartum grief, which last for a short time and passes without consequence for the mther and her child. In the most cases treatment is not required, support from the environment and the family is enough. Postpartum depression is a serious disorder that needs to be treated.\r\n Simptoms of postpartum depression are feelings of sadness, loss of interest, insomnia, restlessness, etc. Treatment includes pharmacoterapy for alternative procedures.\r\n Postpartum psychosis is rare but the most serious form of postpartum disorders and can have very serious consequences for the mother and her child (even fatal outcome is possible). It is treated with pharmacotherapy and alternative methods, but sometimes requires hospitalization in the department of psychiatry. Anxiety disorders are a group of disorders, that is divided into panic disorders, obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress disorders and other specific phobias. The cause of anxiety disorders are mainly genetic factors, unwanted pregnancies, unprepared mothers for the role of motherhood and sudden hormonal changes. A large role in the prevention of mental health problems is played by a health visitor whose task is to educate women and their families, before and after birth and contribute with advice and skills to overcome postpartum stress and inital adjustment. During the preparation of the final survey was conducted trought social network Facebook („MeĊimurske mame i trudnice“, etc.) collected was 134 responses from April to May 2019. Results have shown 67,9% of participants did not have any psychological changes after birth. Nevertheless, 32,3% have manifested certain psychological changes, with baby blues being the most common ( 17,2%) followed by postpartum depression (7,5%) and anxiety disorder (6%). The age itself does not affect the change, while understanding and family support do. Quality education and awareness of the mother is very important , but it is important that the information is verified and accurate. The role of a health visitor, throught her education and advice, can prevent and identify certain difficulties in a timely manner is crucial and of great importance.",

      "abstract": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep DisordersCircadian rhythm sleep disorders all involve a problem in the timing of when a person sleeps and is awake.The human body has a master circadian clock in a control center of the brain known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).This internal clock regulates the timing of such body rhythms as temperature and hormone levels.The primary circadian rhythm that this body clock controls is the sleep-wake cycle.The circadian clock functions in a cycle that lasts a little longer than 24 hours.The circadian clock is \"set\" primarily by visual cues of light and darkness that are communicated along a pathway from the eyes to the SCN.This keeps the clock synchronized to the 24-hour day.Other time cues, know as zeitgebers, also can influence the clock's timing.These cues include meal and exercise schedules.Circadian rhythms and their sensitivity to time cues may change as a person ages.Each circadian rhythm sleep disorder involves one of these two problems:• You have a hard time initiating sleep.• You struggle to maintain sleep, waking up frequently during the night.• You tend to wake up too early and are unable to go back to sleep.• You sleep is nonrestorative or of poor quality. Types of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders• Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSP): DSP occurs when a person regularly goes to sleep and wakes up more than two hours later than is considered normal.People with DSP tend to be \"evening types\" who typically stay awake until 1 a.m. or later and wake-up in the late morning or afternoon.If able to go to bed at the preferred late time on a regular basis, a person with DSP will have a very stable sleep pattern.DPS is more common among adolescents and young adults with a reported prevalence of 7-16%.It is estimated that DPS is seen in approximately 10% of patients with chronic insomnia in sleep clinics.A positive family history may be present in approximately 40% of individuals with DPS.",

      "abstract": "This part examines the symptoms and diseases of neurotics with either a schizoid (38) or a hysterical (70) personality structure, comprising 5% and 10% respectively of the first admissions in 7 years. Compared to the hysterical structure, schizoids more frequently show the following characteristics: they are men and have as their secondary component a mixed character structure, an earlier age of onset, a longer duration of illness but earlier referral for psychotherapy. They suffer mainly from psychic symptoms--depressive states and contact difficulties as the indicating signs. Further complaints are defective concentration, feelings of apprehension and difficulty in working, also bulimia and the inability to breathe deeply. They were mostly born between 1940 and 1959. Their relatives suffered from psychiatric disorders. Compared to the schizoids, hysterically structured individuals are almost exclusively women, their second most important structural component being obsessive-compulsive. They develop their illness later, have it for a shorter time and are referred for psychotherapy later. Their indicating signs manifest themselves more often somatically, less frequently as anxiety states or phobias. The symptoms occur simultaneously in several organ systems, particularly the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract and the musculoskeletal system. Common symptoms are dyspnea and/or hyperventilation tetany, nausea, weight gain, frigidity and fluor as well as crying fits. They formerly suffered from gynecological disorders and had to undergo operations. They were mainly born between 1920 and 1939. Their relatives had cardiac disorders and their symptoms were identical or similar to those of their father.",

      "title": "Successful treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome using hydrogen gas: four case reports",
      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterized by unexplained fatigue and malaise that persist for more than 6 months with neuropsychiatric symptoms, including slight fever, headache, weakness, impaired thinking, and depression.[1,2] The onset and severity of these symptoms vary and reduce the quality of life as well as social, occupational, and personal activities of those affected, with some becoming bedridden.[1,2] The number of ME/CFS patients in the United States is estimated to be between 836,000 and 2.5 million.[3] Although it currently remains unclear whether there are objective and biological abnormalities in ME/CFS, recent neuroimaging, blood marker analyses, and energy metabolism and mitochondrial studies detected these abnormalities in ME/CFS patients.[4] ME/CFS may be caused by the activation of the immune system, both within and outside the brain, which induces the release of inflammatory cytokines. ME/CFS is presumed to cause abnormalities in the central and autonomic nervous systems, systemic energy metabolism, and immune system and also involve oxidative and nitrosative stress.[4,5,6] Dysfunctions in systemic energy metabolism may be related to abnormalities in the structure and function of mitochondria.[7,8,9,10] Molecular hydrogen (H2) is a gaseous molecule that selectively scavenges reactive oxygen and nitrogen species with strong oxidizing power, namely, hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and peroxynitrite, respectively.[11,12] H2 easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and biological membranes, reaches mitochondria, and protects cells from ·OH-induced cell damage.[11,12] A recent literature review revealed that H2 attenuated acute or chronic fatigue in animals and healthy subjects.[13] We also reported that the anti-fatigue effects of H2 involved the protection of mitochondria, which may also ameliorate the pathogenesis of ME/CFS.[13] Therefore, we conducted this case study to test this hypothesis by examining the efficacy of H2 gas inhalation in four patients with ME/CFS. Case 1: We herein present a 58-year-old male patient with ME/CFS who successfully responded to H2 gas inhalation therapy. The Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) are based on a score of 21 symptoms (no symptoms: 0, mild: 1, moderate: 2, severe: 3), including the typical symptoms of ME/CFS, such as post-exertional fatigue, sleep disturbance, impaired thinking, pain, autonomic disturbance, and chemical intolerance.[14] The score of each symptom and the total score of the 21 symptoms (a maximum score of 63) are used to establish whether symptoms improve or worsen.[14] To evaluate the efficacy of H2 gas inhalation for this patient, we adopted a medical interview and CCC recorded by the patient every two weeks because there is currently no accurate method to evaluate substances that show efficacy against ME/CFS other than patients' symptoms. The patient developed extreme fatigue, headache, and other symptoms in April 2012 and had difficulties thinking clearly and concentrating. He visited various hospitals in an attempt to diagnose and treat these symptoms, but was unsuccessful. He visited the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (NCNP) in 2019. Many examinations were performed and subjective symptoms met the ME/CFS criteria of CCC. Various treatments were conducted for approximately two years, but were unsuccessful. The patient inhaled 6–7% H2 gas (2 L/min, MHG-2000α, MiZ Company Limited, Kamakura, Japan) produced by water electrolysis between June 2021 and November 2021 for 3–5 hours per day. Severity scores before and after the H2 gas treatment are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1.Figure 1:: Changes in the total severity score and \"brain fog\" in a patient with ME/CFS after H2 gas inhalation.Note: The patient has been inhaling 6–7% H2 gas produced by water electrolysis for 3–5 hours per day. Each severity score before and after the H2 gas treatment was recorded based on CCC, and the total score (a score of 63) was calculated.[ 14 ] He was vaccinated against COVID-19 at weeks 8 and 11, and the vaccination exacerbated the symptoms of ME/CFS. However, symptoms recovered to the pre-vaccination level after 14 weeks of H2 gas inhalation. CCC: Canadian Consensus Criteria; COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019; H2: molecular hydrogen; ME/CFS: myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.Table 1:: Severity scores of 21 symptoms in a patient with ME/CFS after hydrogen (H2) gas inhalationThe severity score decreased from 29 points before treatment to 23 points after four weeks, confirming the significant attenuation of both chronic severe fatigue and intense fatigue after exertion. The amelioration of headaches, post-exertional muscle pain, joint pain, poor concentration, and a recurrent sore throat was also noted. Further improvements were observed after 6 weeks. Severe fatigue, headache, and muscle aches following an increased intensity of exercise were markedly alleviated. Weight gain was noted as well as increased blood flow to the feet, and shortness of breath on exertion and sensitivity to sound decreased. Although not reflected in the severity score, \"brain fog\" was reduced; the severity score after 6 weeks decreased to 15. The severity score was 16 after 8 weeks, which was not significantly different from that at 6 weeks; however, the number of days without \"brain fog\" had increased. The patient was vaccinated against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at weeks 8 and 11. Five days after the first vaccination, ME/CFS symptoms temporarily worsened, but recovered after week 10 of H2 gas inhalation with a severity score of 16. Eight days after the second vaccination (12 weeks after H2 gas inhalation), ME/CFS symptoms worsened more than after the first vaccination with a severity score of 27. However, following vigorous H2 gas inhalation, symptoms recovered to pre-vaccination levels after 14 weeks, and the severity score returned to 15. Although the COVID-19 vaccination exacerbated the symptoms of ME/CFS, this was temporary, and H2 gas inhalation markedly attenuated these symptoms. The severity score after 16 weeks was the same as that after 14 weeks, while daily activity levels significantly increased. Therefore, the patient was ready for rehabilitative training and a return to work. However, since his condition had not yet stabilized, the patient was only able to perform various activities to the same level as a healthy individual once every three days. Nevertheless, steady recovery was observed. Although fatigue after exertion still occurred, the patient was able to recover by resting for a few hours and inhaling H2 gas. After 18 weeks, the severity score was the same as those after 14 and 16 weeks; however, he was able to perform the activities of daily living, such as housework, light work, and going out in the neighborhood, and his physical symptoms, which recurred after the COVID-19 vaccination, had completely resolved. Since the patient also had a greater range of activities after 20 weeks of treatment, he took a small trip. He felt tired and easily fell asleep after returning home, but recovered within a few days, suggesting the fatigue-attenuating effects of H2 gas. Furthermore, the severity score decreased to 13 during this week. Cases 2–4: Due to the efficacy of H2 gas for ME/CFS in Case 1, three more case studies were conducted. We provided the same type of hydrogen gas inhaler used in Case 1 to three patients referred by NCNP. The efficacy of H2 gas was assessed twice, after 3 weeks and after 8 to 9 weeks, by an interview and the recording of general symptoms because patients were not able to perform self-scoring by CCC. Case 2: A 43-year-old woman diagnosed with probable ME/CFS by NCNP in 2017 attempted various treatments, but did not respond well. Prior to H2 gas inhalation, she was unable to maintain standing, erect, and seated postures due to significant reductions in upper and lower extremity and trunk functions. The patient spent most of her time in bed during the day and used a wheelchair for indoor mobility. She also exhibited general pain, weakness, malaise, fatigue after exertion, and sleep disturbance as well as slight fever, bradycardia, and hypotension, which were diagnosed by testing at NCNP. The patient inhaled H2 gas for 6 hours per day from the end of August 2021 to early November 2021. Sleep disturbance and daily headaches and migraines, which occurred several times a day, were attenuated after 3 weeks of inhalation. Nine weeks later, sleep disturbance, headaches, and migraines continued to be ameliorated by H2 gas inhalation. Case 3: An 18-year-old woman diagnosed with probable ME/CFS by NCNP in April 2020 had attempted various treatments, but did not respond well. She spent most of the day in bed. She began inhaling H2 gas for 5 hours per day from the end of August 2021 to the end of October 2021. Approximately 3 weeks after inhalation, she noted a decrease in fatigue, improved bowel movements, and increased motivation. At the end of 8 weeks, she was not sleeping as much during the day and had more time for physical activity, but still felt tired. Case 4: An 18-year-old man who was diagnosed with probable ME/CFS and fibromyalgia by NCNP in August 2020 attempted various treatments, but did not respond well. Prior to H2 gas inhalation, the patient exhibited fatigue, headache, muscle weakness, general aches and pains, sleep disturbance, impaired thinking, concentration, and memory, tinnitus, and \"brain fog\". He began inhaling H2 gas for 6 hours per day from the end of August 2021 to early November 2021. The attenuation of headache and general pain was noted after approximately 3 weeks of treatment, and the ameliorating effects of H2 gas inhalation on these symptoms continued after 9 weeks, with a decrease in the use of analgesics. In addition, \"brain fog\" improved. Substances that attenuate the pathogenesis of ME/CFS are being developed. Clinical studies investigated the efficacies of the antibody drug rituximab, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen, coenzyme Q10, and acetyl L-carnitine for the treatment of ME/CFS, but found that they were ineffective or their effects were limited.[15,16,17,18] Therefore, the development of therapeutic substances that are curative rather than symptomatic for ME/CFS is needed. In this case study, we examined the efficacy of H2 gas in four patients with ME/CFS. Case 1, a patient diagnosed with ME/CFS 2 years ago who did not respond to various therapies, was treated with H2 gas inhalation for 20 weeks. H2 gas inhalation significantly attenuated post-exertional fatigue, the recovery time from exertion, shortness of breath on exertion, headache, sore throat, poor concentration, abnormal body temperature, and sensitivity to sound. Cases 2–4 were also patients who did not respond to various treatment attempts. After 8 to 9 weeks of H2 gas inhalation, headache, general aches and pains, sleep disturbances, bowel movements, decreased motivation, and brain fog improved in all three patients. These four cases are the first in which H2 gas inhalation has been shown to attenuate the symptoms of ME/CFS. COVID-19 results from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although acute symptoms resolve within 2–3 weeks, some patients continue to have \"sequelae\" for months after the initial infection. A number of symptoms have been reported as these \"sequelae,\" which are termed \"long COVID\" or \"post COVID\" and are similar to those of ME/CFS.[19,20] However, despite these similarities, it remains unclear whether COVID-19 infection is a trigger for the development of ME/CFS.[19,20] Botek et al.[21] recently conducted a single-blind randomized trial on 50 \"post COVID\" patients and reported that 14 days of H2 gas inhalation improved physical and respiratory functions in the acute phase of infection. Although further large-scale studies are needed, if we assume that \"long COVID\" or \"post COVID\" develops via the same mechanism as ME/CFS, the results of our case study are supported by the findings of Botek et al.[21] In conclusion, since this was a case study based on self-assessments by a small number of patients and not a clinical study in the form of a randomized controlled trial, there are some limitations to the present results. Nevertheless, the results obtained suggest the potential of H2 gas as a therapeutic gas for ME/CFS. Further large-scale clinical studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of H2 gas as a therapeutic agent for ME/CFS and the underlying mechanism of action.

      "title": "Hot off the press: <scp>MRI</scp> sensitivity for transient global amnesia",
      "abstract": "Transient global amnesia (TGA) is an idiopathic acute neurological disorder that presents with sudden onset anterograde memory loss. It was first described as a syndrome in 1956 by Courjon and Guyotat1 and also by Bender.2 Fisher and Adams formally described TGA in 1964.3 The usual presentation is a patient between 50 and 70 years of age who is cognitively and neurologically intact but asking repetitive questions and unable to form new memories. Symptoms are short-lived and resolve within 24 h. The incidence has been reported as 23.5 per 100,000 people per year and is more common in people who get migraine headaches.4, 5 TGA is often precipitated by physical or emotional stressors, pain, the Valsalva maneuver, hot or cold water immersion, or sexual intercourse.6 The criterion standard of TGA diagnosis combines seven clinical criteria: the attack is witnessed, there is clear anterograde amnesia, the absence of other neurological symptoms during the attack, the absence of abnormal neurological examination findings, memory loss is less than 24 h, there are no epileptic features or history of same, and there is no recent head injury.7 The workup of TGA can include laboratory testing, EEG, ECG, echocardiography, and advanced neuroimaging. This is a systematic review of observational studies of TGA. It included adult patients with a diagnosis of TGA based on existing clinical criteria who were evaluated with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) at varying time intervals (e.g., 0–12 h, 12–24 h) after symptom onset. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of DW-MRI in diagnosis of TGA. DW-MRI had low sensitivity for TGA early after symptom onset, but the sensitivity increased over time. The authors concluded that obtaining a DW-MRI in patients with a clinical diagnosis of TGA in the acute setting is likely a low-yield test. This was a good quality systematic review with a relevant diagnostic question, a detailed search strategy, and appropriate assessment of primary studies for common forms of bias. The major limitations of the included studies were the lack of precision (i.e., wide confidence intervals [CIs]) and high heterogeneity for estimates of DW-MRI sensitivity in diagnosing TGA. Heterogeneity as measured by the I2 test was very high at 72%–96% for most measured time points after symptom onset. Another limitation is that all studies included in this systematic review were observational in nature, with no randomized trials allocating patients to any time frame. Furthermore, although there were almost 1700 patients included in this review, there were still very few patients in some of the time points at which MRI was performed. This study also suffered from partial verification bias, also known as referral or workup bias. This occurs when only a certain set of patients who underwent the index test are verified by the reference standard. In this case, only those who met the clinical criteria for TGA had a DW-MRI performed, while patients who did not meet clinical criteria did not have an MRI. This could increase the overall sensitivity reported in the study. Finally, to get an accurate measure of sensitivity and specificity, we need a criterion standard to measure against. TGA is a clinical diagnosis, and the criterion standards used were the defined clinical criteria for the disease. This may be a somewhat uncertain criterion standard. Furthermore, if the criterion standard is clinical, the bedside physician already has access to the criterion standard diagnosis, and it is reasonable to ask what value an MRI could possibly add. Overall, 23 studies with a total of 1688 patients met inclusion criteria. All studies were case series of adult patients who were diagnosed with TGA clinically and who underwent DW-MRI. In the first 12 h from symptom onset, sensitivity of DW-MRI is 15.6%. Sensitivity improves thereafter to ranges as high as 83%, but there are very wide CIs for all point estimates and significant heterogeneity between studies. The Table 1 summarizes sensitivity of DW-MRI as a function of time interval from symptom onset. This study emphasizes the value of clinical criteria in the diagnosis of TGA and the low yield of DW-MRI testing. This is valuable information as it will reduce the unnecessary use of an expensive and time-consuming test in the acute setting. It is possible but unlikely that future prospective and randomized trials will change this. @shawnkdowling: Assuming there are no red flags, I do some basic labs and non-contrast CT head. I'd never considered ordering a DW-MRI and glad I do not need to based on this study. I typically consult neuro if the amnesia has not resolved at 12 h. @iwwalker: Textbook TGA does not need a neuro consult so consulting early likely keeps them unnecessarily in the ED for that, but cannot send them home until resolved regardless. If TGA is going on and on, I would also question the diagnosis, thus the referral. @Kapur_AK: Similar approach here. Our neurologists suggest we refer all as outpatients, which I'm okay with doing. I refer atypical or prolonged presentations in the ED (closer to 4–6 h). Ultimately the conclusion of emergency physicians weighing in on Twitter was not to order MRIs, while outpatient neurology consultation practices were variable. Clinical criteria remain the criterion standard in diagnosis of transient global amnesia. Early imaging with DW-MRI is a low-yield test and should not be performed in the emergency department. The authors declare no potential conflict of interest.",

      "abstract": "The associations between depressive symptoms and hypersomnia are complex and often bidirectional. Of the many disorders associated with excessive sleepiness in the general population, the most frequent are mental health disorders, particularly depression. However, most mood disorder studies addressing hypersomnia have assessed daytime sleepiness using a single response, neglecting critical and clinically relevant information about symptom severity, duration and nighttime sleep quality. Only a few studies have used objective tools such as polysomnography to directly measure both daytime and nighttime sleep propensity in depression with normal mean sleep latency and sleep duration. Hypersomnia in mood disorders, rather than a medical condition per se, is more a subjective sleep complaint than an objective finding. Mood symptoms have also been frequently reported in hypersomnia disorders of central origin, especially in narcolepsy. Hypocretin deficiency could be a contributing factor in this condition. Further interventional studies are needed to explore whether management of sleep complaints improves mood symptoms in hypersomnia disorders and, conversely, whether management of mood complaints improves sleep symptoms in mood disorders.",

The neurotransmitter mechanism in the reticular substance that is the cause of migraine may be triggered by changes in barometric pressure, substances contained in certain foods such as a gringo menu of frijoles seasoned with monosodium glutamate and sharp cheese, wine, exposure to glare off an airplane wing, positive or negative emotion on returning to one's family, hormonal changes of the approach of the new menstrual month, or other factors unique to the individual.

Significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, i.e., an IQ of 70 or below on an individually administered IQ test. 2. Concurrent deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning, i.e., an individual's effectiveness in meeting standard expectations in a range of areas, such as social skills and responsibility, communication, daily coping, personal independence, and self-sufficiency. 3.

Most cases are reported in males, Koro syndrome in females is very rare. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old woman presented with complaints that the skin over the vagina is retracting inside her body and feeling that something will happen to her if it gets fully retracted for 9 months. She had multiple consultations with the gynecologist who found no anatomical abnormality on examination and referred the patient to a psychiatrist, where she was diagnosed with Koro syndrome and was started on psychotropic medication. Conclusion: Female with Koro syndrome is expressed mainly in an epidemic setting due to cultural and psycho-social factors such as cultural taboos that suppress the expression of atypical sexual symptoms, inadequate knowledge, and misconceptions.",

Gejala non motorik PP diantaranya adalah gangguan neuropsikiatri seperti depresi, psikosis, ansietas. Kami melaporkan sebuah kasus PP dengan gejala psikotik berupa halusinasi yang jarang dijumpai. Laporan Kasus: Pasien perempuan berusia 74 tahun terdiagnosis Parkinson sejak lebih dari 20 tahun, dibawa ke rumah sakit dengan bicara tidak nyambung, adanya halusinasi visual, dan emosi yang tidak stabil sejak 1 bulan. Keluarga pasien juga merasa sejak 6 bulan terakhir pasien menjadi sering lupa. Pasien dengan riwayat PP tidak rutin mengkonsumsi obat parkinson di bawah supervisi dokter. Keluhan halusinasi pernah dirasakan 2 tahun lalu namun membaik setelah perawatan. Diskusi: Gejala non motorik dapat dijumpai seiring perkembangan penyakit Parkinson dandapat diidentifikasi sebelum sindrom motor muncul. Adanya gejala psikosis berupa halusinasi dalam kasus yang dipaparkan terhadi setelah 18 tahun sejak pasien terdiagnosis, dimana berdasarkan hasil studi terdahulu dilaporkan 60% penderita PP berkembang adanya halusinasi atau delusi setelah 12 tahun perawatan dan pada usia lebih tua saat onset PP. Gangguan kognitif pada PP juga dicurigai dalam kasus walau belum sepenuhnya dapat ditegakan serta adanya gangguan tidur pada PP dengan prevalensi 40-90% dijumpai pada kasus yang kami laporkan. Kesimpulan: Manifestasi non motorik PP yang mencakup gejala neuropsikiatri sangat mempengaruhi kualitas hidup pasien maupun keluarga dan perawat pasien. Klinisi harus meningkatkan kewaspadaan terhadap gejala non motorik PP dan pemberian tatalaksana farmakologi dan non farmakologi harus dilakukan secara terintegratif bersama dengan bidang-bidang terkait sesuai dengan kondisi pasien.

      "title": "Depression in Older Adults",
      "abstract": "Depression is less prevalent among older adults than among younger adults, but it can have serious consequences. More than half of cases represent a first onset in later life. Although suicide rates in the elderly are declining, they are still higher than in younger adults and are more closely associated with depression. Depressed older adults are less likely to endorse affective symptoms and more likely to display cognitive changes, somatic symptoms, and loss of interest than are depressed younger adults. Risk factors leading to the development of late-life depression likely comprise complex interactions among genetic vulnerabilities, cognitive diathesis, age-associated neurobiological changes, and stressful events. Insomnia is an often overlooked risk factor for late-life depression. We suggest that a common pathway to depression in older adults, regardless of which predisposing risks are most prominent, may be curtailment of daily activities. Accompanying self-critical thinking may exacerbate and maintain a depressed state. Offsetting the increasing prevalence of certain risk factors in late life are age-related increases in psychological resilience. Other protective factors include higher education and socioeconomic status, engagement in valued activities, and religious or spiritual involvement. Treatments including behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, cognitive bibliotherapy, problem-solving therapy, brief psychodynamic therapy, and life review/reminiscence therapy are effective but are too infrequently used with older adults. Preventive interventions including education for individuals with chronic illness, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, problem-solving skills training, group support, and life review have also received support.",

The feeling of an acceleration or a slowing down of the passage of time (PoT) is common. However, there are very few experiments on this temporal feeling. In addition, the few data on the subject are contradictory because of the variety of meanings that this judgement can encompass. The aim of this chapter is to define the different forms of judgement of the PoT according to the period considered and the underlying psychological mechanisms. Four types of PoT judgement are then distinguished: the retrospective PoT judgements for the long periods of life (5–10 years, as we get older) and those for the shorter periods (last week, last month), and the PoT judgements for the present, made either retrospectively (present PoT judgement) or prospectively (PoT judgement of durations).",

Thorough and interdisciplinary diagnostics including extensive allergological testing procedures (provocative tests) revealed both somatic diagnoses (contact allergy, pseudo-allergic reactions, sicca syndrome, liver steatosis, porokeratosis superficialis disseminata actinica) as well as psychiatric diagnoses (predisposition to depression). Some symptoms improved in the course of the disease.

Burnout syndrome develops as the sequence of emotional exhaustion, followed by depersonalization as a coping mechanism, and which finally manifests itself as feelings of professional dissatisfaction and anguish. If burnout continues into residency and later into medical practice, it will affect the physician’s functioning and quality of life. Interventions targeting unsuccessful coping strategies and complications related to burnout, may offer an opportunity to improve medical student well-being and mental health.",

Two remain the most basic approaches to anxiety management and treatment of anxiety disorder, and these are: medication and psychotherapy. Anxiety disorder does not go away on its own. The fact that there are occasional periods of remission in symptoms does not mean that the problem is over. This paper presents the aforementioned two methods of treating anxiety disorders.",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico.

Psychiatric and psychological difficulties tend to be under-recognised and undertreated yet cause great disability, significantly impact the quality of life of patients and add to greater burden on their caregivers. These symptoms can be relieved through adjusting the doses of anti-Parkinson’s drug therapy and success in improving psychological distress has been found using adjuvant psychotherapeutic intervention, most notably with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.",

There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

      "abstract": "Die motorisierte Verkehrsteilnahme gewinnt fuer aeltere Menschen zunehmend an Bedeutung. Im Alter von ueber 70 Jahren setzt jedoch eine Steigerung der Unfallbeteiligung unter Beruecksichtigung der Kilometerleistung ein. Sie ist vermutlich den in diesem Alter zunehmenden neurodegenerativen und kardiovaskulaeren Erkrankungen zuzuschreiben. Die Abnahme der visuellen und kognitiven Faehigkeiten im Rahmen des normalen Alterungsprozesses hat dagegen nur einen geringen Einfluss auf die Fahreignung: Auch ein Fahrer, der aelter ist als 85 Jahre, kann faehrfaehig sein, eine Selbstverstaendlichkeit ist dies jedoch nicht. Funktionell gesehen geht der Alterungsprozess vor allem mit einer Verzoegerung der Wahrnehmungs-, Entscheidungs- und Bewegungsprozesse und dem Nachlassen der Faehigkeit einher, mehrere Aufgaben zu gleicher Zeit zu erledigen. Die Schwierigkeiten des Autofahrens kann man durch die Wahl der Strecke, Fahrtzeit und Geschwindigkeit groesstenteils selbst bestimmen. Wenn schwerwiegende Funktionsstoerungen auftreten, kann selbststaendiges Autofahren zum Problem werden, auch wenn haeufig bereits spontane Anpassungen in den Fahrgewohnheiten vorangegangen sind. Vor allem aeltere Menschen, bei denen die Ausfuehrung alltaeglicher praktischer Fertigkeiten wie das Ankleiden und das Ausfuellen von Formularen langsam und ungeschickt ablaeuft, haben haeufig auch Probleme mit der praktischen Fahreignung. Sehr nuetzlich fuer aeltere Fahrer sind infrastrukturelle Massnahmen zur Reduzierung der Geschwindigkeit des kreuzenden Verkehrs (zum Beispiel Mini-Kreisverkehr) und die Verdeutlichung der Verkehrssituationen (zum Beispiel durch optimales Aufstellen von Verkehrszeichen und Hinweisschildern). Fuer aeltere Autofahrer mit schwerwiegenden Funktionsstoerungen werden haeufig sehr spezielle Massnahmen zur Unterstuetzung der verkehrsspezifischen Verhaltensanpassung erforderlich sein.

      "abstract": "Dietary supplements, including vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and enzymes, have become increasingly more common and are used by approximately half of the US population. About three-fourths of supplements are obtained with no prescription from a physician, which raises medical concerns regarding safety as these products do not require US Food and Drug Administration approval. Common reasons for taking dietary supplements include improved mood, improved mental function, depression relief, anxiety reduction, and treatment of simple and migraine headaches. The use of herbs for medicinal purposes has a long-standing history among many cultures. We present the case of a 43-year-old man, who was taking dietary supplements, with a 6-month history of psychotic symptoms that increasingly caused impairment in functioning and eventually led to involuntary hospitalization. The published data with regard to supplements causing psychosis, herb-to-herb interaction, and reliability of herbal supplement manufacturers are discussed.",

      "title": "Prevalence and clinical specificity of fatigue symptoms in chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis",
      "abstract": "This article provides a critical review of the psychological and related literature on fatigue resulting in both mental and physical experiences. On one hand, prolonged severe fatigue is a prominent disabling symptom in various diseases of different aetiology – psychiatric (e.g. depression), somatic (e.g. some infections) and neurologic (e.g. multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis). For instance, fatigue is a main symptom of myasthenia that leads to pathological skeletal muscle weakness. Furthermore, 40 to 90 per cent of individuals suffering from multiple sclerosis confirm they have experienced fatigue, which impairs their cognitive functioning. In both multiple sclerosis and myasthenia, fatigue has not only a physical but also a psychological dimension. On the other hand, fatigue can be seen as an isolated set of symptoms of unknown origin called the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The development of the concept, diagnostic criteria and some strategies of coping with CFS are presented. Various somatic disorders, as well as subjective cognitive and emotional complaints, are common and well documented in patients with CFS. The most typical include depression, as well as problems with concentration of attention, decision-making and reasoning in complex situations. However, general intellectual abilities and higher order cognitive skills are intact. Directions for future research are outlined.",

      "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is among the most common mental health conditions. Up to 20% of people are af-fected by anxiety problems each year. An ongoing feeling of overwhelm, fear, and concern are signs of general-ised anxiety disorder. Generalised anxiety disorder is characterised by excessive, irrational, and persistent worry about everyday issues. This worry may have several aspects, including financial, family, health, and future con-cerns. Most people with GAD also have additional mental diseases, such as panic disorder, social anxiety disor-der, significant depression, or particular phobia. Generalised anxiety disorder can affect both adults and children. The sickness often begins in infancy or adolescence but can begin at any age. GAD is twice as common in women and those assigned female at birth as it is in men and those assigned male at birth. Charaka stated the Manasavikara (mental disorder) Chittodvega (anxiety), which is said to be the ideal word to highlight the state of anxiety, namely generalised anxiety disorder. Both as a distinct illness and as a contributing component to other psychological and psychosomatic disorders, Chittodvega can occur. According to clinical investigations, anxiolytic medications by themselves have limited long-term effectiveness, and serious side effects such as se-dation, drug dependency, and resistance cannot be avoided. Ayurveda takes a psychosocial approach to medi-cine. Acharya Charaka describes three forms of treatment for mental and physical illnesses: Satwavajaya Chikitsa (Psychotherapy), Yuktivyapashraya (Rational therapy), and Daivavyapashraya (Spiritual therapy). Apart from these, we can also treat mental illness through counselling. Thus, the current study examines Chittodvega from the Ayurvedic classics and how to handle it.",

Somatic symptom disorder incorporates the older diagnoses of somatoform disorder, somatization disorder, Briquet’s syndrome, and hypochondriasis. Somatic symptom disorder of mild severity is common in medical clinics; it usually responds to simple explanation and reassurance. More severe somatic symptom disorder with multiple symptoms and severe disability is less common, but important to diagnose because these patients are at substantial risk of iatrogenic harm from excessive investigation and speculative medical or surgical treatment. Severe somatic symptom disorder usually requires multidisciplinary care, including liaison psychiatry.",

Llegando a negativa para ingerir alimentos y permanencia en posición fija de sedestación, como elementos clave para la sospecha clínica y el diagnóstico oportuno. Descripción del caso: Masculino de 57 años, con historia de síntomas afectivos, quien ingreso a urgencias diagnosticado con episodio depresivo mayor de características catatónicas, el cual mejoró con el inicio de midazolam y luego titulación de Lorazepam. Pasadas cinco semanas de estancia hospitalaria fue dado de alta con antidepresivos y dosis estándar de benzodiazepinas, las cuales se retiraron ambulatoriamente, sin recurrencia de los síntomas durante un año de seguimiento. Conclusiones: Un episodio catatónico puede ser causado por trastornos afectivos. La catatonía secundaria a trastornos afectivos es rara en la práctica clínica, lo cual causa que pase inadvertida, por lo cual el conocimiento de esta alteración genera un manejo oportuno de pacientes reduciendo el gasto de los recursos del sistema de salud y mejorando la calidad de vida de la persona.

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Overall, 90.9% of Latin American women will have at least one climacteric symptom and in 25%, these will be severe. Musculoskeletal pain, physical and mental fatigue and depressed mood are the most common climacteric symptoms. Dyspareunia, mood disorders and irritability can significantly alter female sexuality. Hot flashes are the symptoms most frequently related to menopause by both physicians and patients. However, it is one of the less common menopausal symptoms. This symptom reflects the neurochemical brain disorders caused by estrogen deficiency. The central nervous system (CNS) is also involved in changes of body composition leading to higher adipose tissue accumulation during climacterium, deteriorating quality of life and increasing the risk for chronic non-transmittable diseases. Menopausal discomfort also overloads health systems increasing the demand for medical services and decreasing productivity by labor absenteeism. Hormone therapy of menopause (HTM) decreases menopausal symptoms and improves quality of life. If we do not prescribe HTM to those women who need it, we could deprive them from several potential health benefits.",

Postpartum depression is a relatively frequent psychiatric pathology involving some challenges in managing and treating the case due to the increased risk of suicide and infanticide. Having a relatively early postpartum onset within 4-12 weeks, this pathology may have psychological, social and family repercussions in the long term, both on the mother and father, but especially on the child. Postpartum depression manifests with symptoms typical of all depressive episodes, such as depressed mood, irritability, low tolerance to frustration, anxiety, hypersomnia, but also more specific symptoms such as feelings and guilty thoughts about correct child development, lack of empathy, lack of maternal behavior. Emotional, socio-cultural and physiological factors play an important role in the onset of this symptomatology. Postpartum depression raises ethical concerns about the proper conduct of the doctor. In this article we will address both deontological aspects such as doctor-patient confidentiality, suicide and infanticide, as well as the legal aspects that may occur in such situations. Thus, postpartum depression is a therapeutic challenge because of the multiple social, family and legal interferences it presents.",

      "title": "Do antidepressants improve negative symptoms in schizophrenia?",
      "abstract": "The negative symptoms of schizophrenia comprise a range of deficits in communication, emotional responsiveness, socialisation, capacity for experiencing pleasure, and motivation. Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

The types and frequency of sleep disturbance tend to vary with age and, although some remit spontaneously, a substantial proportion of them persist. Particularly high rates of sleep disturbance occur in children who have learning disabilities, are physically ill, or psychologically disturbed. The immediate effects of sleep problems are important but so, also, are the longer-term effects which may influence the child's physical, psychological, and social development. Persistent sleep disturbance is associated with behavioural disturbance in children and may affect performance in school. Raised levels of maternal stress and impairment of parenting skills have also been reported as a consequence.",

      "abstract": "Mild head injury is a quiet disorder. It is common, typically bloodless and without call for significant medical intervention. It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is considered one of the leading psychiatric disorders due to its\r\n incidence of 1% in the general population. Due to its many presentations it can not be defined as\r\n a single entity, but rather a disorder with heterogeneous genetic, neurobiological, environmental\r\n and social background, manifested by a series of cognitive, behavioral and emotional deviations,\r\n which speaks in favor that there are no two identical clinical presentations of schizophrenia.\r\n Schizophrenia is also a chronic disorder, requiring long-term care. Because of its long duration,\r\n insufficiently known etiology, behavioral changes and alterations of psychic functions, and the\r\n fact that it most commonly occurs during late adolescence, schizophrenia significantly impairs\r\n work and social functionality of the affected individual and has a negative impact on both the\r\n quality of life of the patient and the patient’s family, health system and society in general.\r\n What has recently caught the field’s attention is the presence of comorbid somatic\r\n diseases in patients with schizophrenia who have not yet been adequately diagnosed and treated.\r\n One of the most common and severely debilitating is the metabolic syndrome. It is a syndrome\r\n consisting of a series of metabolic abnormalities that result from a number of factors, such as:\r\n inadequate nutrition, lack of physical activity and smoking, the effects of the psychotic disorder\r\n itself, as well as the potentially adverse effects of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia.\r\n The term metabolic syndrome implies abdominal or central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia with\r\n lowered HDL-cholesterol, hypertension and hyperglycemia. If these metabolic disorders occur at\r\n the same time, the patient is at increased risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease and the\r\n development of type II diabetes. Cardiovascular disease, along with suicide, is the most important\r\n cause of mortality in patients with schizophrenia. Metabolic abnormalities are known to be\r\n associated with chronic course of the disorder and long-term administration of certain\r\n antipsychotics. However, there is a possibility that metabolic parameters are impaired at the\r\n outset of the disorder, that is, when the first diagnosis of schizophrenia is made. That is in fact the\r\n main hypothesis of this research. The aim of the study was to prospectively examine and analyze the values of the\r\n aforementioned metabolic parameters and to determine if the metabolic syndrome is present in\r\n 30 subjects with the first episode of schizophrenia. Those values were compared with those of\r\n other 30 subjects, who were previously diagnosed with schizophrenia and another 30 subjects,\r\n who were not diagnosed with the disorder (healthy individuals). This study was conducted at the\r\n Clinic for Psychiatry of the UHC Sestre milosrdnice. For the purpose of the study, laboratory\r\n values of serum lipids and glucose, anthropometric measures, and the existence of nicotine\r\n dependence in the subjects were analyzed.\r\n The study did not confirm the hypothesis that metabolic parameters are abnormal at\r\n the very beginning of the disorder, when the diagnosis of schizophrenia is made for the first time\r\n in patients’ lives. The present parameters do not meet the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of\r\n metabolic disorder in patients with the first episode of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The disease affects more women than men and often is diagnosed during a woman's childbearing years. Typical clinical presentations of the disease are extensive and variable, with symptoms that include dysregulated mood, fatigue, vision problems, weakness, tremor, imbalance, abnormal sensations, bladder dysfunction, and heat sensitivity. If a woman aged 15-50 years experiences these neurologic symptoms in isolation or combination, and the symptoms are not explained by other underlying medical conditions, MS should be suspected. Multiple sclerosis can be divided into four clinical subtypes: 1) relapsing-remitting MS, 2) secondary progressive MS, 3) primary progressive MS, and 4) clinically isolated syndrome. Relapsing-remitting MS at the time of onset is the most common form and accounts for approximately 80% of all cases of MS. Relapsing-remitting MS does not affect life expectancy. However, because of the neurodegenerative and progressive course of the disease, patients accumulate physical and cognitive disabilities over time that result in impaired ability to work, increased financial burden, and slightly increased mortality. A variety of possible risk and prognostic indicators have been identified that may predict the course of disease, particularly the extent of relapses and disability. Multiple sclerosis currently is incurable, but many disease-modifying therapies are available that can reduce the frequency of clinically evident exacerbations and accumulation of disease burden as defined by the number of lesions identified on magnetic resonance imaging. The choice of disease-modifying therapies, contraception use, and treatment of symptoms should be individualized based on age at onset and disease activity and, during pregnancy, the gestational age. Proactive management of MS across the woman's life cycle reduces morbidity, improves maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and increases quality-of life-measures for patients and their families.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic inconsistent widespread pain and tenderness. It is also associated with other comorbid symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairments (memory and mood disturbances), and/or irritable bowel syndrome. <sup>[1]</sup> Prevalence of fibromyalgia is 2.7% globally, being slightly higher in middle aged women (4-9%). 75 to 100 % patients with fibromyalgia face depression, anxiety and/or stress. The probability of occurrence of depression is almost 40% at any stage in the course of fibromyalgia. <sup>[2]</sup> Patients usually report physical symptoms of depression (e.g. appetite, sleep, and sexual dysfunction) rather than mood-related psychological symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation, low self-esteem), however depression is affective expression of chronic pain and neuromarkers of both cannot be isolate. <sup>[3]</sup> Reviews done till date are either oriented toward specific form of exercise or towards specific outcome. We could not come across any review which included all form of exercise with measurement of multiple outcomes. <h3>Objectives</h3> The aim of this review was to 1) summarize evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 2) determine the most effective rehabilitation strategy for reducing pain and depression in people with FMS. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed, Ovid (Sp), and Cochrane search engines were used for identifying the studies done till 1 July 2022. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that have passive control group and active control group were included in this review for primary and secondary aim respectively. The primary outcome measures were Pain and depression. Secondary outcome was one from the sleep or fatigue or healthy related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 25 RCTs were included. Separate random effect model meta-analysis is performed for randomised control trial with active and passive control group. Mean difference or Standard Mean difference with 95% confidence interval used to assess the effect size. Studies with passive control group showed moderate to large positive effects on pain (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.38; I2 = 72%) and HRQOL(MD -5.40, 95% CI -10.17 to -0.62; I2 = 74%) but non-significant for sleep, fatigue, and depression. Furthermore, on subgroup analysis studies with short term protocol showed significant effect on pain only, whereas studies with long term protocols showed positive effect on pain and HRQOL only but non-significant at the time of post-trial follow-up. Studies with active control group represent non- significant results except mixed exercises which showed positive effect (MD -4.78, 95% CI -7.98 to -1.57; I2 = 0%) for HRQOL. <h3>Conclusion</h3> All rehabilitation strategies were effective for pain and HRQOL, and has marginal effect on depression, sleep, and fatigue but efficacy was not maintained at the time of post-trial follow-up. However, in this review we could not differentiate any rehabilitation strategies for the best among those used in the included studies. <h3>References</h3> [1]Queiroz LP.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness that affects 1 percent of the population in all cultures. It affects equal numbers of men and women, but the onset is often later in women than in men. Schizophrenia is characterized by positive and negative symptoms. Positive symptoms include hallucinations, voices that converse with or about the patient, and delusions that are often paranoid. Negative symptoms include flattened affect, loss of a sense of pleasure, loss of will or drive, and social withdrawal. Both types of symptoms affect patients' families; therefore, it is important for physicians to provide guidance to all persons affected by the disease. Psychosocial and family interventions can improve outcomes. Medications can control symptoms, but virtually all antipsychotics have neurologic or physical side effects (e.g., weight gain, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes). There is a 10 percent lifetime risk of suicide in patients with schizophrenia.",

These features may be present as associated symptoms during a depressive episode or as specific comorbidities (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder). Other symptoms, including fatigue or low energy and cognitive dysfunction (problems with concentration, memory, decision-making), warrant special attention because they are major mediators of functional impairment and are common residual symptoms during treatment. The presence of these associated clinical features can affect the differential diagnosis and management of depression, e.g. in the selection and use of an antidepressant and/or a psychological treatment.",

The first involves a gradual reduction in the output of thyroid hormone over a period of months, or years due, for example, to Hashimoto's disease. Clinically recognizable myxoedema may eventually appear, and in some cases—one-third of Jellinek's (1962) series—it is associated with mental disorders of almost any type and degree (Akelaitis, 1936; Asher, 1949). Two reports (Logothetis, 1963; Pomeranze and King, 1966) make it clear that major mental illness, often clinically indistinguishable from what might be called the normal run of schizophrenias, affective disorders and dementias, can be caused by hypothyroidism even before any clinical evidence of thyroid disorder appears.",

      "abstract": "An inherited, congenital disorder resembling stiff-man syndrome is described in ten individuals from three generations of a family. The disease is apparently inherited as a dominant trait; x-linkage cannot be excluded. The diagnosis was based on the following criteria; (1) attacks of stiffness precipitated by surprise or minor physical contact; difficulty in sudden movements but absence of signs of myotonia or myokymia; (2) presence of the electromyographic counterpart of the stiffness, continuous activity at rest with normal action potentials; (3) disappearance of the continuous electrical activity after diazepam. The symptoms were most marked in infancy, but ameliorated with time, becoming milder than in the average acquired case. The cause of this familial syndrome is presumably different from that or those of acquired, sporadic cases of stiff-man syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) are often caused by a blow to the head or a sudden jolt resulting in a wide range of physical, cognitive, and emotional temporary symptoms. Mild TBI diagnosis can be challenging and most commonly followed by post-concussion syndrome (PCS). When the symptoms are present for more than 3 months, prolonged post-concussive syndrome (PPCS) can be suspected. This review aims to identify and summarize the current status of the knowledge regarding the risk factors and predictors of the recovery from PCS and PPCS. A comprehensive search of the main scientific databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library) was performed using keywords, such as: 'prolonged post-concussion syndrome', combined with 'risk factors', 'predictors', and 'outcomes'. Multiple studies reported more than one risk factor for PPCS development following mTBIs that were generally the results of sports-related concussions and car accidents. The most prevalent risk factor associated with PPCS was the female sex. Social factors/personality traits, anxiety, mental health disorders, or other health conditions from their past medical history, the occurrence of headache/migraines during TBI recovery, somatization, physical activity, and litigation were also reported to contribute to PPCS risk. An exhaustive approach is required to mitigate the risk of PPCS and to ensure optimal recovery after concussive events. However, larger prospective cohort studies evaluating patients that were examined and treated with standardized protocols could be needed to further validate these associations and mandate the highest risk factors for delayed recovery.",

      "abstract": "The papers in this special section are the proceedings of a symposium on chronobiology and mood disorders presented at the June 1999 meeting of the Canadian College of Neuropsychopharmacology in Halifax, Nova Scotia. These papers review aspects of mood disorders that are linked to biological rhythms with 3 different periodicities: daily, menstrual and annual. They also reflect a growing interest in mechanisms regulating physiological rhythmicity on a variety of time scales and in the impact of normal and pathologic function of these mechanisms on psychiatric illnesses. Rhythms are related to mood disorders in several different ways. First, some conditions are expressed cyclically; that is, they have a period linked to an identified internal or external periodicity, such as menstrual and annual rhythms of dysphoria or depression. Other conditions, such as many cases of bipolar illness, express cycles that are not tied to any identified periodic stimulus. A second connection between rhythms and mood disorders is the alteration of daily rhythms, in particular sleep and waking, in mood disorders. Finally, the systems responsible for the generation or synchronization of normal rhythms may be involved in the etiology of mood disorders, as has sometimes been proposed, for example, for bipolar illness and for seasonal affective disorders. Connections between psychiatric disorders and biological rhythms were reviewed more than 40 years ago in a landmark monograph by Curt Paul Richter, whose innovative concepts and studies gave birth to many fields of psychobiological research, as well as establishing key concepts and analytic methods for the study of biological rhythms. Richter’s 1965 monograph Biological Clocks in Medicine and Psychiatry presented material from two 1959 Salmon Lectures to the New York Academy of Medicine. It serves as a benchmark for assessing the developments in this area of research over the last few decades.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review. In this review, we provide an update of recent studies on the age of onset (AOO) of the major mental disorders, with a special focus on the availability and use of services providing prevention and early intervention. Recent findings. The studies reviewed here confirm previous reports on the AOO of the major mental disorders. Although the behaviour disorders and specific anxiety disorders emerge during childhood, most of the high-prevalence disorders (mood, anxiety and substance use) emerge during adolescence and early adulthood, as do the psychotic disorders. Early AOO has been shown to be associated with a longer duration of untreated illness, and poorer clinical and functional outcomes. Summary. Although the onset of most mental disorders usually occurs during the first three decades of life, effective treatment is typically not initiated until a number of years later. There is increasing evidence that intervention during the early stages of disorder may help reduce the severity and/or the persistence of the initial or primary disorder, and prevent secondary disorders. However, additional research is needed on effective interventions in early-stage cases, as well as on the long-term effects of early intervention, and for an appropriate service design for those with emerging mental disorders. This will mean not only the strengthening and re-engineering of existing systems, but is also crucial the construction of new streams of care for young people in transition to adulthood.",

      "abstract": "Chez l'humain, les dépressions, dont la dépression post-partum, sont regroupées dans la catégorie « Trouble de l'humeur non spécifié ». Les causes de la dépression sont nombreuses et multifactorielles, d'ordre endocrinien, environnemental, social, affectif, psychologique. Quel qu'en soit l'effet déclencheur, la dépression s'accompagne toujours d'un dérèglement biochimique responsable de nombreux symptômes : anhédonie, anorexie ou hyperphagie, hyper- ou insomnie, perte de poids significative (< 5 %), agitation ou prostration, altération de la vie sociale, etc. L'élaboration d'une revue de littérature prépare la présentation d'un cas clinique de femelle orang-outan. L'étude de l'influence des facteurs biologiques et des agents stressants, tels que environnementaux, sociaux et affectifs, sur l'humeur et ses troubles, étaye l'analyse des résultats obtenus. Née en captivité en Allemagne, gestante primipare lors de son transfert en France en février 1996, Jane, jeune femelle orang-outan de 13 ans a commencé à envoyer des signes de détresse au cours du 3e mois de vie de son nourrisson (vomissement, anorexie, prostration). Au fur et à mesure des semaines son état s'aggravant, elle laissa son jeune au soin d'une femelle plus âgée et expérimentée qu'elle. Puisque les résultats médicaux affichaient des constantes normales, Sébastien Laurent, le directeur du parc commença à la masser, la coiffer, la forcer à manger et à la stimuler. Durant huit mois, chaque jour, il lui consacrait ce temps individualisé. Au fur et à mesure des soins, l'état de Jane s'améliora. Au neuvième mois, elle redevint entièrement autonome. Dans la dépression post-partum, le facteur stress jouerait un rôle fondamental dans le dérèglement de l'axe corticotrope, l'activation de la réponse inflammatoire et le syndrome de basse T3. La perte des repères familiers, l'absence de soutien, l'isolement familial ou social, la détresse affective sont des facteurs de stress indiscutables chez l'humain. Le cas clinique de Jane permet de confirmer que son arrivée dans ce nouveau zoo a pu provoquer un stress à l'origine de son désarroi. La massothérapie, l'attention individualisée, et le temps partagé avec un référent sécure et contenant, furent les outils psychothérapiques enrayant le processus dépressif. Les recherches médicales actuelles démontrent les effets positifs des massages au niveau de la diminution du taux de cortisol (hormone du stress) de 31 % et l'augmentation de sérotonine de 28 % et de dopamine de 31 % (neurotransmetteurs du bien-être), à l'issue de massothérapie.",

Die Diagnose einer somatoformen Störung stützt sich auf psychologische Kriterien und das Fehlen typischer Zeichen und Symptome einer organischen Grunderkrankung. Viele Patienten weisen eine psychiatrische Komorbidität mit depressiven und Angststörungen sowie Persönlichkeitsstörungen auf. Somatoforme Störungen bei organ-neurologischen Erkrankungen sind nicht selten und können zu diagnostischen Problemen führen.

      "abstract": "A patient’s need for life-sustaining treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) has significant and enduring effects on the patient’s family. The impact of critical illness extends beyond the patient and exposes family members of critically ill patients to psychologically taxing conditions. Several studies have established that family members of the critically ill are at risk for heightened states of psychological morbidity. Symptoms of acute stress, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported among family members more than 6 months following a patient’s admission to an ICU.The impact of critical illness on the patient’s family system has been recognized as a significant clinical problem, which resulted in the term post–intensive care syndrome–family (PICS-F). This term reflects adverse psychological symptoms among family members of the critically ill owing to the patient’s severity of illness, uncertain prognosis, need for surrogate decision-making, and informal caregiving. The most common symptoms associated with PICS-F are anxiety, depression, and PTSD.Despite the growing attention on the impact of patients’ critical illness on their family members, the symptoms of PICS-F in family members of patients who have survived an initial episode of critical illness but continue to require life-sustaining care in a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) have not been explored. Therefore, the author of this study sought to identify the prevalence of PICS-F symptoms (eg, anxiety, depression, PTSD), coping behaviors, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in family decision makers of critically ill patients in an LTACH.The author of the EBR article conducted a single-center, longitudinal descriptive study to capture PICS-F symptoms, coping behaviors, and HRQOL in family decision makers of critically ill patients residing in an LTACH. Thirty family decision makers were recruited to participate and completed questionnaires to capture their levels of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and HRQOL at 3 time points: within the first week of the patient’s admission to the LTACH and approximately 30 and 60 days later. The interviews with participants were structured; the first interview was conducted in person and the subsequent interviews were conducted by telephone or by mailing out the questionnaires to the participants. In an effort to demonstrate appreciation of the participants’ time and efforts, participants received a $10 gift card each time they completed a set of questionnaires.The findings indicate that family members of critically ill patients residing in an LTACH have symptoms of PICS-F and significant reductions in HRQOL. At the patient’s admission to the LTACH, 27% and 20% of family members reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression that modestly dissipated across 60 days. In terms of coping behaviors, problem- focused coping behaviors decreased over time, but use of avoidant and emotion-focused coping behaviors remained stable. Family members reported slightly lower states of HRQOL compared with the general population of adults. In summary, PICS-F symptoms are present in family members of LTACH patients, and the intensity of PICS-F symptoms may influence the activation of coping behaviors and the HRQOL reported by family members of LTACH patients.Amy Petrinec, rn, phd, author of the EBR article, provides additional information about the study. She explains that, as a novice critical care nurse, families were not always her first concern and she often focused on the tasks associated with the patient’s care. Dr Petrinec notes that the current study builds on the foundational evidence generated in her dissertation research, which explored the associations among stress, coping, and PTSD symptoms. It seemed to be a logical next step to explore PICS-F symptoms in family members of critically ill patients when discharged to an LTACH, she remarks.According to Dr Petrinec, the majority of LTACH patients have experienced a recent admission to an ICU. “Having knowledge of the symptoms that may occur in family members across the patient’s illness trajectory may alert nurses to prompt conversations about helpful resources for family members,” she comments. She hopes that her article helps to shed light on the experiences and psychological morbidity of family members, and importantly, remind critical care nurses that empathy and caring are essential components of family- centered critical care.The study findings establish the presence of PICS-F symptoms and modest reductions in HRQOL among family members of patients in an LTACH. Dr Petrinec encourages readers of the American Journal of Critical Care to assess for the presence of PICS-F symptoms and implement evidence-based nursing care that can attenuate these symptoms in family members of critically ill patients in an ICU or an LTACH.“My research is laying the descriptive groundwork from which future interventions can address PICS-F symptoms,” says Dr Petrinec. Looking ahead, she plans to focus her future research on screening family members to deliver timely intervention to mitigate the risk for PICS among family members.This feature briefly describes the personal journey and background story of the EBR article’s investigators, discussing the circumstances that led them to undertake the line of inquiry represented in the research article featured in this issue.Amy Petrinec, rn, phd, is an assistant professor at Kent State University College of Nursing in Kent, Ohio. She has nearly 3 decades of clinical nursing experience in providing care to critically ill patients and their families. As a nurse scientist, Dr Petrinec examines the untoward psychological symptoms that occur among family members of critically ill adults. She recently completed a postdoctoral fellowship that expanded her research focus to include PICS-F symptoms among family members of patients residing in an LTACH.This study was conducted while Dr Petrinec was a postdoctoral fellow. She remarks that she learned several valuable lessons while carrying out this study. Throughout the data collection process, she comments, multiple barriers were encountered. “It was reminiscent of working as a clinical instructor with nursing students in an ICU and remembering that you are a guest,” Dr Petrinec notes about the unexpected barriers she encountered while conducting the study.When conducting research, patience is critical, says Dr Petrinec. Getting a foothold in a new facility takes a great deal of perseverance with episodic progress, she adds. Identifying a suitable mentor and then maintaining regular communication is essential to help a novice investigator navigate the complexities of conducting research in a clinical setting, Dr Petrinec continues. “There are many pitfalls that a seasoned investigator can help to avoid,” she adds.",

      "title": "Feeling the Blues",
      "abstract": "KUGATHASANDepression is a widespread illness that affects people regardless of age, nationality, race, and gender.Nearly everyone has feelings of blue moods at some point in their lives.It is when these feelings persist, recur, or become severe that one may be experiencing depression and should seek medical help.People with a depressive illness cannot merely \"pull themselves together\" and get better.Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years and it can be debilitating.Fortunately, today, there is a wide range of medications and therapies available to treat depression.A complex interplay of factors involving genetics, stress, and changes in body and brain function are thought to play a role in the development of depression (Kaufman, 2001).One of the reasons that depression is so common is because the illness may develop for a variety of reasons.A recent study suggests that abnormalities of the hippocampus may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression (Posener et al, 2003).The exact causes of depression are still in question, but scientists have identified certain risk factors that could increase the likelihood of one becoming depressed Family history of depression, stressful situations such as a death in the family or relationship troubles, dependence on alcohol or drugs, medical conditions such as diabetes or cancer, and other mental illnesses are all risk factors that could lead to depression.Depression can take many forms.What differentiates these forms are the severity and duration of the symptoms.However, there often is not a clear distinction between these different types of depression, since they frequently share many of the same characteristics.The different types of depression can be classified as minor depression or dysthymia, major depression, and manic depression (bipolar disorder), and within each of these main categories there are several subtypes.Major depression, sometimes called clinical depression, is the most common form of depression.It is characterized by a mood change that lasts more than two weeks and includes one or both primary signs of depression: overwhelming feelings of sadness or grief, and loss of interest or pleasure in usually enjoyable activities (Kaufman, 2001).People with major depression may also experience recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, feelings of worthlessness, impaired thinking or concentration, insomnia, feeling tired all the time, significant weight loss or gain.These symptoms may differ from person to person as well as from one depressive episode to the next.For example, some people may have insomnia and lose weight while depressed, whereas others may oversleep, overeat and gain weight (Madison Institute of Medicine).In addition, major depression can range from mild to severe, with varying intensity of symptoms.In extreme cases, people with severe depression may be unable to work or care for themselves.Although major depression is the most common form of depression, approximately 26 per cent of individuals with major depression also suffer from chronic minor depression or dsythymia (Harkness et al, 2002).Dysthymia is a long-lasting form of mild depression characterized by a persistently gloomy outlook.Dysthymia generally lasts for at least two years and sometimes more than five years (Mayclinic.com).It usually isn't as disabling as major depression and periods of dysthymia may alternate with intervals of feeling normal.Signs and symptoms of dysthymia are like those of major depression but not as intense (Rapaport et al, 2002).",

      "title": "A Psychoanalytic Study on the Abnormal Behavior of Muzong emperor in Liao Dynasty",
      "abstract": "초록·키워드 목차 오류제보하기 Muzong in Liao Dynasty suffered from borderline personality disorder due to various negative environmental factors during the growth process and after the emperor\"s ascension, and schizophrenia was more pronounced in his later years in office. Mokjong was so capricious that he got angry or brutally slaughtered the Valets (近侍). In addition, drinking too much and sleeping resulted in more days of not attending the meeting, and officials were appointed in a drunken state. As a result, the political situation became unstable due to the lack of administrative efficiency and the loss of national territory by passive response in foreign relations. He shows a psychopathic phenomenon called borderline personality disorder. A person with borderline personality disorder experiences a sense of confusion about himself, showing various protruding behaviors that are hard to predict because stable self-image has not been established. He was self-indulgent and self-indulgent, war, and sexual dysfunction, depending on alcohol, but he was more drunk and destroyed himself in a vicious cycle of shame and guilt caused by moral anxiety. Eventually, he is killed by people who serves close (近侍) who were subject to murder. As such, the impact of a human growth process on an individual is absolute. Abnormal behavior and mental disorder are the products of such painful and unhappy past experiences, as well as the causes that make life painful and unhappy. This could bring misfortune to society and the nation, not only to the parties but also to their families and people around them. In particular, it was inevitable that the absolute monarch of feudal society would fall in national power and endanger the country, as he was acting strangely due to psychological disorder, wrong decision-making, and disorderly conduct, so that his subjects could not control the monarch. #요 목종 #수왕 #근시 살해 #정신분석 #경계선성격장애 #遼 穆宗 #睡王 #近侍殺害 #情神分析 #境界線性格障礙 #Muzong emperor in Liao Dynasty #sleeping king #slaughter of Valets #psychoanalysis #borderline personality disorder Ⅰ. 머리말Ⅱ. 목종의 가계도 및 그 생애Ⅲ. 목종의 이상행동과 그 원인Ⅳ. 맺음말참고문헌Abstract",

      "title": "Theoretical Perspectives on Mental Health and Illness: Introduction to Part I",
      "abstract": "Mental health and mental disorder represent two different areas of theory, research, and policy implications, reflecting our common tendency to dichotomize healthy and sick, normal and abnormal, sane and insane. David Mechanic (2006) argues that the term “mental health” has no clear or consistent meaning, and in terms of the sociological literature, this is generally true. Mental health is not merely the absence of disease or disorder; it involves self-esteem, mastery, and the ability to maintain meaningful relationships with others. While most of us fall short of optimal well-being (or happiness), those who experience mental health problems or psychological distress have been the focus of most sociological research. However, definitions of mental health problems, illnesses, or disorders are also not so straightforward. Following Horwitz (2002b), “mental diseases” reflect underlying internal dysfunctions that have universal features (i.e. schizophrenia and to a lesser degree bipolar disorder). A valid “mental disorder” reflects some internal psychological system that is unable to function as it should, and this dysfunction is socially inappropriate. For most disorders, symptoms are not specific indicators of discrete, underlying diseases (such as schizophrenia), instead many conditions arise from stressful social conditions (such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders). Cultural processes shape the symptoms associated with mental disorders, and it is important to distinguish mental disorders from normal reactions to social stressors. Horwitz (2002b) uses the terminology of “mental illness” to refer to those conditions which a particular group has defined as a mental illness (and often point to behaviors that are deemed deviant, for example homosexuality in previous psychiatric classifications). For simplicity, we will use the term mental health problem or disorder in this introduction – but students should keep in mind the implications of using the term mental illness. In Chapter 1, Horwitz argues that sociological approaches regard mental health and mental health problems as aspects of social circumstances. He provides a very thorough overview of how various social conditions affect levels of mental health and mental health problems, and in turn how social contexts shape the definition as well as the response to mental health problems. Chapter 1 develops a framework for a sociological understanding of mental disorder and mental health problems and also directs the reader to other chapters in the volume that illustrate Horwitz's arguments.",

Individuals with GAD often have other disorders including other psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder), substance use disorder, obesity, and may have a history of trauma or family with GAD. As per Aacharya Charaka Generalized Anxiety Disorder can be correlated with the Chittodwega (Excited state of mind) which is type of Manovikara (disease of mind). The contemporary management of this disease employs anxiolytics to be used in long run which is not conducive to health. As per this view cannabis stands as ‘Holy Grail’ in the treatment of anxiety or mood disorders without eliciting any anxiogenic effects even in higher dose. This is a case of 57 year old women who presented with persistent anxiety and inability to relax. Based on signs and symptoms he was diagnosed as a case of GAD according to the ICD 10 F41.1 criteria. Treatment planned was low dose of oral medical cannabis tincture. Assessment of the condition of the patient before and after the treatment was done using Hamilton’s Anxiety Rating Scale to evaluate efficacy of treatment. After the completion of schedule of 3 month of treatment, a significant reduction in score from 20 to 12 on Hamilton’s Anxiety Rating Scale and improvement in symptoms was observed.",

The disease can have a profound impact on life quality in terms of physical, social and psychological well-being. It has a great detrimental effect on our social and economic stability as the disease is more severe in men than in women. Work disability in AS patients is higher than expected in the general population for both male and female. Patients with AS may incur significant medical costs which accelerate steeply with increasing loss of function (BASFI) and disease activity (BASDAI). Patients with more severe disease activity are at greater risk for developing functional disability. AS influences the subjective health of the affected person, especially the physical health related QoL. BASFI, BASDAI, BASG and pain are significantly associated with SF-36 physical and mental domains in patients with AS. Pain, fatigue and stiffness are the most commonly reported symptoms of these patients.

The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

In Malaysia, psychiatric disorders were responsible for 8.6% of the total Disability Adjusted Life Years and were ranked fourth as the leading cause of burden of disease by disease categories1. More and more evidence shows that physical illnesses are strongly associated with psychiatric disorders. Those with physical illnesses have much higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders compared to that without2-3. The mechanisms of co-morbidity of psychiatric and physical illness are complex. It is a two-way interaction and there are five different possible ways to describe this4-5. Co-incidence or By-chance In clinical practice, the psychiatric illness may be coincidental and unrelated to physical problems, as both physical and psychiatric conditions are common in the general population. Such disorders do, however, complicate the management of the physical illness. For example, depression can predate the onset of the medical illness in up to 25% of patients with co morbid depression, and it is associated with an increase in somatic complaints5. Common cause for both Here, either patient factors or non-disease factors may have given rise to both; for example, stressful life events in a vulnerable person may precipitate both a stroke and a depressive illness6.",

      "title": "Treatment non-compliance with antipsychotics in Pakistan",
      "abstract": "Psychosis refers to symptoms affecting the mind due to loss of contact with reality. It can disrupt a person's thoughts and they might experience hallucinations or delusions. This altered sense of reality can significantly affect everyday activities and the ability to maintain relationships. Psychosis is not a diagnosis, rather a symptom of various mental health conditions. About one in every 150 individuals is affected by psychotic disorders at least once in their lifetime.1 Antipsychotics are used to control psychotic symptoms and the duration of the therapy depends on the severity of illness. For short-term psychoses such as delirium, medications are continued for two additional weeks after symptoms resolve and then tapered off gradually. With chronic schizophrenia, antipsychotics are usually taken permanently to avoid recurrence.2 However, in countries such as Pakistan, where with low literacy and social stigma associated with mental illnesses, many patients discontinue their antipsychotic therapy due to various factors.3 Many of these reasons have been discussed by Rao et al4, including patient-related, and healthcare system-related factors. Denial, lack of awareness, financial constraints, adverse effects of the medicines, and complex regimens, all contribute to patients' non-adherence. Insufficient training of doctors, poor patient management, and long waiting times for appointments can contribute to a poor doctor-patient relationship, which leading to negative patient outcomes. One important factor is the side effect profile of antipsychotics. They can cause extrapyramidal effects like akathisia, parkinsonism, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia. Weight gain, sedation, blurring of vision, postural hypotension, prolactin elevation, and constipation are also common.5 Such effects make it difficult to continue therapy without seriously affecting the lifestyle of patients. Discontinuation prevents patients from fully benefiting from the medication, leading to persistent or recurrent psychosis. Hence it is of utmost importance for the Pakistani healthcare system to come up with a method that ensures continuation of therapy among our population. Healthcare providers should patients to join relevant support groups to help them cope with the emotional aspects of their illness. Although developing medications with fewer side effects is challenging, it could help address one of the most common reasons for non-adherence. Further research is needed to address the factors contributing to non-adherence.",

Thirty patients have been studied with this discharge as the chief complaint and 8 patients presenting various nervous complaints in addition. These patients usually showed few or no pus cells in urethral or prostatic smears. Patients have been reported only in whom a definite psychiatric diagnosis was possible, as follows in order of frequency: reactive depression, anxiety state, hysteria, prepsychotic personality, and psychopathic personality. Previous personality characteristics were frequently as follows: excessive conscientiousness, excessive shyness, tendency to drift on the line of least resistance, hypochondriasis, and excessive dependency. Usually the sexual activity was that of continence with an occasional lapse always followed by guilt feelings. The discharge often developed after a period of continence with temptation, excepting in a proportion of cases in which it represented the persistence of an originally infective discharge. Its onset or persistence could usually be correlated with the psychiatric history. Twenty-eight patients were given psychiatric treatment, mostly psychotherapy at a fairly superficial level. Short term follow-up indicated improvement in the local condition as well as the psychiatric disorder, although failures occurred and risks were involved. Probable mechanisms have been discussed in relation to the relevant literature.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins. A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities. Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement; small, frequent meals; and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms.",

      "abstract": "With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.",

      "abstract": "A comprehensive medical evaluation includes a thorough history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory, imaging and other studies. An important portion of the history in a primary care evaluation is the psychiatric history and the mental status examination. When evaluating a patient for mental or emotional disorders, history is truly everything. Often, the practitioner must ask specific questions to assess the presence of common mental disorders in order to supplement other information or because the patient does not recognize or does not volunteer the symptoms. Casting ones net for the symptoms of common mental disorders, including the category of anxiety disorders, is extremely helpful to fully assess a patient’s emotional and physical status. Disorders that comorbidly occur may further complicate matters, especially if common symptoms are shared. For example, shared symptoms of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder include worrying, poor concentration, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and somatic concerns.

Muchos pacientes con dolor crónico desarrollan una depresión comórbida; utilizan la atención médica en exceso y se sienten agraviados por los cuidados que reciben; muchos dejan su trabajo, obtienen una discapacidad y se instalan en un estilo de vida que, en el mejor de los casos, se parece poco al que una vez imaginaron que era posible. El dolor crónico se ve influido por numerosos factores psicosociales, entre los que se encuentran los factores biológicos, así como el entorno sociocultural del paciente, sus creencias, sus expectativas y sus emociones (Turk y Okifuji, 2002). Las tasas de éxito del tratamiento médico son elevadas para los pacientes con dolor agudo, pero son decepcionantes para los pacientes con dolor crónico no maligno. Las fuentes más comunes de dolor no relacionado con el cáncer incluyen (en frecuencia decreciente) la espalda, la cabeza, las articulaciones, las extremidades, el pecho, el abdomen y otras zonas. Dado que la mayoría de los pacientes con dolor crónico experimentan dolor en múltiples áreas, la mayoría de los profesionales médicos se esfuerzan por evaluar y tratar todas las fuentes de dolor y mantenerse dentro de las limitaciones de tiempo de las tan ocupadas consultas de atención primaria. Muchos pacientes son derivados a especialistas y se someten a procedimientos costosos, infructuosos e invasivos, a menudo de forma repetida...",

      "title": "Pseudopheochromocytoma",
      "abstract": "Introduction Pseudopheochromocytoma is a rare but often disabling syndrome of paroxysmal severe hypertension and symptoms of catecholamine excess, including feelings of anxiety, tremor, sweating and palpitations [1]. In some patients, other features are also present including chest pain, headache, nausea, dizziness, pseudoseizures and paradoxically low blood pressures. Episodes tend to have rapid onset and last from a few minutes up to a few hours and be followed by intense fatigue that can last for several days. During episodes, many patients feel as though they 'might die'. Although many of the presenting features of pseudopheochromocytoma resemble those of pheochromocytoma, the main difference is that there is no definite anatomical or biochemical abnormality, although evidence of mild to moderate catecholamine excess may be present, particularly during paroxysms. Other reported biochemical abnormalities in pseudopheochromocytoma include elevated peripheral plasma dopamine sulphate levels [2] but these are not present in all patients. Pseudopheochromocytoma has clinical similarities with both Page's syndrome [3] ('hypertensive diencephalic syndrome') which was first described in 1935, and autonomic epilepsy which is occasionally associated with tumours or cysts in the thalamic region [4] but can occur as an unexplained entity. To date, no anatomical thalamic abnormalities have been confirmed in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma. Psychological aspects Pseudopheochromocytoma is largely a diagnosis of exclusion, which requires careful screening for any treatable pheochromocytoma before the diagnosis is made. There is considerable overlap between pseudopheochromocytoma and panic disorder conditions and it is not known to what extent psychological factors can influence the often severe acute rise in blood pressure seen in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma during paroxysms. Indeed, pseudopheochromocytoma has been associated with a history of traumatic psychological experiences during childhood or a tendency to suppress distressing emotions, and psychotherapy has been useful in relieving symptoms in many patients [5]. Multifactorial causes Increasingly, we are realizing that in most complex disorders, including hypertension, it is the exception to find a unifactorial cause and in the vast majority of cases, a large number of factors act together to influence the development of the condition in any one individual. The same is likely to be true in pseudopheochromocytoma, where many different factors, including both somatic and supratentorial elements, probably interplay in any one patient to cause the clinical syndrome. It is also likely that there is heterogeneity among patients, with differences in the severity and clinical features which lead to the label of pseudopheochromocytoma. Secondary causes of pseudopheochromocytoma-like symptoms When assessing a patient with pseudopheochromocytoma-like symptoms, it is important to ascertain whether the syndrome may be secondary to another condition, e.g. obstructive sleep apnoea [6] or drug therapy, e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, sympathomimetic agents or reboxetine [7] all of which can raise sympathetic activity. Other conditions aside from pheochromocytoma that can present in a similar way to pseudopheochromocytoma include systemic mastocytosis, cocaine use and reninoma. Sympathoadrenal function in pseudopheochromocytoma In the current issue of the Journal, Sharabi et al. [8] have published one of the largest series of patients with pseudopheochromocytoma in the literature to date and have attempted to unravel some of the mechanisms underlying the condition, by studying the role of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal function in pseudopheochromocytoma. This was a difficult study to do, partly due to difficulty recruiting patients with the true condition but also due to uncertainty as to what the primary endpoint should be, according to which the study should be powered. As a result of this, many measurements were made, with no single primary outcome measure defined. Plasma catecholamine levels and haemodynamic parameters were measured following the administration of various pharmacological manipulators of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal function in a group of 11 patients with pseudopheochromocytoma and 14 healthy controls. Baseline levels of plasma catecholamines and metanephrine, the O-methylated metabolite of epinephrine, were also measured and functional imaging of the adrenal medulla was performed using the positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer [18F]fluorodopamine. Pharmacological manipulation of sympathoadrenal function The pharmacological agents administered in the study were as follows: the ganglion blocker trimethaphan, which is a competitive antagonist at nicotinic cholinergic receptors at autonomic ganglia and inhibits both sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow; yohimbine, which is a competitive α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, which increases adrenal production of epinephrine and norepinephrine by binding to preganglionic α2-adrenoceptors and blocking the negative feedback inhibition of catecholamine production; isoproterenol which is a β-adrenoceptor agonist; and glucagon which stimulates epinephrine production. Results The main findings of the current study were of increased adrenal epinephrine release and increased circulatory responses to catecholamines in the patients with pseudopheochromocytoma. In the current study, patients with pseudopheochromocytoma had higher baseline plasma epinephrine levels but similar norepinephrine levels to controls. In contrast, a previous study showed no difference between baseline plasma epinephrine or norepinephrine levels in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma and controls [9]. No abnormality in adrenomedullary function was observed on [18F]fluorodopamine PET scanning in the patients with pseudopheochromocytoma. Ganglion blockers When interpreting the effects of the ganglion blockade by trimethaphan, it is worth bearing a few points in mind. First, trimethaphan, in addition to blocking the autonomic ganglia, causes histamine release, unlike the alternative ganglion blocker, pentolinium. Trimethaphan also has a shorter half-life than pentolinium. Pentolinium is sometimes used as a diagnostic suppression test in the investigation of patients with possible pheochromocytoma [10]. The effects of ganglion blockade depend upon the level of preganglionic stimulation. Pentolinium is good at suppressing physiological elevations of epinephrine but has less effect if epinephrine levels are normal at baseline. In contrast, clonidine, which is also used as a suppression test in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, is not very effective in suppressing epinephrine, but suppresses norepinephrine levels well. The authors did not include the pentolinium suppression test as an evaluation of the pseudopheochromocytoma patients included in this study. In the current study, the results in response to trimethaphan are somewhat surprising in that there was a lesser fall in norepinephrine levels in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma than in controls. This could be explained by the fact that the pseudopheochromocytoma patients started with significantly lower baseline levels of norepinephrine than the controls and ganglion blockers are less effective at lowering norepinephrine levels from a lower baseline level. With regard to epinephrine levels, if as the authors suggest, there are higher baseline epinephrine levels in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma, one might expect to see an exaggerated drop in epinephrine levels in response to trimethaphan administration; however, the authors did not report the changes in epinephrine levels with trimethaphan. Potential role of dopamine in pseudopheochromocytoma The role of dopamine in pseudopheochromocytoma was not directly assessed in this study. Dopamine sulphate levels were found to be three-fold elevated in patients with pseudopheochromocytoma in one study [2] but in patients in the current study, plasma dopamine levels were normal. It is also known that dopamine antagonists can induce hypertensive crisis in patients with pheochromocytoma by blocking the presynaptic negative inhibition of norepinephrine release. Anecdotally, we have had some success in improving the symptoms of pseudopheochromocytoma by using low doses of the dopamine agonist cabergoline; however, the unproven benefits would need to be weighed against the reported association between some dopamine agonists and cardiac valvular fibrosis when used at high doses. Role of adrenoceptor sensitivity in pseudopheochromocytoma A previous study by Hamada et al.[9] showed that patients with pseudopheochromocytoma had a significantly greater systolic blood pressure response to a valsalva manoeuvre than patients with pheochromocytoma, essential hypertension or normal controls. The systolic blood pressure rise was suppressed by the prior administration of non-selective β-blockade or α1-blockade. They concluded that patients with pseudopheochromocytoma had β and α1-adrenoceptor hypersensitivity. It is known that β-blockers and α1-blockers relieve symptoms in some patients with pseudopheochromocytoma. Interestingly, while α-blockers are the mainstay of medical therapy for pheochromocytoma (sometimes combined with β-blockade depending on the degree of tachycardia on α-blockade, which is often related to the amount of epinephrine production), patients with pseudopheochromocytoma tend to have a slightly better response to β-blockade, although often α1-blockade is used in combination. Antidepressants may also have a role in the management of pseudopheochromocytoma. Conclusions While the current study represents an important addition to the limited literature on pseudopheochromocytoma, unfortunately it has not yet fully explained the mechanisms of pseudopheochromocytoma or provided any specific diagnostic test for the condition. The findings support the use of α-blockade and β-blockade in the management of patients with pseudopheochromocytoma but have not suggested any other possible treatments. The authors should, however, be congratulated on ascertaining and studying a cohort of patients with this rare but important condition. Further publications of well-phenotyped series of patients with pseudopheochromocytoma should be encouraged to help improve our understanding and treatment of the condition.",

      "abstract": "Chronic stable angina (CSA) is a cardinal symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD), charac‐ terized by pain or discomfort in the precordium, shoulder, back, arm, or jaw [1]. Angina pain symptoms—or equivalents such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and nausea—are considered stable if they are experienced over several weeks in the absence of major deterioration [1-3]. Those affected by CSA typically have CAD involving one or more large epicardial arteries, although individuals diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, endothe‐ lial dysfunction, or valvular stenosis/deficiencies may also exhibit angina [1]. Symptoms usually occur predictably upon physical exertion and are relieved by rest or nitroglycerin [1]. The severity of symptoms experienced can vary, typically ranging from Canadian Cardiovas‐ cular Society [CCS] class I to class III angina. A number of factors can also aggravate symptoms including heightened emotional states, diet, smoking, and weather [1,4].",

      "abstract": "Tidur merupakan kebutuhan penting bagi seorang individu, tidur menjadi indikator untuk pemulihan stamina dan pembentukan daya tahan tubuh. Diperlukan waktu 6-8 jam perhari agar mendapatkan kualitas tidur yang baik. Insomnia merupakan persepsi atau keluhan atas kualitas tidur yang buruk ditandai dengan kesulitan memulai tidur, mempertahankan tidur, dan terbangun terlalu dini di pagi hari yang dapat menyebabkan kelelahan, kecemasan, kurang konsentrasi, hingga depresi yang dapat mengganggu aktifitas harian. \r\nData prevalensi insomnia sangat beragam di indonesia 10% dari total penduduk mengalami gangguan sulit tidur atau insomnia dan 15% diantaranya adalah kasus insomnia kronis. Insomnia sendiri diklasifikasikan ke beberapa hal. Berdasarkan waktu insomnia terbagi menjadi insomnia transien, insomnia jangka pendek, dan insomnia kronis, sedangkan berdasarkan etiologinya insomnia dibedakan menjadi insomnia primer dan insomnia sekunder.\r\nDalam TCM insomnia dapat diakibatkan karena defisiensi Qi jantung dan kandung empedu yang bisa diakibatkan karena pola hidup yang kurang baik, terlalu lama menderita penyakit, atau mengkonsumsi obat terlalu sering sehingga dapat menguras Qi dan darah. Penanganan insomnia dapat dilakukan menggunakan terapi kombinasi pijat swedia, tuina dan nutrisi olahan daun kelor. Pemberian pijat kombinasi adalah untuk memberikan efek relaksasi dan memanipulasi langsung kedalam titik akupuntur sedangkan pemberian nutrisi olahan daun kelor sebagai asupan tambahan sehingga insomnia dapat berkurang. Terapi pijat dilakukan menggunakan teknik swedia pada seluruh tubuh dan teknik tuina pada beberapa titik akupuntur seperti Jueyinshu (BL14), Xinshu (BL15), Pishu (BL20), Weishu (BL21), Shenshu (BL23), Fengchi (GB20), Jianjing (GB 21), Yintang (EX-HN3), Taiyang (EX-HN5), Shenting (GV24), Jingming (BL1), Cuanzhu (BL2), dan Sibai (ST2) yang dilakukan 21 kali terapi. Terapi pijat dilakukan setiap hari selama 21 hari. Terapi nutrisi yang diberikan menggunakan olahan daun kelor (Moringa oleifera) yaitu sayur bening daun kelor yang diberikan kepada pasien dengan takaran 238 gram per hari.

Measures of health-related QOL assess health perception as well as physical, emotional and social function, and this is referred to as functional status. Such measurement is now considered to be a key factor in the assessment of patients with conditions such as functional dyspepsia, where there is chronic or recurrent unexplained pain or discomfort centred in the upper abdomen. QOL measures may be used to try and discriminate among a number of disease groups or to assess change in disease status over time; different approaches are usually necessary to meet these goals.",

Getting sober from alcohol or other drugs is one of your first recovery tasks. If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream. You also have to stabilize the acute symptoms of your mood disorder, such as mania, depression, or suicidality. Otherwise, it will be harder to stop using substances.",

      "abstract": "There are many patients with chronic pain who are referred from each of the clinical fields to the department of psychosomatic medicine. Various psychosocial stress factors participate in the onset of chronic pain. Psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, anger, depression, hypersensitivity, or irritation, are often related to the onset of chronic pain and change the state of illness. Chronic pain of the musculoskeletal system is often a pathologic reaction against the stress. Because a correlation between physical symptoms and psychological stress factors has been observed, chronic pain can be regarded as a representative form of psychosomatic disease. To improve efficacy in the medical treatment or psychotherapy, it is important to understand the psychosocial condition of chronic pain through sufficient history taking or appropriate psychological tests. For the pharmacological treatment of such chronic pain modified with psychosomatic factors, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be more effective than general analgesics or physical therapy. Holistic and specialized approaches, such as cognitive therapy or behavioral therapy, may be necessary for the treatment of chronic pain related to improper recognition, obsessive ideas or misunderstanding of the problems.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is a major feature of the illness. Like many of the other aspects of the illness, however, it has not been studied extensively in older patients. Several studies of older patients with a lifetime course of poor outcome and chronic institutional stay have indicated that some patients manifest evidence of profound cognitive impairments on a cross-sectional basis and cognitive and functional decline over longitudinal follow-ups of 30 months or longer. Risk factors for this decline include lower educational attainment and more severe positive symptoms, but do not include more severe symptoms of physical illness. These impairments have been shown to be discriminable from normal age-related changes and from the changes associated with Alzheimer's Disease. In contrast, studies of patients with no history of lifetime institutional stay find no such evidence of either age-related changes in cognitive functioning or longitudinal decline in cognitive or functional status. Since there is accumulating evidence of progressive brain changes over the lifespan in patients with schizophrenia, the course of cognitive deficits in later life will remain an important topic, both for understanding the lifetime course of schizophrenia and for developing interventions aimed at reduction of disability in the illness.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain, which can potentially develop from acute pain, subacute pain, or breakthrough pain, is generally defined as pain persisting for greater than three months with minimal relief. Chronic pain can be associated with a myriad of medical conditions. It is also one of the most common causes of disability, physical suffering, depression, and reduced quality of life. Treatment can vary depending on the underlying pathophysiology and can involve physical therapy, non-pharmaceutical approaches, pharmaceutical drugs, and invasive procedures. Currently available pharmaceutical agents have been effective for short-term management of chronic pain conditions, but few options address chronic pain with long-term efficacy. First-line pharmaceutical agents can potentially include over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription-strength non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which have been linked to numerous side effects. If chronic pain persists, steroids are frequently used to provide longer relief. For more progressive or resistant chronic pain and/or in conjunction with invasive procedures, opioids have been utilized for acute treatment and for long-term maintenance. While these agents have proven to be effective for both acute and long-term use due to their modulation at various peripheral and central opioid receptors, they can be associated with numerous side effects and tied to the risk of addiction. As such, an unmet need exists to identify treatment modalities that provide opioid-like pain relief without opioid-induced adverse effects and the potential for addiction. This narrative review will provide an overview of the currently available treatment modalities for chronic pain and their adverse event profiles, as well as a review of therapies that are currently in development and/or preclinical trials for the management and treatment of chronic pain.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a major public health problem, affecting \napproximately 1.3 ± 0.2 % of the Mexican population. In addition \nto the subjects personal suffering, bipolar disorders places \nsubstantial burdens on health care services, families, caregivers \nand employers. In the World Health Organization’s Global Burden \nof Disease study, bipolar disorder ranked sixth among all medical \ndisorders in years of life lost to death or disability. \nBipolar depression, or the depressive phase of bipolar disorder, \nrepresents a difficult- to- treat and disabling form of depression. \nHowever, in regard to its impact, an insufficient number of studies \nhave explored its treatment. Studies indicate that patients with \nbipolar disorder spend more time in treatment and take longer to \nrecover from the depressive phase that from the manic phase. \nPatients with bipolar disorder, experience depressive symptoms \nmore than 3 times more longer than they experience manic \nsymptoms. The median time to recovery from the depressive phase \nis 9 weeks but from the manic phase is 5 weeks; 22 % of the \npatients in the depressive phase and only 7 % in the manic phase \nremained ill for at least 1 year. The median time to full remission \nis 16.8 weeks for a manic episode but 40 weeks for a depressive \nepisode. In addition to being longer and more persistent, the \ndepressive phase of bipolar disorder is associated with higher \nrates of morbidity and mortality. The relative risk of suicide \namong patients with bipolar depression is 34.9 times greater than \nthat among patients with pure mania. Despite the clear clinical \nimplications of these findings, treatment of bipolar depression \nremains an understudied area, as clinicians and researchers have \nhistorically focused on treatment of mania. Although a wide \nrange of mood-stabilizing medications is available, treatment \noptions for bipolar depression remain more limited. The 2002 \ntreatment guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association \nrecommended either lithium or lamotrigine as first-line treatment. \nAlthough reviews of clinical trials have concluded that there is \nevidence of lithium’s acute efficacy for bipolar depression, \nanticonvulsants such as lamotrigine and valproate have also been \nused to treat bipolar depression. However, lamotrigine requires a \nslow upward titration to avoid the risk of rash. Other treatments \ninclude the adjunctive use of antidepressants with a mood \nstabilizer. However, antidepressants, may cause problems due to \ntheir potential to induce mania or hypomania or to accelerate \ncycling. \nThis paper reviews controlled studies of bipolar depression, \noutlines criteria for choosing treatment, and provides options for \ntreatment of refractory bipolar depression. The author conducted \na comprehensive review of English-language literature describing \npeer- reviewed and quality class A controlled trials in order to \nidentify agents used for bipolar disorder. Controlled studies to \nexamine the efficacy of treatments for acute bipolar depression \nwere located through electronic searches of several databases and \nby manual cross search of references and proceedings of \ninternational meetings. Lithium: There are no double-blind, \nparallel-design, placebo-controlled studies that have examined \nthe efficacy of lithium monotherapy in comparison with placebo \nin acute bipolar depression. However, the efficacy of lithium was \nexamined in three placebo-controlled cross-over studies and all \nof them showed lithium’s superiority over placebo. Available \ndata supports the efficacy of lithium in acute bipolar depression. \nValproate: A recent placebo-controlled, parallel-design study, \nexamined the efficacy of valproate monotherapy. Intent-to-treat \nanalysis indicated that 43 % of the subjects randomized to \nvalproate and 27 % randomized to placebo met criteria for \nrecovery (p= .04), but mean change from baseline in HAM-D \nscores were similar at the end-point to the placebo group. The \nnegative findings in this study could be due to a smaller sample \nsize, so this suggests the efficacy of valproate in acute bipolar \ndepression but this needs to be verified in further larger- scale \ndouble- blind trials. Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine has some \nefficacy, but further studies are needed before firm conclusions \ncan be drown. Lamotrigine: In the largest double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel study of bipolar depression to date, the \nlamotrigine 200 mg/day group showed a significantly greater \nimprovement compared with the placebo group on the \nMontgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the \nClinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. In another \n10-weekdouble-blind trial in bipolar I and bipolar II depressed \npatients, above all, no significant differences were noted using \nlast observation carried forward (LOCF). However, a subgroup \nanalysis revealed significant differences favoring lamotrigine in \nbipolar I but not in bipolar II depressed patients. The efficacy of \nlamotrigine in preventing depressive episodes in bipolar I disorder \nwas examined in two recent double-blind placebo-controlled \nstudies. In one of the studies, patients with bipolar I disorder \nwho were currently or recently in a manic or hypomanic phase \nwere treated with lamotrigine monotherapy or add on therapy to \nother psychotropic medications. Survival analysis showed that \nlamotrigine was significantly superior to placebo in time, for any \nmood episode or depressive episode. In the other study, bipolar I \ndepressed patients were treated in an open-label design with \nlamotrigine monotherapy or add on therapy and those meeting \nthe stabilization criteria were randomized to double-blind \ntreatment with one of three fixed doses of lamotrigine \nmonotherapy, lithium monotherapy or placebo for 18 months. \nResults using survival analysis indicated that lamotrigine was \nsignificantly superior to placebo in delaying time of intervention \nfor any mood episode or a depressive episode. The results of these \ntwo double-blind trials clearly indicate that lamotrigine is effective \nin delaying depressive relapses and recurrences in bipolar I patients. \nThere is no evidence to indicate that lamotrigine induces rapid \ncycling in bipolar patients. Gabapentine: The efficacy of gabapentine \nmonotherapy in comparison with lamotrigine or placebo was \nexamined over a 6-week period in patients with refractory mood \ndisorders. The results of this study indicate that lamotrigine is \neffective in 45 % of the patients, and gabapentine is no more \neffective than placebo in treating depressive symptoms. Topiramate: \nNo double-blind studies have been reported on the efficacy of \ntopiramate monotherapy in bipolar depression. Antidepressants: In \ndouble-blind active comparator studies, response rates to \nimipramina were comparable with the response rates to fluoxetine \nthrough significantly lower when compared with tranylcypromine. \nAtypical antipsychotics: Olanzapine is the only atypical antipsychotic \nthat has been tested for its efficacy in a double-blind, placebocontrolled trial in bipolar depression. Response rates were 48.2 % \nin the olanzapine group, 64.8 % in the olanzapine plus fluoxetine \ngroup, and 36.1 % in the placebo group. The results of this study \nindicate olanzapine’s monotherapy efficacy in treating acute bipolar \ndepression. \nConclusions: The literature reviewed above indicates that lithium \nis the only efficient medication in acute bipolar depression and in \npreventing depressive episodes, and that it has no propensity to \ninduce a manic switch or rapid cycling; also, it should be the firstline treatment for bipolar depression. Lamotrigine is also efficient \nin acute bipolar depression, and in preventing depressive episodes, \nbut its efficacy in preventing manic episodes has not been proven. \nThe magnitude of the antidepressant effect of olanzapine appears \nto be somewhat smaller than other established antidepressant \nmedications as well as lamotrigine. The other anticonvulsants, \nantidepressants, or atypical antipsychotics cannot be recommended \nas first-line treatments for bipolar depression.",

In both groups, the patient considers himself to be physically ill, despite the absence of organic findings. On the basis of the clinical examples, the psychodynamics of chronic pain is discussed with respect to primary and secondary epinosic gain, conscious and unconscious processes involving personal loss, proffered offences, desires and affects. In the absence of depressive symptoms, the psychological organization of pain can be understood as a substitution. Such a situation leads to a \"stabilization\" of the symptom and more prolonged chronicity than when depression presents at the same time, since in these patients, referral for psychotherapy is delayed.",

The individual is afraid that he or she will act in a way that will be humiliating or embarrassing. It is often a chronic, disabling condition that is characterized by a phobic avoidance of most social situations. Social anxiety disorder is the most frequent anxiety disorder (10-15%) that occurs in two subtypes--generalized and specific. It is a disorder that occurs during the adolescence and reflects negatively to the quality of life of an individual. Neurobiological basis of this disorder has not been explored yet. The disorder is frequently burdened with comorbidity with other anxiety disorders, depression and substance-related disorders. Only cognitive-behavioral techniques are desirable in the psychotherapeutic treatment of the disorder and the best results are achieved in combination with pharmacotherapy. The medicaments of choice in the treatment of social anxiety disorder are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Anxiolytics should be used only as a supplementary in the acute phase. Treatment of social anxiety disorder should last at least 3 months up to one year.",

The condition is multi-factorial, dependent on lifestyle, mood and personality, as well as on familial factors but no single factor in isolation is sufficient to explain the delay in sleep timing. Refusal to attend school may be important in some instances but will not explain cases with delayed age of onset. In half the subjects the delay in sleep phase started in childhood or adolescence. The syndrome causes severe disruption to education, work and family life. Polysomnography, motor activity monitoring of rest-activity cycles, plasma melatonin profiles and urinary melatonin metabolite excretion are normal. Different patterns of sleep phase delay seen in the syndrome include stable, progressive, irregular and non-24 hour sleep-wake cycles. These patterns may result from different social and other Zeitgebers (\"time-markers\", for example sunrise, sunset) in the normal environment. Treatment by forced sleep-wake phase advance or with melatonin resulted in a partial sleep-phase advance but this was not maintained on stopping treatment.",

However, blood gas analysis showed persistent hypoxia and hypercarbia, aggravating his ongoing mental state disturbance that required security supervision and sedation with antipsychotics and benzodiazepines.

Obstructive Sleep Apnoea is the most frequent respiratory sleep disorder. It involves repeated episodes of total (apnoea) or partial (hypopnea) obstruction at night. RLS or Willis-Ekbom disease is a relatively common pathology, with a prevalence of around 2.7%. It is underdiagnosed, which has a negative impact on both the quality of sleep and the patient's life. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are caused by desynchronization of the sleep/wake rhythm with the light/darkness cycle, generating an unbalanced sleep cycle. REM sleep behaviour disorder is characterised by abnormal repetitive behaviours, such as sleep-related vocalization and complex motor behaviours (intense and violent) during REM sleep, which can cause injuries or sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "title": "Medical-ethical guidelines: Care and treatment of people with dementia",
      "abstract": "The number of people with dementia in Switzerland is currently around 150,000. The prevalence of this condition rises steeply after the age of 65. As a result of demographic changes, the number of people affected in Switzerland is thus expected to increase markedly over the coming decades. The course of dementia – which frequently occurs in combination with chronic somatic and/or mental disorders (multimorbidity) – is often protracted and is difficult to predict. Cognitive impairments mean that self-determination and alleviation of symptoms are more difficult to achieve in everyday practice. People with severe dementia generally lack capacity, and decisions then have to be made by representatives on the basis of the patient’s previously expressed or presumed wishes. The management and care of patients may be complicated by disease-related behavioural disturbances. The public, as well as the individuals affected, are fearful of the loss of independence and possible changes in personality associated with progressive dementia; in addition, people are often afraid of becoming a burden on their relatives or society. Against this background, difficult decisions and significant ethical conflicts are not unusual – all the more so since life with dementia runs counter to guiding values, such as independence, productivity and rationality, which are central to our society. The aim of these guidelines is to offer practical guidance for dealing with ethical conflict situations relating to the care and treatment of people with dementia. Specific issues are addressed which may ultimately arise for all those involved in dementia care, irrespective of the setting (domestic, hospital, residential) and professional group. Which of these ethical issues is the most salient will depend largely on the stage of the condition. Once the condition has been diagnosed, management should be based on the principles that are also applicable, for example, in palliative care: a focus on quality of life, equality of care, interprofessional collaboration and continuity, open and appropriate communication, support for decision-making processes, anticipation, a multidimensional approach, and involvement of those close to the patient. These guidelines were prepared in cooperation with the Swiss Society of Gerontology (SGG SSG) as part of the National Dementia Strategy 2014–2019 (subproject 5.1: “Establishment of ethical guidelines”).",

      "title": "Kronična migrena kao socioekonomski problem današnjice",
      "abstract": "Chronic migraine (CM) is a disabling primary headache with the prevalence in the world between 0.9 to 5.1%. It is defined by ICHD-3 criteria as headache that lasts 15 or more days per month for at least 3 months while an 8 days headache per month fulfills the criteria for migraine. CM is typically a progressive episodic migraine (EM), ranging 2.5 – 3 % per year, with a slowly increase in headache frequency and migraine associated symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia). There are several risk factors that increase the risk of transformation in CM. One of them is the excessive use of medication, which initiated the discussion regarding the causal or consequential association with CM or with chronic daily headache (CDH). It is believed that CM is, among the four types of CDH, the most debilitating type of long duration CDH (the duration of seizures ≥4 hours), and also a most common form of CDH. Compared with episodic migraine, patients with CM have a significantly lower productivity and more frequent absences from work, school, social activities, and generally reduced quality of life. Also, compared to EM, CM patients visit physicians more often, either due to primary disease, or because of numerous comorbidities. It is estimated that the total cost is four times higher than in patients with EM. Pathophysiologically, frequent headache attacks induce pain modulation system and anatomical damage. As the frequency of headaches rises, the recovery of neurological functions between headache episodes becomes less sufficient. Unfortunately, CM is often an undiagnosed and untreated disorder. In therapy, multidisciplinary approach is essential. In addition to the mandatory prophylactic treatment for reducing migraine attacks, it is necessary to decrease risk factors and comorbidities and also to limit the intake of acute symptomatic drugs. ----- The aim of this paper is to emphasize the importance of socioeconomic aspect of CM through the comparison with EM, underlining the importance of risk factors in transformation into the CM. Also, this paper will present an overview of the changes in classification and nomenclature and give a review of the pathophysiological changes, diagnosis and treatment of CM, based on the most recent evidences.",

      "title": "La calidad de vida de los pacientes con dolor crónico y criterios de fragilidad en atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Introduccion El dolor cronico es una experiencia angustiosa asociada con dano tisular real o potencial con componentes sensitivos, emocionales, cognitivos y sociales. En los adultos mayores pueden producirse cambios en el sistema inhibitorio descendente que lleven a una capacidad disminuida del organismo para responder al estres del dolor persistente. Su tratamiento requiere de un cuidadoso manejo farmacologico, debido a los cambios fisiologicos del envejecimiento y a las posibles interacciones, sin olvidar la importancia del tratamiento no farmacologico. El mantenimiento de la calidad de vida y de la funcion son los principales objetivos del tratamiento del dolor. \nLa fragilidad es otra situacion que impacta directamente sobre la calidad de vida y el mantenimiento de la independencia de la persona mayor. Es un estado en el que existe un descenso de las reservas funcionales que llevan a un estado de vulnerabilidad con riesgo de desenlaces adversos. Existen multiples factores que caracterizan la fragilidad de una persona mayor, entre ellos uno de los mas relevantes es la sarcopenia, definida como una perdida de masa y fuerza muscular. La evaluacion de la fragilidad requiere de cuestionarios que evaluen la situacion fisica, nutricional y funcional del anciano. Debido a sus consecuencias, las principales son el desarrollo de discapacidad y dependencia y el aumento del riesgo de caidas, se requiere un manejo cuidadoso, con especial vigilancia a la alimentacion, actividad fisica, deterioro funcional y funcion cognitiva para la prevencion y el tratamiento de la fragilidad. \nLa realizacion de actividad fisica ha sido identificada como un tratamiento eficaz para revertir y prevenir la fragilidad. Ademas de reportar beneficios para los pacientes con dolor cronico y con otras patologias cardiovasculares o metabolicas. No realizar actividad fisica de forma habitual podria incrementar el riesgo de caidas, el desarrollo de discapacidad y el aislamiento social. La realizacion de programas de actividad fisica multicomponente son las principales intervenciones para el manejo de fragilidad, y tambien han demostrado beneficioso para personas con dolor cronico. \nObjetivos Analizar la relacion entre el dolor cronico y la situacion de fragilidad y evaluar la efectividad de una intervencion educativa estructurada de ejercicio fisico multicomponente en personas mayores pre-fragiles con dolor cronico en Atencion Primaria de Salud. \nMetodologia Para responder a los objetivos se han realizado tres estudios con diferentes metodologias: Estudio 1: Se ha realizado una revision sistematica sobre estudios cuantitativos realizados en adultos mayores de 60 anos que residen en la comunidad y que recogen como resultado el dolor cronico no oncologico. La busqueda se realizo en las siguientes bases de datos. Pubmed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library Plus, Scielo, LILACS y JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports con el fin de identificar la evidencia descrita en la literatura cientifica sobre la prevalencia del dolor en adultos mayores fragiles y si el dolor cronico es un predictor de la fragilidad. \nEstudio 2: Se realizo un estudio observacional transversal descriptivo en Atencion Primaria sobre personas con edad ≥ 65 anos y dolor cronico no oncologico de mas de 3 meses de evolucion que fueran independientes y no se encontraran institucionalizados. Se evaluo su nivel de fragilidad mediante el cuestionario de fragilidad para Atencion Primaria SHARE-FI y la relacion del nivel de fragilidad con otras variables como intensidad del dolor, edad, sexo, frecuentacion a las consultas del centro de salud, farmacos prescritos y comorbilidades. \nEstudio 3: Se realizo un Ensayo Clinico Aleatorizado con los pacientes identificados como pre-fragiles en el estudio observacional transversal anterior. Se analizo el impacto de participar en un programa de educacion para la salud basado en un programa de actividad fisica multicomponente comparado con la practica habitual en la calidad de vida, intensidad del dolor, funcion fisica y depresion de los participantes. \nResultados Estudio 1: La revision sistematica de la literatura muestra que el dolor cronico es mas frecuente entre las personas fragiles, con una prevalencia de fragilidad entre los pacientes con dolor cronico en torno al 45% que puede llegar a mas del 70%. Ademas, el dolor cronico actua como predictor de la fragilidad y las personas que sufren dolor de mayor intensidad o interferencia muestran peores niveles de fragilidad. \nEstudio 2: Entre los pacientes mayores con dolor cronico identificados, el 20,1% son fragiles, el 38,3 pre-fragiles y el 41,6% no fragiles. La intensidad de dolor es forma estadisticamente significativa superior entre los pacientes fragiles respecto a los pre-fragiles y entre los pre-fragiles respecto a los no fragiles (p=0). La Odds Ratio (OR) para ser clasificado como fragil o pre-fragil teniendo un dolor de moderada o elevada intensidad fue 4,21 (95% IC = 2,11-8,40). La edad ≥ 75 anos (OR: 3,41 95% IC = 1,74-6,68) y el sexo femenino (OR: 4,62 95% IC = 2,23-9,59) tambien se relacionaron con ser clasificado como fragil o pre-fragil. Ademas la frecuentacion a consultas medicas y de enfermeria fue mucho mayor en los pacientes fragiles y pre-fragiles que en los no fragiles. \nEstudio 3: Se reclutaron 32 participantes pre-fragiles con dolor cronico (17 en el grupo intervencion y 15 en el grupo control). Los participantes que recibieron una intervencion de actividad fisica multicomponente mostraron mejoras en la calidad de vida respecto al grupo control medida mediante el indice de utilidades del cuestionario EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) tras la intervencion, diferencia de medias= -0,19 (95%IC = -0,33- -0,04; p=,02) y tras tres meses de seguimiento, diferencia de medias= -0,21 (95%IC =-0,37- -0,05; p=,01). Tambien se encontraron mejoras estadisticamente significativas intra grupo en el grupo intervencion en la funcion fisica medida con el Short Physical Performance Battery (p=,01), la Escala Visual Analogica del cuestionario EQ-5D (p=,04) y la intensidad del dolor medida con una Escala Visual Analogica (p=0). \nConclusiones La fragilidad es un problema de salud frecuente en personas que sufren dolor cronico. Tambien es mas frecuente en mujeres y personas de mayor edad. Presentar dolor de mayor intensidad se relaciona con peores niveles de fragilidad. Una intervencion de ejercicio fisico multicomponente puede ser beneficiosa para mejorar la calidad de vida de personas pre-fragiles con dolor cronico asi como su funcion fisica y las personas que la reciben muestran una elevada satisfaccion con ella.",

      "title": "Alcohol use, Abuse, Depression and Anxiety : The Clinical Links",
      "abstract": "Alcohol dependence, anxiety disorders and major depression commonly occur together; however, few stud- ies have assessed prospectively the magnitude of the risk that one disorder imparts on the subsequent oc- currence of the other. The following articles looks at certain important clinical factors in this association while trying to point out the reasons for the linkage between these disorders and how their treatments and management are interdependent. It also looks at comorbidity studies and outcome factors based on management. INTRODUCTION The recent large-scale epidemiologic study of psychopathol- ogy in the United States indicates that, while nearly half of the population will experience a major psychiatric illness at some point over their lifetime, the majority of these individu- als will also meet diagnostic criteria for at least one addi- tional disorder. In addition to its high frequency, psychiatric comorbidity has been shown to have important implications for patient functioning and prognosis. Comorbid conditions typically follow a more chronic and severe course than single disorders, and they are less amenable to treatment. Individu- als with two or more diagnoses are also significantly more likely to experience severe impairment in important life do- mains such as social and occupational functioning. For these reasons, it is not surprising that comorbidity has been re- ferred to as one of the most important challenges in the field of mental health. Understanding the nature of these relation- ships may have important implications for improving nosol- ogy, as well as for developing better models of prevention and treatment. Although many psychiatric disorders co-occur with great frequency, few conditions have been more widely or consistently implicated in comorbid relationships than alcoholism. Alcoholism is perhaps most strongly associated with antisocial personality disorder and drug abuse, but its relationship to other forms of psychopathology has become increasingly evident. In particular, investigations of patient samples indicate a strong co-occurrence of alcoholism with diverse forms of anxiety and depressive disorders. Results from community surveys and epidemiologic samples indicate that substantial comorbidity also exists for these disorders in the general population. These latter findings are particu- larly meaningful considering that alcoholism, anxiety, and depressive disorders are also the most common psychiatric syndromes in community surveys. The high co-occurrence of these syndromes, therefore, represents a significant clinical and public health issue that is likely to affect a substantial proportion of the general population.",

      "title": "Treatment options for situational anxiety in the neurology physician practice",
      "abstract": "Recent decades have been characterized by high stress levels, which inevitably leads to neuroticism and psychopathization of the population. Emotional stress and the anxiety that follows it can be the cause and provocateur of some pathological processes and diseases. Unlike normal anxiety, intended to adapt the body, protect it and preserve life, pathological anxiety is inadequate to the intensity of the threat, is long-lasting, severe, and disrupts the quality of a person’s life and his activities. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis caused by stress leads to the development of psycho-vegetative syndrome – a complex of somatic, vegetative, and mental symptoms. However, in clinical practice, doctors usually encounter the fact that the patient more often presents various multisystem somatic complaints, ignoring emotional experiences. Undiagnosed anxiety can lead to chronicity or relapse of the disease, the prescription of only symptomatic therapy and aggravation of the course of the missed anxiety disorder. For a doctor to qualitatively assess the clinical picture, it is necessary to understand the structure of autonomic dysfunction in various systems and “recognize” the manifestations of anxiety. Managing such patients, especially comorbid ones, is a complex task, the solution of which will be most effective through joint efforts with psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, art therapy, music therapy, medications are an integral part of the therapy for this category of patients. Psychotropic drugs can reduce both anxiety and vegetative symptoms. For subclinical anxiety disorder with somatic manifestations, herbal sedatives or drugs based on them are used in outpatient practice, which have a favorable safety profile with sufficient effectiveness. The drug of choice may be Valocordin, which has sedative, antispasmodic, and hypnotic effects, which corresponds to the goals of treating psychovegetative syndrome.",

Others describe the psychosocial factors as stressors themselves (4). However, all agree that they are important in managing cardiovascular disease because they contribute to both the pathogenesis of heart disease and its aggravation by mechanisms independent from those of traditional risk factors (2).

The clinical symptoms of these disturbances are as follows: The blood pressure becomes higher on a constant level, and at the same time one finds various signs of cardiac incompetence, especially during physical work, such as increase in the pulse rate, precordial uneasiness and, sometimes, dizziness. The accommodative power of the blood pressure becomes unsteady, as demonstrated by its irregular fluctuation. Therefore, an investigation into the complicated mechanism of the origin of high blood pressure in persons of presenile age is justified.

Patients and family caregivers frequently experience anxiety which is specific to each of the following phases of cancer trajectory: upon diagnosis, during cancer treatments, during survivorship, upon and after cancer recurrence, and end-of-life period. Approximately a third of patients develop depression, including major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder. Inclusive criteria, which includes somatic symptoms regardless of whether or not they come from physical causes, is recommended as the diagnostic criteria of major depressive disorder in cancer patients. Both psychotherapies (e.g. supportive psychotherapy, problem-solving therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy) and pharmacological treatments are effective for major depressive disorder in cancer patients. Psychological distress of family caregivers has been reported as high as or even higher than that of patients themselves. Psychosocial interventions targeted to patients and family caregivers jointly can enhance caregivers’ coping resources, increase self-efficacy, thereby, reduce their burden and anxiety.",

      "abstract": "The development of psychotropic chemotherapy with widespread use in the psychiatric clinic for its anxiolytic, hypnotic, antidepressant, psychostimulant or psycho-destructive sedative effects has given rise to a new pathology secondary to increased abuse and accessibility. Their neurotropism is generally exerted on the central nervous system at the level of the complex meso-diencephalo-striate structures, influencing the elementary psychic functions, but also the activity of the whole organism through the neuro-humoral system. The clinical investigation of the patient must be interdisciplinary in nature, as human beings are characterized by a bio-psycho-social unit, in which the various biological and psychological components, influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the social environment, are involved in a special way, which gives an original personality to everyone. There are five fundamental axes, which are usually evaluated: thinking, memory, attention, emotion and behavior. A disorder in any of these axes, intense enough to interrupt the normal activity in more than one operating field over a sufficiently long period of time, is diagnosable as a mental disorder. There is an indication borrowed from internal medicine regarding the acute character (weeks), subacute character (months) and chronic character (years), which is attached to the diagnosis. A small part of the entire psychiatric population suffers from severe conditions, which involve intermittent episodes of severe disinhibition, aggressive behavior and self- or hetero-directed violence. In most cases, we talk about conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders (panic disorder, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder), which do not make him a social predator, although they cause enormous suffering to the individual. This study includes 67 patients with mental illness. While conducting the study, we took into account that the first contact with the patient is essential for the results of the anamnesis, oral examination, risk assessment and provisional treatment plan. In the 67 cases there were performed mycological analyses. It is necessary that dentists have certain knowledge of psychology and psychopathology, in order to understand the mechanism of psychopathological reactions and avoid them.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder (PD)",
      "abstract": "Participants of expert group on CPG for Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder S.C Tiwari, Nilesh Shah, I.D. Gupta, B.N. Gangadhar, Devendra Vijay Vergiya, Pratap Sharan INTRODUCTION Short description of anxiety disorders Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Definition: One of the anxiety disorders, where the primary symptoms of anxiety are present at most days for at least several weeks at a time, and usually for several months. The symptoms should usually involve elements of: Apprehension (worries about future misfortunes, feeling \" on edge\", etc) Motor tension (restlessness, inability to relax, trembling) Autonomic over activity (light-headedness, sweating, tachycardia, tachypnea, dry mouth etc) The transient appearance of depressive symptoms, does not rule out the diagnosis of GAD as main diagnosis. The sufferer must not meet the full criteria for depressive episode, phobic disorder, panic disorder or OCD. Patients with generalised anxiety disorder have high anxiety and are worried about intrapsychic conflicts or external environmental events. They have multiple somatic symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, difficulty in concentration, irritability, fatigue, muscular tensions and difficulty in sleeping particularly early insomnia. They have vague apprehension about future events and fear of unknown. Common features observed in anxiety disorders include: Panic Disorder- Episodes of intense fear or discomfort accompanied by severe autonomic activity, palpitations, sweating, dyspnoea, chocking sensation or other somatic symptoms like chest pain, trembling, nausea, discomfort or fluttering sensation in abdomen and impending fear of death. Patient perceives it as a serious medical condition and invariably reaches to a medical emergency setup where after thorough physical evaluation he is declared normal. Phobias- Many patients with GAD suffer from irrational, unrealistic fears and acute autonomic reactions to certain specific situations or extreme fear to certan inanimate objects. They include agarophobia (fear of open spaces) fear of crowds, being out side home alone or traveling in a bus train or car. Some may have fear in closed spaces (claustrophobia) fear of heights (acrophobia) fear of opposite sex (hetero-phobia) fear of sight of blood (erythrophobia) or fear of facing certain social situations (social anxiety disorder) the common feature among all phobias being intense fear, increased autonomic activity and avoidance behavior (avoiding the fearful object or situation). Obsessive compulsive disorder- (OCD) has been seperately dealt with in details in these guidelines however the patients suffering from OCD have recurrent repetitive unwanted intrinsic thoughts (obsessions) or actions (compulsions) or both which lead to extreme distress, loss of time and impairment of functioning of the individual. The obsessious include douts, ideas of contamination, sexual thoughts or religious preoccupations or negative thoughts towards gods/goddess, the compulsions include activities like counting, checking, repeating, washing hoarding and touching objects, some have to and fro movements of body parts. Patient is aware of the irrationality of thoughts/actions but cannot control them, which produces intense anxiety and autonomic arousal with feelings of helplessness and guilt. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - Usually it occurs after a terrifying event that involving physical or psychological traumatic event. It may also occure because of witnessing or experiencing a serious harm to other significant persons in life. Patients have terrifying recollections of the event, or nightmares. Some patients have an experience of living the event in an illusionary or imaginary situation with hallucinations, or flashback episodes. The patients suffer from intense psychological or physical distress. Many patients develop loss of interest, estrangement from others, sleep disturbances, irritability, difficulty concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response. This phenomenon may persist for one month or more before it is diagnosed. Natural history and course The age of onset is difficult to specify, as most of the patients have been anxious for long but report late. Nearly 1/3rd of the patients who have GAD seek psychiatric treatment. Many go to GPs, physicians, cardiologist, chest specialist for the somatic component of the disorder. Because of the high incidence of co-morbid mental disorders, the course and prognosis is difficult to predict. The occurrence of several negative life events greatly increases the likelihood that the disorder will develop. In all, a chronic condition may be life long. COMMON INGREDIENTS OF MANAGEMENT PLAN (FLOW CHART-1 AND 2)FLOW CHART 1. Management of Generalized Anxiety DisorderFLOW CHART 2. Management of Panic DisorderThe aim of management is to provide relief in psychological and somatic symptoms and minimize the impairment. This can be addressed in following ways. 1. Pharmacotherapy The drug treatment of GAD is some times required as long as 6-12 month treatment, some evidence indicate that treatment should be long term. 2. Psychotherapy Cognitive behaviour therapy Behavioural techniques Supportive Psychotherapy Insight oriented Psychotherapy Goals Psycho-education Direct explanation of the symptoms and disorder to the patient and the family. Monitoring of anxiety Cognitive restructuring: Corrects the hypothesized cognitive distortions and helps to identify and counter fear of bodily sensations. Efficacy Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has proven efficy other psychotherapies do help in ameliorating symptoms of anxiety. It addresses cognitive distortions and somatic symptoms. More effective with chronically anxious patients, may need 8-10 sessions. It has been shown that yogic techniques produced greater motivation to practice than progressive relaxation Meditation was found to be as effective as pharmacotherapy in controlling symptoms of anxiety. The overall efficacy claims are backed by very few Indian studies, but are useful. It requires considerable time and discipline from the patients. Adverse effects These are relatively benign. Some patients may develop dependence on the therapist and that needs cautious vigil. 3. Combined pharmacological and psychotherapeutic intervention Long-term outcome is better when they are used in combination. ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION 1. Performing a diagnostic evaluation Psychiatric evaluation and physical examination is necessary. It includes history of present illness, current symptoms; past psychiatric history, general medical history and history of substance use, personal history (eg. psychological development, life events and response to those events), social, occupational and family history; review of the patient's medications; physical and mental status examination and adequate diagnostic tool and criteria. Diagnose GAD according to ICD-10 (W.H.0,1992). Anxiety should not be due to the other Axis I disorder (eg. mood disorder, psychotic disorder, social phobia, OCD, somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, PTSD) or a general medical condition (eg. hyperthyroidism) or substance use disorder (intoxication or withdrawal), (see appendix-1 for flow chart). 2. Evaluating particular symptoms Patients experience excessive anxiety but many of them experience panic attacks, which may worsen the clinical picture. The prolonged illness may cause depressive symptoms with emergence of suicidality and substance abuse. 3. Evaluating severity of functional impairment Many may continue to function in their social and occupational lives with some impairment, others may become severely incapacitated and give up their jobs and social duties. The impairment in different areas can be assessed self-administered visual analog scale. FORMULATING TREATMENTS AND CHOICE OF TREATMENT SETTINGS The aim of management is to provide relief in psychological and somatic symptoms and minimize the impairment. This can be addressed in following way. 1. Establishing and maintaining atherapeutic alliance The treatment of GAD may be long lasting hence the alliance is crucial. Understanding the life events, the extent and severity of symptoms requires confiding and lasting therapeutic relationship. Attention to the patient's worries and fears are essential for long term gains 2. Monitoringthe patient's psychiatric status The symptomatic improvement in psychological and autonomic symptoms leads to greater confidence in the treating doctor. The anxiety goes slowly with treatment and bursts of severe symptoms during the treatment need constant monitoring. 3. Pharmacotherapy The drug treatment of GAD is some times is seen as a 6-12 month treatment, some evidence indicate that treatment should be long term. a). Goals Reduce psychological and autonomic symptoms and other co morbid conditions. Improve occupational and social functioning. b). Efficacy Little Indian data to address the issue; mainly western data available. c). Adverse effects Different for different class of drugs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and pregabalin are recommended as first line drugs due to their favorable risk-benefit ratio, with some differentiation regarding the various anxiety disorders. The common category of pharmacological agents used in management of generialised anxiety disorders include SSRIs, SNRIs, Pregabalin, TCAs, Benzodiazepines, Antihistamines, Atypical antipsychotics, and Antioxidants. Role of vitamin A, C and E has been evaluated and recommended in adequate doses for patients suffering from GAD. Dosing Majority of patients respond to the low dose of antidepressants (with the exception of OCD). In the elderly, treatment should be started with half the recommended dose or less in order to minimize initial adverse drug events. The antidepressant dose should be increased to the highest recommended therapeutic level if the initial treatment with a low or medium dose fails. For patients who do not improve with standard treatments, a number of alternative options should be tried including augmentation with small dose of antipsychotics or adding another anxiolytic agent or addition of non-pharmacological therapy like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or Yoga, Meditation and increased physical activity as described below. 4. Non-pharmacological treatment Non pharmacological treatment found useful in treatment of anxiety disorders include supportive therapy, Exposure therapy (e.g. gradual exposure in vivo, \"flooding\") and response prevention. Psychoeducational advice, and suggesions to not to avoid feared situations are helpful in management. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Adequate strength of evidence is available for Individual CBT, Group CBT and Self-directed CBT. Choosing between medications and CBT is determined by a number of factors, particularly the patient's preference, treatment options at hand, adverse drug effects, onset of efficacy, comorbidity (e.g. with depression), financial considerations, time availability, accessibility of psychiatric and psychological treatment resources, and experience of the clinician. Steps of CBT shall include: Psychoeducation Self-monitoring Systemic exposure to panic inducing cues Countering anxious beliefs Exposure to fear cues Modify [mal-adaptive behaviors Relapse prevention Dealing with transference issues Resolving interpersonal and other emotional issues. Initial expectations and anticipation favoring CBT Accept that the worrying is out of control Perhaps, worrying offers some protective value. CBT will facilitate future adversities, despite the worrying. During the course of the treatment, revised understanding: The reasons for worrying and fears cannot be controlled Subjectively learn to control response to the fears and worries Learn to obviate the behaviour of worrying Worrying does not have a protective value Actually, worrying reinforces negative thinking Excesive worrying increases likely hood or more anxieties in the future CBT does not alter the method of managing source of the worries CBT helps to be better equipped to handle the future stress. Indian modules of psychotherapy Several therapists have talked about Search of Indian module of psychotherapy and it is a felt need to have such a module, which is socially and culturally relevant. Ancient Indian thought has provided very rich knowledge regarding mind and its functioning. From the Vedic period issues relating to mind, consciousness, understanding of human life, its existence and the concept of Atman have been widely studied and several explanations to improve the quality of human life are available in Vedic and Post Vedic literature. The Bhagvad Gita contains in condensed form all the philosophical and psycholoical wisdom of the Upanishads. Bhagwad Gita describes all aspects of yoga, psychology and is unique among the psychlogical and philosophical teachings for a student of psychotherapy, various aspects of psychotherapeutic techniques are described in it. In this excellent module of Psychotherapy through 18 chapters way of self knowledge, the Yoga of action (karma) knowledge of renunciation and action, the path of meditation, knowledge of the absolute and eternal, yogic vision, yoga of devotion, profound knowledge of three Gunas and the wisdom of renunciation and liberation have been described at length, which leads to personality transformation of Arjuna. In the modern psychotherapy, cognitive restructuring is the goal of psychotherapy, which has been accomplished a great deal through Bhagwad Gita. Prekshadhayan A Jain Meditational technique propounded by Acharya Mahapragya, which includes relaxation, meditation, yoga, asanas and pranayam, a comprehensive capsule of behavioural management has been tried in management of GAD. On mental level, it proves to be an applied method to train the mind to concentrate. It offers a way to treat serious anxiety disorders with or without drugs. Large trials of this technique are still awaited. At present, few scientific studies are available. 5. Providing Education To The Patient And Family This seemingly unimportant aspect is most relevant to Indian settings where awareness of psychiatric illness and its realization and need for treatment with compliance is little. Many feel dejected, angry, isolated and may have suicidal ideas. Family and the patient need to be told that this is like any other illness that needs treatment and success depends on compliance. 6. Addressing early signs of relapse The education that the illness is a chronic relapsing illness is essential and emergence of anxiety with or without treatment should be promptly treated. Sudden discontinuation may lead to emergence of withdrawal symptoms thus early recognition by the patient and the family helps in prompt treatment. MANAGEMENT AS PER THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE ILLNESS The treatment recommendations for the different anxiety disorders are summarized in Table I. Some antianxiety drugs are effective in all anxiety disorders, whereas some drugs have only been studied in specific anxiety disorders and thus should be reserved for use in these particular disorders. Panic disorder and agoraphobia. In acute panic attacks, mouth desolving short-acting benzodiazepines and reassurance to the patient may be sufficient. SSRIs SNRIs are first-line treatments for longterm management. Patients should be treated for atleast six to eight months or longer to prevent relapses. A combination of CBT and anxiolytic medication has been shown to have the best treatment outcomes. In GAD and Social anxiety disorder (SAD): Choice of Drugs for Management are SSRIs, SNRIs and pregabalin. Buspirone and hydroxyzine are second line treatment. Benzodiazepines should only be used for long-term treatment when other drugs or CBT have not shown results. Specific phobia: Specific phobia should be treated with behaviour therapy including systematic desensatisation. SSRIs or short acting benzodiazepines should be tried in cases not responding to behaviour therapy. OCD: Choice of treatments is the SSRIs and the TCA clomipramine. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention are other proven techniques of management. PTSD: Choice of treatments includes the SSRIs and venlafaxine. Therapeutic conversation, psychoeducation and regrief therapy are non-pharmacological treatment techniques advocated. TREATMENT UNDER SPECIAL CONDITIONS (FLOW CHART-3)FLOW CHART 3. Management of Anxiety Disorders in Special PopulationPregnancy. The use of SSRIs and TCAs in pregnancy does not have increased risk for malformations. It is recommended to avoid paroxetine alprazolam use among pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant. Breast-feeding. SSRIs and TCAs are excreted into breast milk, they do not cause any harm to the new born because the concentration in breast milk is very small however infants of mothers on benzodiazepines, should be observed for signs of sedation, lethargy, poor suckling, and weight loss, and if high doses have to be used and long-term administration is required, breast feeding should probably be discontinued. Treating children and adolescents. Choice of treatment should be SSRIs concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior have ben reported therefore careful monitoring is advisable, presence of comorbid depression should be looked fore. Treating the elderly. Elderly have increased sensitivity for anticholinergic properties, an increased risk for orthostatic hypotension, and ECG changes during treatment with TCAs, and possible paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines, which include depression, with or without suicidal tendencies, phobias, aggressiveness, or violent behavior. Thus, treatment with TCAs or benzodiazepines is less favorable, while SSRIs appear to be safe. Treatment of patients with severe Physical disease. Patients with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and endocrine disease, irritable bowel syndrome, malignency, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hyperthyroidism may have associated anxiety reactions with their somatic disease state. Such anxiety disorders may compound the management and the prognosis of these primary conditions. Advocated pharmacological agents in such conditions include SSRIs and Venlafaxine. WHEN TO STOP TREATMENT Decesion to stop treatment will depend on clinical response of the patients. Usualy the treatment is stopped in a tapering manner after atleast 6 months stability of clinical improvement and asymptomatic status of the patient. Before stopping the treatment, the nature of illness possibilities of recurrence, response to triggers and his/her ability to cope with the situation should be discussed at length. Patient's personal view should be included in decesion making of stopping the treatment. Patient should be encouraged to adapt alternative methods of anxiety reduction like yoga, pranayam, relaxation techniques including progressive muscular relaxation (PMR)/Shavasan etc. which can be mastered by him before weaning off the smallest dose of antianxiety medication. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (MBCBT) for reducing cognitive and somatic anxiety and modifying dysfunctional cognitions in patients with anxiety disorders has been tried where in different versions of mindfulness meditation, cognitive restructuring, and strategies to handle worry, such as, worry postponement, worry exposure, and problem solving have been employed. However, these studies are on small number of patients and need carefull review for further application. MANAGEMENT OF SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATION Diffrent side effects will emerge with different category of antianxiety medication. They should be carefully observed and addressed to. Side effects of medication can be drug related or dose related. If it is drug, related, alternative class of drug should be tried for adequate length of time. If it is dose related then the dose of the drug has to be reduced. Things to remember for GAD: Anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects to be kept in mind when using tricyclic and Tetra cyclic for side effects. Precaution in suicidal patients. Long-term treatment may be required. Psychopharmacological therapy combined with psychotherapy works better.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The ability to monitor the electrocardiogram (ECG) during daily life, together with refinements in self-monitoring diary techniques have increased scientific understanding of the effects of physical and mental stress on the heart. During daily life, myocardial ischemia—an important functional measure of the activity of coronary disease—occurs frequently in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients during a wide variety of activities and exhibits characteristic features: it is more frequently asymptomatic or silent; it is triggered at relatively low heart rate elevations compared to controlled exercise testing; and it exhibits a circa-dian rhythm, being more likely in the morning. This article reviews recent ambulatory monitoring studies employing structured diaries, suggesting that behavioral factors, including mental stress, may contribute to these features of out-of-hospital ischemia. Mental stress is shown to be a potent trigger of daily-life ischemia, and silent versus symptomatic episodes have a different profile of physical and mental triggers. Daily activity cycles also appear to contribute to the morning increase in ischemia. Methodological issues in ambulatory ECG/diary studies are considered, especially concerning the reliability and validity of diary reports and problems associated with the analysis of data involving many repeated observations on large numbers of subjects.",

      "title": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, encompasses fear and avoidance of social or performance situations, with prominent fear of embarrassment or humiliation (see Box 18–1 for the DSM-5 criteria). The disorder is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of 12% (Ruscio et al. 2008). It typically has onset by teenage years and is often chronic. The scope of feared situations can range from fear of a few specific public performance situations to a more generalized fear of most social situations. In this chapter we review the psychosocial and medication approaches with the strongest evidence base for efficacy in the treatment of SAD. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 300.23 F40.10 Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive. Specify if: Performance only: If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public.",

      "abstract": "The psychiatry of childhood differs from the psychiatry of adulthood in several important particulars. Although one cannot safely assume that the mind of the new-born infant is entirely a blank, from the conventional point of view it is nearly that, whereas the mind of the adult has been exposed to the influence of convention throughout childhood and hence is bound to be biased. Perhaps the other reasons for the differences between these two aspects of psychiatry depend on this fundamental fact. However, there are mechanisms whereby these differences express themselves. One important point of view is associated with and dependent on the rate at which a child constantly learns. Such a process, of course, means constant change. This is particularly important when one realizes how severe man is toward his mistakes. A person can be right many times and have no particular emotional reaction therefrom, but if he is wrong",

      "title": "Overview of Psychiatric Symptoms and Syndromes",
      "abstract": "This chapter provides an overview of psychiatric symptoms and syndromes that can be seen with neurologic diseases. Our goal is not to discuss every psychiatric disorder that might occur but to focus on those that are the most common. Important characteristics of this condition include: • Intermittently sad mood • Identifiable precipitant • Absence of major depression Just as grief is a normal response to loss, demoralization is a normal response to adversity. When bad things happen, our spirits fall. Because adversity is common with neurologic diseases, so is demoralization. Thus, patients may become demoralized when they learn they have a neurologic disease (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease), when they experience the symptoms of such a disease (eg, blindness, aphasia, pain), or when they develop the side effects of treatment for the disease (eg, weight gain from prednisone, dyskinesias from levodopa). Demoralization is not linked to any particular group of neurologic diseases, but it tends to be more common in those that are chronic, progressive, painful, debilitating, or disfiguring. Demoralized patients are almost always sad, but they may also be frustrated, irritable, pessimistic, or anxious. These unpleasant emotions are directly related to the patient’s situation and diminish as that situation improves. Someone who is demoralized by pain cheers up when the pain is relieved. Even when patients are demoralized by circumstances that cannot be reversed, their mood often improves when they discover that they are not powerless in the face of adversity. In this way, patients who become demoralized when they are told that they have a terminal illness may feel better as they start to focus on what they can do with the time left to them, and patients who become demoralized by the onset of a paraplegia may brighten as they begin to make progress in rehabilitation. This direct relationship between the patient’s mood and his or her situation helps distinguish the sadness of demoralization from that of major depression, because in the latter condition the patient’s mood remains low despite improving circumstances. Other features of a demoralized state also help differentiate demoralization from major depression.",

It hopes to shed some light on the following questions: Do different people report different types of pain or do different symptoms co-occur in the same individuals? What are the characteristics of people with multiple pains? Are different symptoms all expressions of the same syndrome, or do they represent separate entities? What are the possibilities for preventing the onset of chronic pain, or its long-term consequences in daily life? The chapter shows that pain, especially multiple pains, are very common in the population. The perception, impact, and prognosis of pain varies widely between individuals and across different groups of people, and seems to depend on a variety of factors. Some of these factors are specific to the type of pain (e.g., age and gender), but most are generically important across different types of pain, and include an individual's history of pain, presence of multiple pains or other physical symptoms, and several psychological and social factors.",

Although hormetic influences are clearly encountered at the cellular and molecular level, little is known about the effects of hormesis at a clinical level. This paper examines the suggestion that mild stimulation or appropriately timed challenges may be used clinically in order to influence the impact of age-related disease and dysfunction. Examples of stimulation or challenges that may exhibit hormetic effects include dietary restriction, physical and mental exercise, and even social and spiritual stimulation. Dietary restriction places the organism under nutritional stress, stimulating several biochemical repair pathways that may counteract certain age-related changes. Physical and mental challenges, if appropriately timed and sufficiently varied, are directed at increasing the complexity and integration of interacting muscular, cardiovascular, and neural stimuli. Social and spiritual stimulation aimed at reversing age-related loss of dynamical complexity acts upon even higher levels to ensure a reduced risk of social problems in aging.",

Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, respiratory disorders, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders seem to be associated with mental disorders; the rates of occurrence, however, depend on the special characteristics of the sample. Utilization of healthcare systems and costs for patients with mental-somatic comorbidities are suggested to be higher than those for patients without comorbidities.Although it is generally accepted that many physical conditions have been associated with serious mental disorders, the exact nature of the relationship between them is still unclear.

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

      "abstract": "espanolEl aumento de la esperanza de vida ha generado un creciente interes por el estudio de la calidad de vida de las personas mayores. La depresion y la ansiedad son los dos problemas de salud mental mas frecuentes en este grupo de pacientes y con mayor repercusion en su calidad de vida. La depresion comporta habitualmente una serie de conductas (mala alimentacion, aislamiento, sedentarismo, desinteres por la higiene y atencion de un mismo, etc.) que pueden precipitar o agravar otras enfermedades fisicas. Por otro lado, el riesgo de aparicion de depresion en edades avanzadas puede aumentar ante la frecuente restriccion de actividades y el aislamiento social, los impedimentos en la movilidad, asi como por el impacto creciente de enfermedades medicas, sobre todo de origen cardiovascular, vascular-cerebrales y neurodegenerativas. Existe, por lo tanto, una relacion de causalidad bidireccional entre la salud fisica y la mental. Parece que la ciencia esta demostrando lo que propuso hace muchos siglos Juvenal en la famosa expresion «Mens sana in corpore sano». Es logico, de acuerdo con lo expuesto anteriormente, que intervenciones basadas en el estilo de vida esten demostrando utilidad en la prevencion y el tratamiento de los trastornos mentales. Por ejemplo, la practica regular de ejercicio fisico, una dieta sana y equilibrada como la que ofrece el patron mediterraneo, una correcta higiene de sueno y la exposicion moderada a la luz solar pueden ser herramientas importantes en el abordaje de los sintomas depresivos en la poblacion mayor, ademas de mejorar su salud fisica. catalaL’augment de l’esperanca de vida ha generat un creixent interes per l’estudi de la qualitat de vida de les persones grans.

      "abstract": "Every physician faces the problem of dealing with mental symptoms in his patients. Mental symptoms are of very frequent occurrence. They may arise in the course of any disease process. Not infrequently cases appear in which a morbid mental state constitutes the essential etiologic soil out of which the somatic, or bodily, symptoms arise. On the other hand, organic disease is constantly giving rise to emotional or mental reactions. On whichever basis they may arise, much of the mental symptomatology commonly encountered can be interpreted by the general medical practitioner. The general physician often hesitates to deal with mental conditions, although he attacks with confidence problems of equally obscure organic, serologic or bacterial origin. For example, the clinician makes use of the technical researches of the specialist in cardiorenal disorders, or of the biochemist in diabetes, or of the endocrinologist in the use of complicated ductless gland therapy.

      "title": "Pain, stress, and anxiety : Interrelationships and treatment necessities",
      "abstract": "Anxiety is a natural reaction to stress, but in some individuals it can develop into a psychopathological condition that persists even after the stress has been resolved. The number of and amount of difficulty associated with stressful life events can be a significant predictor for the development of depression or anxiety-related disorders. Individuals suffering from anxiety disorders are more likely to report exposure to stressful events than nonanxious individuals. These relationships are even stronger when anxiety and major depression are comorbid within individuals. In addition, anxiety and depression are prominent in many patients with pain disorders. The presence of pain can be seen not only as a possible marker for anxiety, but also as a causative factor. In either of these cases, the presence of persistent painful symptoms should be a strong indication to clinicians that an anxiety disorder may develop or may already be present, and that treatment is needed for both the pain symptoms and the comorbid anxiety. With daily life becoming increasingly more stressful, the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety spectrum disorders become more important. Treating these disorders early can prevent generalized anxiety from developing into more disabling disorders. This monograph reviews the relationship between stressful life events and anxiety as well as comorbidity of pain and anxiety, and examines the somatic symptoms, such as muscle aches, chest pain, and headaches, often associated with anxiety disorders. Available treatments that may be efficacious in the treatment of individuals experiencing comorbid anxiety and pain are discussed as well.",

Menopozla ilişkili semptomların ana nedeninin kadınlarda östrojen düzeylerindeki kayıptan kaynaklandığına dair kanıtlar vardır. Menopoz genellikle sıcak basması, idrar bozuklukları, eklem ağrısı ve psikolojik sıkıntı gibi çeşitli sağlık şikayetleriyle ilişkilidir. Menopoz semptomlarını bildiren kadınların genel sağlık durumu genellikle daha kötüdür. Menopoz sırasında ve sonrasında birçok kadında depresyon (mutsuzluk, sinirlilik, ağlamaklılık, enerji eksikliği) veya anksiyete (ruh hali değişiklikleri, uykusuzluk, kalp çarpıntısı, panik atak, unutkanlık veya odaklanma ve konsantrasyon sorunları) belirtileri görülmektedir. Egzersiz, bilinen az sayıda yan etkisi ile uygun maliyetli bir alternatif yöntem olup, egzersizin menopoz semptomları, depresyon ve yaşam kalitesi üzerinde olumlu etkisi olduğu da gösterilmiştir. Ayrıca egzersizin kemik, kardiyovasküler, metabolik, diyabet, kanser, uzun ömür, psikolojik sağlık ve genel yaşam kalitesi üzerinde pek çok faydasının olduğu açıktır. Bu nedenle kadınların menopoza geçiş dönemi ve sonrasında fiziksel olarak aktif olması uygundur. Sonuç olarak sağlık profesyonellerinin kadın yaşamında önemli bir yere sahip olan menopoz ve sonrası dönemde kadın sağlığını korumak ve yükseltmek için kadınların egzersiz yapmalarına teşvik edilmesi ve farkındalık oluşturulması önemlidir.",

ED may induce depression, loss of self-esteem, poor self-image, anxiety, and tension in the relationship with the partner. These emotional disturbances can create physical conditions that lead to increased difficulty in achieving an erection. Depression can deprive a person of the ability to experience many of life's pleasures. It not only affects the mind but also the body--often in unexpected ways. As a result, many men who have been diagnosed with depression find themselves suffering from another condition: ED. Sexual dysfunction is a big problem also in patients with chronic renal failure and seriously affects their quality of life. About 40% of men on dialysis suffer from ED. Many uremic patients have additional symptoms including reduction of libido and a decreased frequency of sexual intercourse. With the start of dialysis some of these symptoms may improve, without, however, returning to normal.",

Behaviour during adolescence is driven by hormonal changes like increase in growth hormone, steroid hormones etc. There is pruning of neural pathways, such that the parts of brain that are most active during adolescence are best developed and those parts that are not utilized remain under-developed later on in adulthood. Common mental disorders during adolescence are emotional disorders like anxiety disorders, depression; conduct disorders like oppositional defiant disorders; hyperkinetic disorders and other psychotic disorders. Multiple tools or questionnaires are available to apply on adolescents and children for screening as well as diagnosing them with mental disorders like Rutter Child Scale A and Rutter Child Scale B, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), K-SADS (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia), ISC (Interview Schedule for Children), CAS (Child Assessment Schedule), CAPA (Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment), DISC (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children) and the DICA (Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents) etc. Poverty, social disadvantage, violence, child abuse, academic failure are some of the risk factors associated with mental disorders. Prevalence of any psychiatric disorder in India is 11% and 8% among boys and girls respectively compared to US where it is 46% in the age group of 13-16 years irrespective of sex. nothing much has been achieved for adolescents under national mental health programme.

Tous les malades choisis pour cette étude présentaient des signes d'immaturité physique; tous révélaient des symptômes, en diverses combinaisons, des états endocriniens suivants:1. Retard de la croissance et du poids2. Défaut de fonction thyroïde3. Défaut de fonction du cortex surrénal4. Retard dans le développement des gonades.Le diagnostic de défaut de fonctionnement de l'hypophyse antérieure était évident.Les sujets ont été traités aux hormones thyroïdienne ou gonadotrophique ou une combinaison des deux vu qu'elles ont toutes deux la réputation d'influer directement sur les états mentaux. On n'a pas utilisé l'hormone de la croissance.Quatre anamnèses sont données pour illustrer les constatations. Dans trois cas, les sujets présentaient un défaut marqué du fonctionnement des gonades. Après un traitement aux hormones gonado-trophiques chorioniques, un sujet a présenté une hausse marquée du taux d'excrétion par 24 heures des 17-cétostéroïdes et en même temps, une amélioration marquée dans l'échelle des cotes de comportement. Lorsqu'on a discontinué temporaitement le traitement, les cotes ont baissé de nouveau. Après reprise du traitement, les testicules augmentèrent de volume et le canal inguinal se ferma. Les points obtenus par le deuxième malade sur l'échelle des cotes au début du traitement montrait une chute initiale ressemblant à la période d'agitation qui se produit au cours de la puberté physiologique chez les garçons. Le traitement a été discontinué et il s'est produit un déclin du taux des 17-cétostéroïdes et de l'âge mental. Le troisième sujet avait un faible taux de métabolisme basal. On lui a donné de la thyroïde desséchée; durant le traitement, le taux de métabolisme basai ne s'est élevé qu'une fois jusqu'à la normale; le taux d'excrétion par 24 heures n'a pas changé, mais le sujet a vu son état mental s'améliorer. Le quatrième sujet souffrait d'un défaut de fonctionnement des gonades et de la thyroïde, présentait de petits testicules et un faible taux de métabolisme basai. Après le traitement à l'hormone gonadothrophique, le sujet a fait peu de progrès sauf que sa cote de comportement a monté. Le traitement aux hormones n'a pas influé sur le défaut de fonctionnement de la thyroïde. Après l'institution du traitement à la thyroïde, le taux d'excrétion et celui des corticoïdes se mit à fluctuer, le taux de métabolisme basai monta; la cote de comportement se mit à grimper; le Q.I. resta le même. La taille du sujet augmenta de 4 pouces.Les mongoloïdes étudiés ne souffraient pas de déficience thyroïdienne. On estime que le défaut de fonctionnement des gonades chez les mongoloïdes peut être influencé par des états matériels des gonades au moment de la conception ou durant la grossesse.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Physical fitness plays a critical role in maintaining, or gaining back, optimal health—especially when living with a chronic condition like RA. The benefits of being fit touch every part of our lives—our overall energy level, sleep patterns, psychological and emotional well-being, and relationships. Except when you are experiencing severe or sharp joint pain and noticeable swelling, exercise should be a regular part of your day. The latest research shows that physical conditioning exercise can improve your fitness level without aggravating your RA or causing a flare of symptoms. So whether you have mild, moderate, or severe disease, exercise is an important part of your plan. However, it is important to understand that the type and intensity of exercise may need to be regulated, depending on your disease activity.",

      "title": "Episodic and Chronic Migraine Headache: Breaking Down Barriers to Optimal Treatment and Prevention",
      "abstract": "Migraine is a common disabling primary headache disorder that affects an estimated 36 million A mericans. Migraine headaches often occur over many years or over an individual's lifetime. By definition, episodic migraine is characterized by headaches that occur on fewer than 15 days per month. According to the recent I nternational C lassification of H eadache D isorders (third revision) beta diagnostic criteria, chronic migraine is defined as “headaches on at least 15 days per month for at least 3 months, with the features of migraine on at least 8 days per month.” However, diagnostic criteria distinguishing episodic from chronic migraine continue to evolve. Persons with episodic migraine can remit, not change, or progress to high‐frequency episodic or chronic migraine over time. Chronic migraine is associated with a substantially greater personal and societal burden, more frequent comorbidities, and possibly with persistent and progressive brain abnormalities. Many patients are poorly responsive to, or noncompliant with, conventional preventive therapies. The primary goals of migraine treatment include relieving pain, restoring function, and reducing headache frequency; an additional goal may be preventing progression to chronic migraine. Although all migraineurs require abortive treatment, and all patients with chronic migraine require preventive treatment, there are no definitive guidelines delineating which persons with episodic migraine would benefit from preventive therapy. Five US F ood and D rug A ssociation strategies are approved for preventing episodic migraine, but only injections with onabotulinumtoxin A are approved for preventing chronic migraine. Identifying persons who require migraine prophylaxis and selecting and initiating the most appropriate treatment strategy may prevent progression from episodic to chronic migraine and alleviate the pain and suffering associated with frequent migraine.",

Presentations with psychotic symptoms have been described less frequently. In this report we present the case of a young boy with Wilson's disease who developed psychotic symptoms. A 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with Wilson's disease on the basis of the physical examination findings and low ceruloplasmin levels (8.1 mg/dl). After 2 weeks of being diagnosed with Wilson's disease, he developed an acute onset illness, characterized by delusion of persecution, fearfulness, hypervigilence and decreased sleep. These symptoms were not associated with any confusion, clouding of consciousness, hallucinations and affective symptoms. There was no past or family history of psychosis. One week after the onset of the symptoms he was prescribed tab penicillamine, initially 250 mg/day, which was increased to 500 mg/day after 3 days. After increase in the dose of penicillamine, his psychiatric symptoms worsened and led to hospitalization. A diagnosis of organic delusional disorder (F06.2) due to Wilson's disease was considered. Tab risperidone 1 mg/day was started, and the dose of penicillamine was reduced with which symptoms resolved. Whenever a young adolescent develops psychosis, especially of delusional type, the possibility of Wilson's disease must be considered.",

Whereas Fibromyalgia (FM) include symptoms such as aches, pain, stiffness and powerlessness in the muscles, fatigue, exhaustibility, headache, swelling, numbness, bowel problems, and sleeping difficulties Sometimes, fibromyalgia patients report anxiety, tension, insomnia, and depressive mood, while some patients reported psychiatric disorders such as major depressive and anxiety disorders. Fibromyalgia (FM) often categorized, as a ‘functional somatic syndrome’, or sometimes, ‘somatization disorder’. Both CFS and FM share the symptomatology to a large extent. Patients with fibromyalgia also meet the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome whereas individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome also manifest concurrent fibromyalgia. In absence of any biomedical test or a stable physiological marker, researchers also conceptualize chronic fatigue syndrome as a psychiatric disorder, or manifestation of a psychiatric condition such as somatization disorder. The present paper is a review of the studies conducted in the area to understand the nature, clinical picture and causal factors for these conditions. It is also aimed to provide the information about the underlying mechanism of CFS and FM to counsellors to incorporate this body of knowledge while counselling with the similar kind of problems.",

      "abstract": "Official statistics indicate that during the last decade, the frequency of borderline mental disorders has rapidly increased. Among those disorders significant numbers involve neurotic and somatoform disorders, reactive depressions, disorders of adaptation, and acute, prolonged, or delayed reactions to stress. Adverse environmental conditions and the vulnerability of individual personalities are considered to play a leading role in the genesis of these disorders. The range of psychogenic factors that give rise to borderline disorders is relatively broad; they include negative macrosocial processes, changes in way of life, extreme situations in war and peacetime, interpersonal conflicts, difficult family situations, personal failures, misfortunes, losses, etc. The development of pathological symptoms is accompanied by maladjustment, disruptions in the patient's social interactions and functioning in the community, family, everyday life, and on the job, and a decrease in the value and quality of life all of which frequently lead to various behavioral deviations: suicidal behavior, aggressive and criminal acts, and/or alcoholism and drug addiction [1, 4, 5].

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Pain is well known to be a common dominant symptom in people with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). Perhaps less well acknowledged by healthcare professionals are fatigue and sleep disturbances in these patients. Individually these symptoms are problematic but when combined their effect and impact on patients' lives is greatly amplified; often leaving people in a vicious cycle whereby being in pain results in poor sleep leading to fatigue the next day, which lowers patients' pain tolerance resulting in a poorer night\"s sleep, more fatigue and increased pain. Pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance greatly reduce quality of life for people with RMDs. Patients have to adapt their daily and leisure activities, or give them up altogether with negative psychological consequences such as anxiety and depression. Patients can end up feeling helpless and sometimes suicidal. Relationships with partners and friends are often altered affecting their sexual and social lives. Major life decisions, such as having a baby, can be put on hold or shelved. People with RMDs may also have to reduce their working hours or stop working, which has financial repercussions for them and their families. This can exacerbate stress, anxiety and depression leading to poorer health outcomes. It is therefore of great importance that healthcare professionals understand the extent to which pain, fatigue and sleep difficulties impact on patients' lives so that priority can be given to addressing these distressing symptoms as part of any management strategy. <h3>Disclosure of Interests:</h3> None declared",

In most subjects with dysmorphophobia there was comorbidity of dysthymia or major depression. An improvement in the state of these patients, most often after implementation of complex therapeutic measures: psychotherapy as well as pharmacotherapy with neuroleptic and SSRI's or clomipramine has to do with withdrawal of delusions, whereas the symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder usually last for years.

      "abstract": "L'évaluation de l'irritation sensorielle et des effets neurocomportementaux de l'exposition à des associations complexes de solvants souléve une multiplicité de défis méthodologiques, particulièrement aux faibles doses couramment détectées dans les bâtiments récents. Des jeunes adultes masculins en bonne santé ont été exposés à un mélange de 22 composés organiques volatiles (VOC) d'une concentration de 25mg par m 3 , la plus élevée qui ait été trouvée dans des logements neufs. Une telle concentration équivant à environ 7ppm de toluène. Ce mélange n'a pas de conséquences sur les performances à une batterie neurocomportementale à large champ d'investigation, mais provoque les symptômes classiques du mal des immeubles: l'irritation des yeux et de la gorge, des céphalées et de la fatigue. L'échec de la mise en évidence de déficits fonctionnels pourrait étre dûà plusieurs facteurs: (1) les tests neurocomportementaux peuvent ne pas avoir été assez sensibles ou assez difficiles pour détecter des effets; (2) les jeunes adultes masculins en bonne santé sont sans doute, dans la population générale, les moins sujects à présenter une détérioration des performances. D'autres études s'imposent si l'on veut savoir qui est le plus vulnérable à l'exposition aux basses concentrations de solvants; (3) finalement, les associations de VOC à faible densité peuvent bien ne pas être neurotoxiques. D'autres cibles physiologiques, telles que la réponse inflammatoire et les fonctions pulmonaires, doivent être explorées. Assessment of sensory irritant and neurobehavioural effects of exposure to complex solvent mixtures poses a variety of methodological challenges, particularly at the low levels typically found in new buildings. Healthy young adult males were exposed to a 25mg/m 3 mixture of 22 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) representative of the highest concentration found in new homes. This concentration is equivalent to about 7ppm toluene. This mixture produced no consistent effects on performance of an extensive neurobehavioural battery, but did elicit classical “sick building syndrome” (SBS) symptoms of eye and throat irritation, headache and fatigue. Failure to find functional deficits could be due to several factors: (1) The neurobehavioural tests may not have been sensitive (or difficult) enough to detect effects; (2) healthy young adult males are probably the least likely subset of the general population to show performance decrements. Further study is needed to determine which subsets are most vulnerable to low‐level solvent exposure; (3) finally, low‐level VOC mixtures may not be neurotoxic. Other physiological endpoints (e. g. inflammatory response and pulmonary function), need to be explored.",

      "abstract": "La detresse consecutive aux attaques de panique (AP) est principalement liee a l'interpretation faite de ces manifestations. En outre, il est frequent qu'un individu qui vit des AP pense etre en proie a un trouble physique. Ainsi, il est commun que ces individus recourent aux services de sante en raison des AP (Roy-Byrne et coll., 1999). Par ailleurs, 1,1% des sujets aux prises avec un trouble panique adoptent des conduites d'evitement agoraphobique, une condition qui est associee a un niveau de morbidite (severite, handicap et comorbidite) plus eleve (Kessler et coll., 2006). Le trouble panique accompagne ou non d'agoraphobie (TP/A) presente une forte comorbidite avec des conditions psychiatriques (p. ex. depression, maladie bipolaire, autres troubles anxieux) et medicales (p. ex. dysfonctions vestibulaires, asthme, maladie de meniere, prolapsus de la valve mitrale) (Birchall, Brandon et Taub, 2000; Morris et coll., 1997; Spinhoven, 1994). En outre, certains dysfonctionnements corporels impliquent une symptomatologie similaire a celle des AP, ce qui complique la reconnaissance et te traitement du TP/A (Rosenbaum, 1997). II apparait des lors important de mieux definir (1) les relations entre le TP/A et les conditions, physiques et psychiatriques, qui y sont comorbides, et (2) les composantes cognitives et comportementales susceptibles de maintenir le trouble. La presente recherche doctorale s'inscrit dans cette visee, car elle s'attarde a mieux comprendre les liens entre le TP/A et certaines variables associees soit: les dysfonctions vestibulaires et l'attitude envers la pratique d'activites physiques. Elle comporte un releve des ecrits scientifiques et deux articles empiriques. L'echantillon clinique est constitue de 141 sujets d'origine canadienne francaise aux prises avec un TP/A actuel ou en remission. Ces diagnostics sont etablis a l'aide d'entrevues semi-structurees. Ils sont recrutes a partir d'une vaste etude menee sur le territoire quebecois qui s'interesse aux marqueurs genetiques du TP/A. Les donnees cliniques sont comparees a un echantillon controle de 235 sujets recrutes au sein de classes de premier cycle universitaire en psychologie. Le chapitre I constitue une mise en contexte generale. Il situe la problematique du TP/A en lien avec les troubles du systeme de l'equilibre et il comporte un bref survol de l'etude de la pratique d'activites physiques chez les sujets TP/A. Les liens etablis entre les dysfonctions du systeme vestibulaire (DV) et le TP/A sont revus. Des informations pertinentes a la comprehension des pathologies qui caracterisent les DV sont introduites. Le chapitre II presente une recension des ecrits scientifiques portant sur le TP/A et les DV. Cet article situe ces problematiques en termes de prevalence et de comorbidite et il revoit les modeles explicatifs qui peuvent rendre compte de cette comorbidite TP/A. Les caracteristiques pouvant etre des indicateurs des sujets aux prises avec cette comorbidite sont relevees. Cette revue, intitulee Comorbidite du trouble panique et des troubles de l'equilibre: Etat de la question, a ete publiee dans la revue L'Encephale. Le chapitre IIl presente la premiere recherche empirique de la these qui etudie l'inconfort spatio-moteur (ISM) aupres de sujets aux prises avec un TP/A. L'ISM, qui refere aux symptomes ressentis lors de situations ou les informations sont inadequates pour etre bien oriente dans l'espace, pourrait constituer un marqueur des individus susceptibles de presenter une DV. Une validation de la version francaise de l'instrument qui mesure l'ISM et les principaux resultats comparatifs obtenus sur le niveau d'ISM des sujets sont rapportes. Cette etude, intitulee L'inconfort spatio-moteur: Un marqueur des dysfonctions vestibulaires chez les sujets avec un trouble panique, est en voie d'etre soumise pour publication a la Revue Francophone de Clinique Comportementale et Cognitive. Le chapitre IV explore la conduite des sujets aux prises avec un TP/A en regard de la pratique d'activites physiques. Les resultats indiquent que les sujets TP/A, actuels et en remission, sont davantage portes a craindre certaines sensations physiques issues de telles activites. Cela incite a se questionner sur les particularites du style cognitif des sujets en remission qui pourraient les rendre plus vulnerables a la rechute. Cette etude, intitulee Une etude exploratoire des attitudes en regard de l'activite physique dans le trouble panique, est en revision pour publication a la Revue Canadienne des Sciences du Comportement.\r\nFinalement, le chapitre V constitue une reflexion sur l'integration des resultats obtenus. Il fait le point sur les conclusions en regard de l'inconfort spatio-moteur comme marqueur possible des dysfonctions vestibulaires chez les sujets TP/A. Les elements principaux de l'etude qui porte sur l'attitude des sujets TP/A envers la pratique d'activites physiques sont aussi mis en lumiere. Les considerations d'ordre methodologique de la recherche et des pistes pour l'elaboration des recherches futures sont suggerees. ______________________________________________________________________________ MOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : Trouble panique, Agoraphobie, Dysfonctions vestibulaires, Inconfort spatiomoteur, Activites physiques, Evitement.",

      "abstract": "Introducción: El Trastorno Dismórfico Corporal es un trastorno propio de la adolescencia, poco conocido y poco tenido en cuenta en la clínica diaria con niños y adolescentes, lo que demora el diagnóstico y empeora el pronóstico. Métodos: Con el objetivo de realizar una revisión práctica para el clínico infanto-juvenil, se realizó una búsqueda electrónica en las principales bases de datos junto a una búsqueda manual en revistas y tratados especializados. Resultados: El trastorno es muy común, con prevalencias del 1,7 al 2,5%. Dos terceras partes de los casos se inician en la adolescencia y una edad de inicio más temprana se asocia a mayor probabilidad de comorbilidad a lo largo de la evolución y a un mayor riesgo suicida. Se trata de un trastorno del espectro obsesivo-compulsivo que implica preocupaciones persistentes por uno o más defectos físicos percibidos y que no son observables por otras personas, así como comportamientos compulsivos en respuesta a dichas preocupaciones. La vergüenza y el miedo al rechazo promueven que el adolescente no explique sus síntomas y es muy habitual la demora de años en el diagnóstico, que si llega a establecerse, lo hace por lo general en la edad adulta. El curso es crónico y en caso de no diagnosticarse, el pronóstico será pobre con frecuente aislamiento social y deterioro funcional. Un diagnóstico correcto y a tiempo mejorará mucho la evolución, tratándose de un trastorno que responde bien a los tratamientos tanto farmacológicos como psicológicos. Conclusión: Conocer el trastorno dismórfico corporal es muy importante para diagnosticarlo a tiempo en el adolescente, lo cual mejorará el pronóstico de forma clara.",

It complicates both psychiatric and somatic disorders and is associated with reduced survival, poor functional results, increased duration of hospital stay, and institutionalization. Diagnosis remains difficult in spite of the improvement of the diagnostic criteria, due to the polymorphism of the clinical signs and fluctuation of vigilance and cognition. Age over 70 and previous cognitive impairment are the main risk factors. Precipitating factors are medical and surgical pathologies, intoxications, especially by therapeutic drugs. Delirium can reveal or complicate a previous dementia. Prevention of delirium and care of the delirious patient require the participation of both the medical and nursing staff.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Symptom (from Greek symptoma “anything that has befallen one”) is an each new manifestation by which some disorder is expressed. For the physician, it is a guide to diagnosis itself, and for the patient it is a signal which warns of new conditions of the body and soul or of a disorder. Objectives Mental disorders are most commonly presented by a group of symptoms, among which the patients often can’t point out the leading one. Anxiety as a symptom can occur in a number of psychiatric entities and it can stimulate differential diagnostic dilemma in daily practice. We will show a 26-year female in which the internal anxiety is the main symptom. Aim To underlined the importance of taking in to account a leading symptom of the disease in the way of establishing the correct diagnosis. Methods The psychiatric and psychotherapeutic interviews were performed together with a clinical assessment of mental status and structured clinical interviews (SCID I and SCID II), EEG and psychological testing. Results/conclusion Internal discomfort is a subjective feeling, respectively a symptom which the patient in this case continuously underlined, and which guided us (along with a comprehensive analysis) to a clear diagnosis. Following the choosing of an effective psycho-pharmacological combination, and with the goal of reducing a leading symptom, according to enlarged diagnostic process, we decided to diagnose the Schizoaffective disorders (F 25.2).",

With appropriate sensitivity, the interviewer should physically demonstrate motor tics when inquiring about their presence. If duration of tics is less than 1 year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Other Specified Tic Disorder or Unspecified Tic Disorder and skip to Vocal Tics. Symptoms must have persisted for at least 1 year, although they could wax and wane in frequency, and onset of symptoms must be prior to age 18. It is very important to distinguish interference due to tics from distress due to other comorbid problems such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). If only motor tics or vocal tics are present and they occurred many times a day, for less than 1 year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Provisional Tic Disorder.",

      "title": "Quadri internistici ed endocrinologici connessi alla disabilitŕ grave",
      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

Patients with this syndrome have uncomfortable sensations in their legs (and sometimes arms or other parts of the body), with moving their legs to relieve this sensations. The symptoms of RLS are usually worse in the evening and at night. The diagnosis of RLS is primarily based on clinical evaluation and clinical history of the patient. International restless leg syndrome group study (IRLSSG) evaluates the symptoms and severity of RLS. RLS can be divided into two groups of primary and secondary. Iron deficiency, Parkinson’s disease, kidney failure, diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and pregnancy may cause RLS. Antinausea, antipsychotic drugs, some antidepressants, and antihistamines may also worsen the symptoms. RLS is also observed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which makes the outcomes  worse. COPD is a main preventable health problem that can lead to morbidity and mortality. Thus, RLS in COPD causes excessive daytime hypersomnolence, fatigue, poor quality of life, disability and neuropsychological complications such as social isolation, frequent daytime headaches, anxiety and depression.",

Cognitively, anticipating potential future risk scenarios may help in minimising threat, suggesting that obsessivecompulsive disorder may be a by-product of foresight. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is often linked to life events that require heightened vigilance for threat, including sexual maturation (puberty), pregnancy, and childbirth.

      "title": "Stressing out, or outing stress?",
      "abstract": "Stress is an unavoidable component of our working life. How we deal with it may have profound consequences for our job satisfaction, our health and the standard of care we are able to give our patients [1]. Any stressful event will elicit a characteristic physiological response consisting of autonomic stimulation and heightened arousal, which will then persist to some degree for the duration of the stressful stimulus. During an acutely stressful event, such as an intraoperative critical incident, this 'fight or flight' reaction may directly contribute to the resolution of the stressful event. On the other hand, because chronic occupational stresses such as poor working conditions or extended hours are seldom amenable to rapid resolution, the fight or flight reaction in these circumstances may be both inappropriate and ineffective. Our ability to tolerate stress is the result of a complicated interaction of inconstant factors. These include our own personality and coping skills, our current levels of fatigue, distraction or frustration, our experience of previous stressors, the strength of our social or occupational support and, not least, the nature of the stressor itself. However, a fundamental component is our individual 'locus of control' [2]. This term describes our belief in our ability to influence events around us, individuals who believe they have this ability having an 'internal' locus, in contrast to those with an 'external' locus who place more emphasis on the role of chance. Individuals with an internal locus of control tend to report less occupational stress than those without it [3]. Recent studies of occupational stress in nurses have demonstrated the complex relation between the perception of stress and the character of the individual. In a study comparing occupational stress between intensive care unit (ICU) nurses and non-ICU nurses, the ICU nurses found that their ICU nursing activities were less stressful than non-ICU nurses found their non-ICU nursing tasks to be [4]. The authors concluded that ICU nurses had maximized their job satisfaction, and minimized their occupational stress, by selecting a speciality that offered them the high degree of personal autonomy and job complexity which they required for personal fulfilment. In a separate study, when ICU nurses were asked to specify the most stressful aspect of being an ICU patient they selected items relating to loss of personal control significantly more frequently than ICU patients did when given the same questionnaire [5]. The association of a preference for working in a stressful environment, a strong need for personal autonomy and an internal locus of control has been described as 'Type A' behaviour [6]. This rather loose term also includes characteristics such as self-confidence and a strong work commitment, a preference to work alone when under pressure and an urgent sense of time pressure. Type A behaviour is observed more frequently in doctors than in other health professionals, and is associated with a high level of job satisfaction, a low perception of occupational stress and a low requirement for sick leave [2]. Although the prevalence of Type A behaviour in different medical specialities has not been studied, it is likely that doctors who have chosen a speciality in which they usually work alone, and in an environment over which they can exert a high degree of personal control, might be expected to display marked Type A behaviour patterns. Many anaesthetists and intensivists will recognize this as a description of their own working practice. If Type A behaviour offers a degree of protection against the consequences of choosing a profession with a high exposure to occupational stress [3], and if doctors in general, and anaesthetists in particular, display a high prevalence of this behaviour, is there any need to be concerned about our exposure to stress in the workplace? The obverse to the high-achieving behaviour of the Type A individual is their tendency to suppress symptoms of fatigue, and sacrifice their own and their family's social needs, to their pursuit of a successful career [6]. This is exemplified by the results of a survey of occupational stress in health professionals, which demonstrated that doctors made less use of coping strategies such as social support, and were less able to separate home and work, than almost any other group [2]. It has even been suggested that health workers have a particular susceptibility to occupational stress because of the emotional stresses to which they are exposed [7], particularly if they have not been trained to deal with these aspects of their work [8]. Occupational stress is usually beyond the individual's control, and is therefore exactly the form of stress with which competitive, achievement-orientated Type A individuals are least able to deal [3]. In the face of such stressors, individuals may adopt coping strategies such as denial or rationalization which, whilst providing apparent short-term relief, actually perpetuate the individual's exposure to the stressor. Furthermore, although decreasing the individual's emotional involvement in a stressful situation may be helpful in the short-term, in the face of continued exposure these coping mechanisms can lead to a growing sense of detachment and cynicism, impairing the health professional's ability to emphathize with their patient, and resulting in a progressive reduction in job satisfaction. If their home and work environment are already poorly separated, the emotional detachment is likely to extend into the individual's home life, and slowly erode the support it previously offered [9]. In the long term, this will increase the doctor's vulnerability to prolonged stress and lead to social isolation, professional over-involvement, emotional exhaustion and 'burn out' [2]. Finally, the sustained fight or flight response elicited by continued exposure to the stressor may itself present a significant threat to the doctor's own health, through an increased risk of cardiovascular or infectious disease, as well as depression, anxiety and excessive alcohol consumption [10-12]. Another, more recent, factor adds a potent source of stress to this fragile structure. The protective effect of an internal locus of control on the perception of occupational stress is diminished if the individual feels they have lost control of the stressor. The recent organizational changes to the delivery of health care in many developed countries, with the consequent reduction in doctors' autonomy, poses exactly this risk. A recent study has confirmed an increase in the level of occupational stress, and a fall in morale, amongst doctors as a consequence of these changes [13]. These changes illustrate the challenge that is facing the profession. As doctors, we have chosen to work in a highly competitive, achievement-orientated environment. As anaesthetists and intensivists, we have selected a speciality in which our high degree of personal autonomy, and our control over our environment, contribute to our job satisfaction. Yet, as individuals, we are faced with a growing burden of occupational stressors that fall outside our control, and with which we are poorly equipped to deal. Since we are unlikely to be able to reduce our exposure to these stresses significantly, we should take steps to improve our ability to deal with them. The first of these steps is to acknowledge our exposure to stresses beyond our control. The observations on doctors' behaviour through the centuries suggest that we are not good at conceding our own vulnerability and that, as care givers, we make poor recipients. This should not be a point of pride. Second, we need to accept that not only are we probably not as good at dealing with these stresses as we might like to believe, but also that they may compromise both our health and the health and happiness of our families. Finally, we have to equip the next generation of doctors with the skills they will need to meet the roles they will encounter in the course of their careers. This does not simply mean training doctors to deal with identifiable stresses such as starting a new job [8], comforting the bereaved [14] or managing the department [15], although this is important. We also need to develop a working environment in which we have the skills to support our juniors and the expectation that our colleagues will support us. Clearly this cannot be imposed by management directive. Rather it is the responsibility of us all to learn how to provide support to our colleagues, and to encourage them to support us. Stress, like mortality, involves us all, and denial is no cure. C. E. Granger Blackpool M. P. Shelly Manchester",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent and understudied mental health problems in late life. Specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder are the most prevalent anxiety disorders in older adults among the 11 disorders identified by the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (fifth edition). Anxiety disorders lead to significant functional burdens and interface with physical health problems and cognitive impairment, concerns frequently experienced in adults over age 65. Additional contextual factors should be considered when assessing and treating late-life anxiety, including the effects of polypharmacy, other mental health conditions, role changes, and societal attitudes toward aging. The relationship between anxiety and physical health problems in older adults can be causal or contextual, and can involve poorer estimates of subjective health and lower ratings of functioning. These factors present unique challenges to the detection, conceptualization, and treatment of late-life anxiety, including the tendency for older adults to focus on somatic symptoms and the potential for long-term behaviors that can mask distress such as substance use. Researchers are increasingly incorporating a gerodiversity framework to understand the contributions of cultural, individual, and other group differences that may affect the presentation of anxiety symptoms and disorders. Older adults in general are less likely to be treated for anxiety disorders, and intersecting individual and group differences likely further affect how anxiety disorders are perceived by healthcare providers. Cognitive behavioral therapy and its variants have the most empirical support for treatment. Newer evidence lends support to acceptance and commitment therapy and problem-solving therapy, which tend to address some of the contextual factors that may be important in treatment.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe, frequent, heterogeneous, longlasting and disabling chronic mental illness with high social impact, belonging to the group of chronic psychoses. There are several clinical forms and several possible evolutionary modes. Its etiopathogenesis is multifactorial (hereditary, biological, environmental, etc.) but no single cause has been demonstrated up till now. Schizophrenia is a group of disabling heterogeneous disorders that are generally severe, the course of which is chronic and disabling, and the prognosis is poor. Many retrospective studies have attempted to trace the premorbid history of adult subjects who developed schizophrenia. Their results appear to be extremely disparate, due in particular to the heterogeneity of the means of investigation used. In addition, in recent years, many studies have focused on prodromal symptoms occurring during the year preceding the first psychotic episode in late adolescence or early adulthood. Minor physical cranio-cerebral (at the level of the ears, the palate, the cranial perimeter), temporomandibular, dental and palatal abnormalities, dermatoglyphic disturbances or even subtle neurological signs have been frequently found in schizophrenic patients, in particular oral anomalies, more precisely the measurements of the teeth, their vestibulo-lingual and mesio-distal diameters. The objective of our article is to study the morphological abnormalities that exist in the patient with schizophrenia, and to demonstrate whether there is a link between the presence of these physical abnormalities and the occurrence of schizophrenia. This issue has been vaguely mentioned in the literature, but in the Moroccan context, it is a pilot study.",

      "title": "Analysis of Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Variations in Psychological Stress",
      "abstract": "Purpose: Mental stress and other psychosomatic disorders have been linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in population studies. There hasn't been a thorough examination as to whether emotional or physical stresses might cause sporadic ventricular arrhythmias in vulnerable patients. An outsized and mounting body of discovery shed light on the fact that internal health is interrelated to risk factors for heart complaint before an opinion of an internal health complaint and through treatment. These things can arise both directly, through natural pathways, and laterally, through parlous health actions. People who are passing through clinical depression, anxiety disorders, common and general stress syndromes, and indeed post-traumatic stress disorder commonly known as PTSD over an absolute period of your occasion may observe definite physiological alterations in the body, similarly, as a highly enlarged cardiac reactivity such as augmented vital signs and elevated blood pressure, deducted or condensed blood inflow directly to the center, and heightened or highly raised amount of an organic chemical compound called cortisol. Over time, these physiologic processes may generate calcium particle depositions or buildup within the normal organic pathways. It may also manifest events of body metabolic dysfunction as well as cardiac conduction problems. Substantiation shows that many physiological and psychiatric/psychological diseases -similar to chronic clinical depression, psychological stress, and PTSD can appear after any cardiac event regardless of its severity. Objective: The focal objective of this article is to identify psychological stress, its influence on cardiac problems such as cardiac arrhythmia, and its symptomatic manifestations on an electrocardiogram. Apart from that, this paper also focuses on the area of how ECG changes due to psychological distress. Another objective of this paper is to provide vivid information about psychological stress and its link with acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Laymen should know the fact that the mind and the body are linked with each other and if the mind is distressed for a long time will affect the health condition of the physical body also. Design/Methodology/Approach: To build the paper, mostly secondary information has been used from various sources such as clinical literature, journals, websites, etc. Primary information has also been used to increase the accuracy and reliability of the paper. Primary data have been taken from neuropsychologists, cardiologists, clinical psychopathologists, and behavioral medicine specialists. Based on all these databases, systematic and scientific clinical analysis of information has been done to avoid any mistakes and errors. Findings/Result: In people with ICDs, stress and physical exercise might cause ventricular rhythm abnormalities. Future studies into medicines that prevent these stimuli' responses might reduce ventricular arrhythmias and upsets in some of these patients. People with type A personalities should try to control or adjust their innate personality and character to reduce the vulnerability to develop any kind of cardiac arrhythmia or any other cardiac pathologies. All ECG variations and arrhythmias are not related to psychological stress rather it needs differential diagnosis to rule out any other underlying problems. A thorough differential investigation is suggested to rule out whether the cardiac problem is due to psychological stress or not. Originality and value: A comprehensive analysis and interpretation have been made to cover the concerned topic of study and make information more reliable and valid. A new initiative is taken to provide information about the mind and heart link. Paper Type: Secondary clinical report analysis/interpretive paper",

      "abstract": "The sleep patterns of two groups of children with autism, one with moderate to severe intellectual handicap, and one with mild handicap to normal IQ level, were compared with those of children without autism. Parents completed 14 day sleep diaries and questionnaires. ILesults suggested that at some stage during childhood, particularly under 8 years of age, the majority of children with autism will experience sleep problems. These problems are likely to be severe in many cases and will generally include one or more of. extreme sleep latencies; lengthy periods of night waking; shortened night sleep; and early morning waking. Such problems may have some specificity for autism as they appear to be rare in non-handicapped children and in children with mild degrees of intellectual handicap. It is likely that sleep problems in early childhood are related to the severe social difl:culties present in autism and the consequent inability of these children to use social cues to synchronise their sleep/wake cycle. Continued sleep dilticulties at older ages and with higher IQ may also be related to arousal and anxiety factors.",

      "abstract": "Trauma and stressful events can disrupt the physiologic homeostasis of our bodies and brains. The physiologic stress response consists of neural and endocrine mechanisms whose function is to reestablish homeostasis. These mechanisms include the secretion of glucocorticoids (cortisol) and catecholemines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). Once an external event has ceased to be a stressor or threat to a human organism, an integrated system of negative feedback loops inhibits the continued production of these hormones and effectively shuts down the stress response. These mechanisms are adaptive in the sense that they ensure the survival of the organism by reestablishing homeostasis. But prolonged exposure to real or perceived stressors can trigger prolonged secretion of stress hormones, thereby disrupting the feedback systems and causing a cascade of pathogenic events. The stress response is a double-edged sword. An acute stress response can protect an organism from external threats and reestablish homeostasis. But a chronic stress response can cause the body's defenses to become damaging rather than protective and to result in various disorders. Acute stress responses are adaptive. Chronic stress responses are often maladaptive and pathogenic.",

      "title": "Cardiac Diseases and Anxiety Disorders",
      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are amongst the most common psychiatric disorders in all over the world. Its an emotion that prepares the individual to the environmental changes or helps to create a response to those changes. Also there are psychological symptoms such as distress, excitement and a precognition and fear of suddenly something bad going to happen. Anxiety is a symptom that could be seen in many organic disorder and can accompany almost any psychiatric disorder. The relationship between anxiety and cardiovascular system (CVS), is known since the first studies on individuals the 1870's so-called irritable cardiac diseases. With tachycardia and palpitations as a result of severe fear and anxiety related issues, has become a focus of interest in studies that examine the activity of CVS. Nowadays, the relationship between psychological factors and cardiac disease have been discussed. Because creation potential of the sudden death due to cardiac diseases are more sensitive to the psychiatric disorders and development of any cardiac disease might start serious mental issues. These situations are the main subjects of psychocardiology. In addition, mental disorders which has similar symptoms of cardiac diseases (panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), etc.) is another problem area. Anxious thoughts causes reduced autonomic variability condition which is a result of decrease in vagal tone. The first reaction to stress is muscle weakness and a feeling of heart stopping due to parasympathic activation. A short time later, the sympathetic system is activated, sweating, palpitation, tremors, rapid and deep breathing begin. When they do challenging activities or concerned there will be cardiovascular variability and falls occur phasic parasympathetic tone. Studies on this subject emphasize cardiac sensitization caused by sympathetic activity. According to this stimulation of central and peripheral adrenergic structures, catecholamine infusion and behavioral stress can cause cardiac sensitivity in both healthy and ischemic heart. Cardiac diseases within the psychiatric views (whether or syndromal levels of disorder matter), surely, should be recognized and addressed. Patients who work under heavy stressful conditions suffers from continuous excreting of catecholamine with the further aggravated cardiac disease. At the same time, anxiety is caused by a decrease in vagal control also increases the susceptibility to coronary cardiac disease. On most cardiac diseases cases, an intense anger and hostile attitude follows the anxiety. Anxiety came out tops as a leading emotional problem for cardiac patients when it unites with other negative emotions. As a result, the importance of early diagnosis and treatment is obvious due to the reason that occurring simultaneously psychiatric views which emerges with cardiac diseases to cause the illness to worsen.

The spells generally appear during the first two years of life, but rarely before 6 months of age. They usually disappear spontaneously after 4 years of age and rarely recur after age 6 years. Breathholding episodes are observed almost exclusively in children with normal intelligence and do not cause demonstrable evidence of brain damage. However, they are frequently associated with or followed by behavioral disturbances. The familial incidence is high. Breathholding attacks are essentially innocuous and the general outlook is excellent. The associated unconsciousness and convulsions are very short and benign, and require no immediate care. The administration of antiepileptic or tranquilizing drugs or both is of no value. Treatment consists primarily of parent-child guidance and reassurance.",

Due to the chronic nature of CBDs, psychological complications are relatively common in these patients, which can affect treatment adherence, quality of life, and even the frequency of bleeding episodes. Chronic pain causes many psychological problems in CBDs, disrupting their social interactions, affecting all aspects of their lives, including their emotional functioning and behavior, and eventually leading to social exclusion. About one-third of patients with severe hemophilia A suffer from anxiety, 64% from depression, and 60% from other minor psychological complications such as withdrawal/depression, anxiety/depression, attention problems, and emotional problems. Anxiety, depression, and uncontrolled pain interfere with treatment adherence. For this reason, psychological interventions are needed in people with CBDs. Psychological interventions increase quality of life and treatment adherence. Therefore, early recognition of psychological complications in CBD patients may increase treatment adherence, leading to a reduction in bleeding episodes and thus an improvement in quality of life.",

      "abstract": "A post-traumatic vegetative state that holds for more than 12 months is defined as “permanent”, implying a very low probability of regaining consciousness. Here we report on a patient who emerged from a traumatic vegetative state after 20 months. Beginning from the 6th month, we observed an improvement in the event-related potentials (ERPs) of his brain to complex sensory and verbal stimulation, although the clinical examinations remained unchanged. The possible role of ERPs as predictors of regaining consciousness after a vegetative state is discussed.\n\nThe vegetative state is a most severe neurological syndrome and includes the loss of all kinds of conscious behaviour despite preserved wakefulness.1 In patients with traumatic head injury, a vegetative state that holds for more than 1 year is considered to be “permanent”, which implies irreversibility. In fact, even minimal improvement after this period is extremely improbable. From time to time, however, cases of late emergence are reported,2,3 sometimes even 5 years after the incident.4 The statement “The available data are insufficient to provide a trustworthy estimate of the incidence of late improvement” (Childs and Merger,3 p 24) is still valid; figures varying as broadly as from 1.6% to 14% have been reported.1,3\n\nGiven the rarity of such cases, the slightest hint that such an unexpected improvement may occur would be useful. Here we describe a patient in whom cognitive components of cortical ERPs were consistently obtained for more than 1 year before clinical recovery.\n\nA 28-year-old man was admitted to an intensive care unit with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 after a severe car accident.

      "title": "Sleep Disorders and Headache",
      "abstract": "Insomnia, difficulty with falling or staying asleep, is the most common sleep complaint among patients with frequent headaches. Insomnia can be related to conditions common among headache patients, such as depression, anxiety, lack of exercise, and medications that make good sleep harder to achieve. Patients with chronic migraine, which includes headache 15 or more days per month, report having almost twice the rates of insomnia as those with less frequent headaches. Rates of sleepiness in the daytime and snoring are also more frequent in those with frequent headaches. Patients with chronic headaches are more likely to be depressed or anxious, which can further worsen sleep problems. Separating out all these issues is sometimes necessary, but also addressing all of the problems without just focusing on only one area is more likely to result in success. Clues to there being a primary sleep disorder in addition to a headache disorder include snoring, gasping during the night, falling asleep during the day, and not feeling rested upon awakening. The overwhelming need to move one's legs when trying to sleep can further disrupt sleep, and is frequently associated with restless legs syndrome. Before a doctor visit to address a possible sleep disorder, it is useful to have a sleep diary in hand. Write down the activities in the hour before bed, the time it takes to get to sleep, the number of awakenings, the total sleep time, and the impression of being rested or tired the next day for each day of the week. Include evening meal times, exercise, and activity in the 4 hours prior to falling asleep. Caffeine intake, energy drinks, weight loss supplements, and any migraine medications, especially those containing caffeine, need to be recorded. Bringing this diary to the office visit can sometimes lead to effective changes that do not involve taking another medicine, and targeted changes can enhance well-being and function throughout the day. Many find that if they can improve sleep time and quality of sleep, headaches do improve. If the sleep log seems to suggest possible sleep apnea, restless legs, or another sleep disorder that requires monitoring for a definitive diagnosis, a formal sleep evaluation will be recommended. While sleeping, the patient is monitored for irregular breathing, temporary obstruction of the airway while relaxed, levels of oxygen, or involuntary movement of the arms or legs while sleeping. Based on these findings, behavioral changes, airway devices, or medicines may be recommended. Many times, consistent behavioral changes are needed for those with headaches and sleep problems. Those with chronic headache tend to cut back on physical activity because exercise temporarily seems to worsen headaches. People with frequent headaches often spend more time resting, lying down, or sitting. This in turn results in being less tired at night. Naps during the day are common. Lack of activity and exercise can worsen depression and anxiety, further adding to difficultly falling and staying asleep. Engaging in restful and non-stress producing activities before going to sleep can set the stage for a better night's sleep. Computer activities, mobile phone devices, and stress-producing work should be avoided in the hour before sleep. The aim is to set aside enough time for 7-8 hours of sleep. This is better achieved by going to bed within an hour of the same time every night, and getting up at similar times. A not uncommon migraine problem is sleeping in on weekends after a long week of not getting quite enough sleep. Catching up on sleep often leads to a wake-up weekend headache, which is frustrating, as this is the time people want to be with their families, run errands, and have fun. This headache coming on after stress has decreased is called let-down headache, and it is unfortunately common. Also common is wake-up headache. The most common time for migraine to occur is in the early morning, and many times people will sleep through the time when a headache is beginning to emerge. By missing the best time to take migraine medicines, which is early in the headache, the medicines are less likely to be effective. Individuals who take their pain and headache medications too frequently, that is, have medication overuse headache, can experience their medications wearing off during the night, triggering a headache. Most over-the-counter and narcotic pain medications wear off in 4-8 hours, making people most vulnerable during the early morning, particularly if overusing these medications. There are unusual headache disorders closely timed to sleep hours. For instance, cluster headache is often called the alarm clock headache, as it will wake a sufferer at a similar time every night with excruciating pain. There may be a link between cluster headache and sleep apnea, with the drop of oxygen while sleeping possibly triggering an attack. Another headache disorder linked to sleep, typically occurring a few hours after falling asleep, is hypnic headache, mostly affecting the elderly. This is sometimes treated with a dose of caffeine before bed, which is sort of a paradox. For most people, frequent intake of caffeine leads to a worsening of a sleep disorder. The caffeine wears off during the night, resulting in a caffeine withdrawal headache. If caffeine is taken too close to bedtime, it can worsen insomnia with trouble falling asleep and restless awakenings. Many over-the-counter migraine medications, as well as butalbital combination tablets, contain caffeine, leading to rebound headaches, withdrawal headaches, and insomnia. If behavioral changes are insufficient, medications can be helpful. It is best to go with a medication that is not habit forming, and will not have side effects the next day. The sleep-inducing effect of some medications wears off over time, so these would not be best for long-term use (Table). In summary, headaches and sleep disorders can be closely linked. Examine your activities as you prepare for sleep, exercise habits, intake of caffeine, and other stimulants. Keep a log of your sleep patterns and your headaches, and bring it in to discuss with your provider. Note whether you snore or gasp at night. Behavioral changes are safe and can lead to better health. Medications, carefully chosen, can improve sleep if behavioral changes are not fully effective.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is probably the most used psychoactive substance in the world. Most caffeine intake is in the form of coffee and tea but increasingly in the form of energy drinks. In caffeine intoxication, these symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and are not due to a general medical condition or better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. an anxiety disorder). Nicotine is highly lipid‐soluble and rapidly enters the brain after inhalation. Nicotine receptors are found on dopaminergic cell bodies and stimulation of these receptors leads to dopamine release. Withdrawal symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of stopping smoking and include intense craving, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, difficulty in concentrating and increased appetite. Nicotine withdrawal can be misdiagnosed as depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and mania. Withdrawal can also exacerbate the symptoms of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Some chronobiological considerations related to physical exercise.",
      "abstract": "Variables associated with physical activity show circadian rhythms in resting subjects; these rhythms have both exogenous (due to the individual's lifestyle and environment) and endogenous (due to the \"body clock\") components. During exercise, many of the rhythms persist, even though some show decreasing amplitude with increasing severity of exercise. Whilst the value of physical fitness is not disputed (for elite athletes, for individuals who just want to be physically fit, or for patients undertaking physical rehabilitation regimens), there are certain times of the day when special care is needed. These times are soon after waking--when there is the possibility of an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and damage to the spine--and late in the day--when there is an increased risk of respiratory difficulties. Since physical exercise is inextricably linked with thermoregulation, there are special considerations to bear in mind when exercise takes place in cold or hot environments. Further, due to the effects of the body clock, exercise and activity during night work and after time-zone transitions presents problems peculiar to these circumstances. In addition, the menstrual cycle affects physical performance, and these circatrigintan rhythms interact with the circadian ones. Bearing in mind these factors, advice that is based upon knowledge of circadian and circatrigintan rhythms can be given to all those contemplating physical activity. Chronobiologically, there is advantage in undertaking physical activity programmes towards the middle of the waking day and not at times when a sleep or nap has just been taken.",

      "title": "AB0543 Anxiety and depression in chinese patients with primary sjÖgren's syndrome",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Primary Sjögren9s syndrome (pSS) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder characterised by lymphocytic infiltration and exocrine failure of salivary and lacrimal glands, resulting in the classical symptoms of the disease including xerostomia (dry mouth) and keratoconjuctivitis sicca (dry eyes). pSS has the potential to impair both psychological state and the health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). A common mental health problem among adults with pSS is anxiety and depression. In addition, depression is more common in pSS than in the general population and has been associated with enhanced fatigue, reduced health-related quality of life, increased levels of physical disability and increased health care costs. Besides, depressed pSS patients have poorer long-term outcomes, including more complications. Anxiety was more common than depression in pSS. The most affected domains were vitality in the SF-36 and general/physical fatigue in the MFI. Extraglandular systemic involvement was not a major determinant of QoL alteration in patients with pSS. <h3>Objectives</h3> Prevalence of anxiety and depression are high in women with Primary Sjögren9s syndrome (pSS). Our aim was to compare anxiety and depression in pSS patients and healthy controls and evaluate its relationship with the disease activity, sleep and quality of life; as well as to analyze potential determinants of anxiety and depression. <h3>Methods</h3> Sixty-seven patients fulfilling the American-European Consensus Group criteria for pSS (mean age 52.76 years (s.d. 13.16)) and 42 age-matched healthy controls were included. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires, namely Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). In addition, the European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren9s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI); Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) and systemic inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) level) were recorded in patients. Independent samples t-tests, χ2 analyses and logistic regression modeling were used to analyze the data. <h3>Results</h3> pSS patients experienced greater anxiety and depression than controls (HADS-A scores: mean± SD 6.5±3.4 for pSS versus 3.8±3.4 for controls; <i>P</i> =0.002. HADS-D scores: mean± SD 6.7±4.1 for pSS versus 4.2±3.5 for controls; <i>P</i> =0.012). And there were significant correlations among fatigue, pain, disease activity, dryness, sleep, quality of life and anxiety/depression. Meanwhile, logistic regression analysis revealed that poor quality of life and ESSPRI were significantly associated with anxiety/depression in pSS patients. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The study suggests that optimal care of pSS patients may include the detection and management of anxiety and depression. Early recognition and appropriate intervention is therefore essential to reduce the negative impact of anxiety and depression on the patient9s quality of life and outcome of their disease. <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81471603, 81172841); \"Top Six Types of Talents\" Financial Assistance of Jiangsu Province (Grant no. 10.WSN016). <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared",

      "abstract": "The syndrome of pituitary cachexia has been so completely described and the literature concerning it so thoroughly reviewed in the recent American literature by Silver (1) and Calder (2) that a detailed description of it is unnecessary here. The disease, briefly, is characterized by progessive weight loss and cachexia, loss of libido and potentia, falling of axillary and pubic hair, premature menopause, decrease in basal metabolism, trophic changes in the skin and mental torpor with frequent terminal coma accompanied by hyperpyrexia. Eosinophilia and gastrointestinal disturbances with achlorhydria are not uncommon. Women are affected more frequently than men (about 70 per cent of reported cases) and the symptoms often begin insidiously after a prolonged or difficult labor. The course is chronic, sometimes extending over many years. The primary lesion involves the anterior pituitary; it may be due to a nonspecific atrophy or fibrosis, the degenerative phase of an adenoma or other neoplasm, cysts, tuberculosis, syphilis, or trauma. In a few reported cases no definite structural change has been found in the anterior pituitary; in some instances extension of an adjacent mass lesion occurs, as in the case reported by A. Weinstein (3) in which invasion of an ependymal glioma produced the symptoms. On the other hand, extensive destruction of the anterior pituitary may occur without the syndrome of Simmonds disease. Kaminski (4) has recently described such destruction from extension of a chronic actinomycoticosteomyelitis of the malar bone, invading the basal meninges and pituitary fossa, without any evidence of glandular dysfunction except testicular atrophy. Kaminski attempts to differentiate between ‘exogenous’ and ‘endogenous’ types of pituitary dysfunction, believing that the ‘endogenou’ type is more apt to produce the Simmond’s syndrome.",

One symptom which may have been under reported is cognitive impairment. We conducted a retrospective study of 100 patients presenting for evaluation and treatment of posttraumatic headache at our headache clinic. Sixty-five percent reported difficulties with either memory, concentration, and/or thinking. The most common cognitive symptoms reported were concentration+memory problems, concentration + memory + thinking difficulties, concentration disturbances, and difficulty remembering, respectively. Subjects in both groups (with cognitive symptoms and without cognitive symptoms) were similar in age, but females seemed more predisposed than males to cognitive impairment following mild head injury. It is suggested that clinicians thoroughly evaluate patients for cognitive symptoms, particularly when patients have a permanent condition and are subsequently involved in litigation.",

      "abstract": "Most people at times experience physical symptoms such as pain, fatigue or dizziness. Surveys show that approximately 90% of the Dutch general population experienced at least one physical symptom in the past two weeks. While in most cases symptoms disappear spontaneously, in certain cases symptoms persist for a few weeks or even months without having an identifiable underlying explanation. Such Medically Unexplained Physical Symptoms (MUPS) can have a high impact on quality of life and daily functioning, impairing social, physical and psychological functioning. Whether people visit their general practitioner with concerns about these symptoms is strongly related to the impact on daily life and ideas about these symptoms. Developing MUPS is more common when patients are concerned and develop negative catastrophizing beliefs. MUPS can be regarded on a continuum with a spectrum ranging from mild to moderate and then persisting or chronic MUPS. This dissertation focused on patients with moderate MUPS and preventing chronicity in this patient group. The moderate MUPS population has a high prevalence in primary care, yet little research has been done on preventing chronicity. Furthermore, there is not yet an appropriate treatment to reduce the burden for these patients, straining healthcare professionals and incurring high healthcare and societal costs. Given the ambitions to provide the right care, for the right patient, in the right place, at the right time, we find a combination of early identification of patients with moderate MUPS and a preventive intervention integrating eHealth (blended care) a move forward. What lies ahead is to tailor such interventions, rather than offer a one-size-fits-all treatment. Increasing insights into self-management skills and movement behavior during treatment can aid the tailoring of interventions, as can early identification of patients’ needs, motivation, and the requested use of eHealth. As this way of treatment differs from usual care, healthcare professionals should be coached more on their changing role from treating patients to coaching patients.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUÇÃO: A epilepsia traz consigo um risco aumentado de desenvolvimento de distúrbios psiquiátricos. Pacientes com epilepsia parcial têm um risco maior do que aqueles com epilepsia generalizada idiopática. Além disso, a condição crônica das crises parece ser um fator importante no risco aumentado. Os sintomas resultam de mecanismos psicopatológicos muito diversos entre os pacientes. As classificações são baseadas na sintomatologia psiquiátrica, na presença ou ausência de distúrbios da consciência, em anormalidades do EEG e na relação temporal entre os sintomas e as crises. RESULTADOS: Comorbidades psiquiátricas em epilepsia são muito freqüentes, especialmente aquelas que têm o lobo temporal como área epileptogênica principal. As desordens com maior prevalência são os distúrbios de humor como depressão maior, ansiedade e psicose. CONCLUSÃO: A epilepsia do lobo temporal per se, não pode ser considerada um fator de risco para o desenvolvimento de sintomas psiquiátricos, ou mais severos, dentre os pacientes com epilepsia parcial. Fatores concomitantes como duração da epilepsia e freqüência de crises podem ter um papel adicional importante. O reconhecimento mais acurado das comorbidades psiquiátricas poderá ajudar no desenvolvimento e implementação de programas apropriados de diagnóstico e tratamento, assim como melhorar o devir e a qualidade de vida dos pacientes com epilepsia.",

The interviewer should inquire whether the child experiences repeated, severe anger or temper outbursts that are either verbal (verbal rages) or involve physical aggression towards other people or things and for no good reason. The interviewer should also ask the parent whether these outbursts are unexpected or unusual, given their child's age. To meet the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must occur on average three or more times per week, and must be constant for 12 months or more, without a period of 3 months of normal mood. Moreover, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must have started before age 10, but not before age 6.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "title": "Como é o atendimento em Saúde Mental feito pelas Equipes de Saúde da Família do Pará",
      "abstract": "Esta pesquisa tem como objetivo avaliar o atendimento em realizado pelas equipes de da Familia do Estado do Para. Analisando estudos que descrevem praticas de atendimento em saude mental na Atencao Basica, e possivel observar que, entre estes profissionais, ainda ha certa inseguranca em lidar com casos de sofrimento mental. A formacao destes, por ser mais generalista em sua grande maioria, leva a duvidas quanto ao cuidado que deve ser realizado. O que nos leva a constatacao de que estes profissionais precisam de um acompanhamento mais proximo. Nos atendimentos em saude mental na atencao basica, ainda se observa vasta utilizacao de benzodiazepinicos. Os benzodiazepinicos sao medicamentos cujo efeito e ansiolitico e, em muitos casos, amplamente receitado e esta pratica produz a magica de problemas pessoais, socio-afetivos e profissionais, encontrados no medicamento. O uso continuado provoca tolerância (organismo necessita de doses maiores para manutencao de efeitos terapeuticos) e dependencia (recaida dos sintomas quando este e abruptamente suspenso). Outros efeitos sao os deficits cognitivos que tendem a se instalar no curso da utilizacao desses medicamentos. Diante disso, para analisar o atendimento em saude mental na atencao basica do Estado do Para, utilizamos dados coletados atraves do Programa Nacional de Melhoria do Acesso e da Qualidade da Atencao Basica (PMAQ), coletados no  primeiro ciclo do PMAQ (2012/2013),  que gerou um banco de dados de todas as equipes de atencao basica contextualizadas nos termos do programa. Este banco de dados foi inicialmente convertido para um formato de planilha eletronica que foi analisada  no software Microsoft® Office Excel® 2010. Realizou-se uma filtragem destes dados, selecionando as variaveis referentes a atencao a realizadas por estas equipes, que se encontram no questionario de avaliacao profissional (modulo II), do bloco Saude e Atencao ao Usuario com Transtorno Mental (item II.29 do modulo II). Os dados destas variaveis foram transferidos para o software IBM® SPSS® Statistics 20, a fim de realizar uma Estatistica Descritiva com o calculo das frequencias absolutas e relativas destas. Segundo informacoes da Sala de Apoio a Gestao Estrategica do Ministerio da no ano 2014,existem 1149 equipes de da Familia no estado do Para. Deste total, foram analisados os dados de 353 equipes nesta pesquisa. De acordo com nossas analises, 46,7% (n=165) das equipes entrevistas responderam que agendam consultas com pessoas em sofrimento mental em qualquer dia da semana e em qualquer horario. Ja 8,8% (n=31) delas fazem agendamento em qualquer dia da semana, mas em horarios especificos. Os agendamentos em dias especificos fixos em ate tres dias na semana e em dias especificos fixos em mais de tres dias na semana obtiveram 5,9% (n=21) e 1,7% (n=6) de frequencia respectivamente. Outros tipos de agendamentos correspondem a 36,8% (n=130) do total. Apesar de estas informacoes mostrarem que nao ha tantas dificuldades em uma pessoa em sofrimento mental conseguir uma consulta com as equipes, em 64,9% (n=218) das equipes nao ha consulta especifica com maior para este tipo de atendimento. Somente em 34,8% existe este tipo de consulta. Ou seja, poucas equipes oferecem um cuidado que se pretenda mais peculiar, com uma duracao adequada que pode oferecer mais tempo para o vinculo entre usuario e trabalhador da saude, algo essencial para situacoes de saude mental e tambem para o proprio cuidado na estrategia de saude da familia. Em 61,2% (n=216) das Equipes de da Familia,a atencao a saude mental ocorre sem uma insercao de um profissional no campo que lhe de suporte para o atendimento. Somente 35,4% (n=125) conseguem fazer este atendimento comprofissionais especializados na area. Apesar de poucas equipes oferecerem atendimento com profissionais qualificados para atencao em Mental, 76,5% (n=270) afirmam receber apoio ou auxilio de profissionais para a resolucao de casos mais complexos, sejam eles vindos dos NASF ou do CAPS locais. As equipes, em sua maioria, nao possuem registros dos atendimentos voltados para a atencao a saude mental. 59,5% das equipes dizem nao possuir qualquer registro do numero dos casos mais graves de usuarios em sofrimento mental, contra 35,4% que possui estes dados. Em 83% das equipes nao ha registro dos usuarios com necessidade decorrente do uso de crack, alcool e outras drogas, contra somente 13,6% que possuem. Ja a respeito do registro de usuarios que estao em uso cronico de benzodiazepinicos, 30,3% dizem possuir estes dados, ao passo que 67,1% nao possuem. Ha tambem poucas equipes fazendo promocao de saude com prevencao e tratamento ao uso, abuso e dependencia decorrentes do uso de crack, alcool e outras drogas. Apenas 20,4% relatam fazer tal acao. Da mesma forma, apenas 7,6%  fazem acoes de promocao de saude com prevencao e tratamento ao uso, abuso e dependencia de ansioliticos e benzodiazepinicos, como referido anteriormente. Este e um acontecimento que possivelmente tem relacao com a baixa qualificacao das equipes no atendimento em saude mental. O atendimento a situacoes de saude mental realizado pelas Equipes de da Familia que avaliamos no estado do Para mostra-se ainda insuficiente. E importante potencializar ainda mais o apoio matricial e ampliar a formacao e qualificacao dos trabalhadores e trabalhadoras para que possam acolher de forma mais adequada os usuarios que demandem atencao no campo da saude mental.  Apesar de boa parte das equipes receberem apoio de profissionais especializados, e preciso qualificar o trabalho em direcao a promocao e prevencao, nao somente ao atendimento da demanda espontânea. E preciso se criar uma cultura de fazer registros dos atendimentos, pois estes sao de extrema importância principalmente para a continuidade do cuidado, que e um dos cernes da Estrategia da Familia. Dar visibilidade ao problema e essencial para criar novos dispositivos de atencao que acolham de forma mais adequada os usuarios.  Por exemplo, se a maioria nao possui registro dos seus casos mais graves, ou tambem dos casos de pessoas que possuem necessidade de uso de substâncias psicoativas, ha umacompanhamento inadequado dos casos centrado na medicalizacao e afastando-se da perspectiva de cuidado integral, ou sequer, encaminhando de forma adequada os usuarios no sistema de referencia e contra-referencia preconizado pelo SUS. E preciso investir em um cuidado mais demorado, menos engolido pela pressao da demanda espontânea.  Mas, para isso, o Estado do Para necessita aumentar a cobertura das equipes de saude da familia e da atencao basica, que hoje  cobre um pouco  mais da metade (51,15%) da populacao paraense. Incentivos  estaduais como o reforco ao Piso de Atencao Basica,  baseados em indicadores e anteriormente pagos pelo governo estadual, precisam voltar a ser efetivos, ja que os municipios sao os entes da federacao que mais gastam percentualmente o seu orcamento com a politica de saude.  Por fim, ha a necessidade tambem de mais profissionais especializados em saude mental, especialmente de medicos psiquiatras e equipes qualificadas para dar atencao aos usuarios.  Sem trabalhadores e trabalhadores que compreendam a importância e estejam preparados para entender as demandas desse campo nao ha como avancar e superar os desafios postos neste artigo.  Um dos maiores bem dos servicos de saude sao os seus trabalhadores e trabalhadoras.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Body The risk of mothers to develop a severe mental illness is dramatically increased in the first three months after giving birth. Childbirth has the strongest relationship with postpartum affective psychosis, a condition that is characterized by an acute onset of florid symptoms, usually within 2 weeks of delivery, and atypical features, such as rapidly fluctuating psychotic symptoms, florid motor symptoms, perplexity and high risks to the mother and her baby. Follow up data of women with a first episode suggest that some women only become ill in the context of childbirth whereas in others it is an expression of a lifelong bipolar disorder. Whether this reflects two distinct forms of the disorder or different degrees of vulnerability requires future study. The profound hormonal and metabolic as well as psychosocial changes in the perinatal period give rise to a number of hypotheses that seek to explain the pathogenesis of postpartum psychosis. Current research findings on biological and psychosocial risk factors will be discussed as well as what is currently known about responses to treatment. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Regular physical activity improves quality of life, cognitive functions, mood state and physical capacity, and lowers the risk of many diseases and premature death. Physical activity affects proteins and gene expression through signalling mechanisms, e.g. epigenetic changes. The biological response to physical activity can be markedly different between individuals, to a large degree due to genetic mechanisms. Regular aerobic physical activity (endurance training) improves cardiac function, partly due to an increased stroke volume, and lowers blood pressure due to e.g. improved vasodilation, lower arterial stiffness and increased capillarisation. Regular physical activity helps to maintain muscle mass and function and can improve brain health and function, e.g. executive and memory functions.",

Asthenia is perceived as an unpleasant sensation whenever it exceeds one’s physiological resources, such as rest that must be recuperated.

      "title": "Sleep and circadian difficulties in schizophrenia: presentations, understanding, and treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract It is common in mental health care to ask about people’s days but comparatively rare to ask about their nights. Most patients diagnosed with schizophrenia struggle at nighttime. The next-day effects can include a worsening of psychotic experiences, affective disturbances, and inactivity, which in turn affect the next night’s sleep. Objective and subjective cognitive abilities may be affected too. Patients commonly experience a mix of sleep difficulties in a night and across a week. These difficulties include trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping at all; nightmares and other awakenings; poor-quality sleep; oversleeping; tiredness; sleeping at the wrong times; and problems establishing a regular sleep pattern. The patient group is also more vulnerable to obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. We describe in this article how the complex presentation of non-respiratory sleep difficulties arises from variation across five factors: timing, mental state, need for sleep, self-care, and environment. We set out 10 illustrative patterns of such difficulties experienced by patients with non-affective psychosis. These sleep problems are eminently treatable with intensive psychological therapy delivered over approximately eight sessions. We describe key techniques and their typical order of implementation by presentation. Sleep problems are an important issue for patients. Giving them the therapeutic attention patients often desire brings both real clinical benefits and improves views of services. Treatment is also very likely to lessen psychotic experiences and mood disturbances while improving daytime functioning and quality of life. Tackling sleep difficulties can be a route toward the successful treatment of psychosis.",

      "title": "Suicidal ideation in older people, a public health matter",
      "abstract": "Introduction Suicide in older people is a critical public and mental health issue which requires attention, given that the ageing population is increasing. Multiple factors, including biological, psychological, and social stressors increase suicidal susceptibility. Unfortunately, elderly are more susceptible to these, such as psychiatric disturbances, physical comorbidities, prior suicide-related behaviours, lack of social support, grief, and increased difficulty in problem-solving Objectives In order to review the risk and protective factors, assessment and prevention of suicide in older adults. Methods Bibliographic research through PubMed and Web of Science. Results Older people can be subdivided into three age groups (from “young old” at 65 years old to “oldest old” after 85 years of age), with suicide being more prevalent in the oldest-old, and overall in men above 75 years old. Previous psychiatric background, suicidal attempts, substance abuse, poor physical health or disability, family psychiatric history, low social support or isolation, and finantial stress most frequently predispose to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts or death by suicide in this community. Besides this, ageing relates to a tendency to cognitive impairment, which affects coping mechanisms, leading to deficits in reasoning and decision-making under stressful circumstances during depressive episodes. This can mediate suicidal ideation and associates to greater lethality methods. Geriatric suicidal attempters have been shown to have greater degrees of cortical and subcortical cerebral areas, including the frontal, parietal and temporal regions, as well as significant loss of volume in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, insula, midbrain, cerebellum, lentiform nucleus and putamen. Abnormalities in these regions can impair executive and cognitive function, attention, problem solving and ultimately be responsible for suicidal behaviour. On the other hand, there are suicide protective elements such as physical and cognitive fitness, quality of life and life satisfaction, marital status, religiousness and social support. A prompt identification of modifiable risk factors and strengthening the protective ones by health professionals can reduce this prospect. Conclusions Suicidal ideation in older people is a multifactorial public health concern given the very high frequency of completed suicides in this population. Therefore, it is urgent to review and further research to build more effective suicide prevention strategies. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "La comorbidité psychiatrique est la règle plutôt que l’exception dans le cadre de la dépression majeure. 60 à 70 % des patients déprimés présentent au moins une comorbidité psychiatrique, et 30 à 40 % en ont au moins deux. Les comorbidités les plus fréquemment retrouvées sont les pathologies anxieuses, les addictions, et certains troubles ou traits de personnalité (borderline, neuroticisme) [1]. La présence de telles comorbidités compromet le pronostic de la maladie dépressive, avec une diminution des taux de rémission et de réponse aux traitements, un allongement du délai d’action, un tableau clinique plus sévère, une altération du fonctionnement et une chronicisation. Les comorbidités psychiatriques sont considérées comme un des facteurs participant à la résistance thérapeutique pour 20 à 30 % des épisodes [2]. Cette absence de réponse pourrait être plus particulièrement associée à certains sous-types et phénotypes cliniques de dépression poussant alors à la recherche de biomarqueurs spécifiques (électrophysiologiques, anatomiques et fonctionnels, métaboliques, et génétiques) de chacune de ces formes cliniques afin d’améliorer la compréhension même de la pathologie et son pronostic [3]. Par ailleurs, les recommandations ne définissent pas de stratégies précises en cas de dépressions avec comorbidités psychiatriques, les études randomisées, contrôlées classiquement menées ayant généralement tendance à exclure ces patients, et notamment ceux présentant une addiction associée. Il est néanmoins possible que le traitement de la dépression puisse améliorer le trouble comorbide, comme en témoigne la place aujourd’hui occupée par les antidépresseurs dans la pharmacothérapie des troubles anxieux [4]. Ces données soulèvent des questions cliniques, thérapeutiques et de recherche importantes, centrées sur une meilleure identification des facteurs de risque de la résistance en abordant le problème central de la comorbidité psychiatrique qu’il est essentiel de repérer dans le cadre d’une prise en charge globale du patient déprimé.",

      "title": "Minor Depression and 'Subthreshold' Anxiety Symptoms in Older Adults: Psychosocial Therapies and Special Considerations",
      "abstract": "GENERATIONS A new focus on these common causes of distress and impairment. In recent years more attention has been given to identifying and treating mental disorders in older adults. By and large, these efforts have focused on disorders delineated in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Sta/Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). However, another class of disorders is also beginning to receive attention: mental disorders. Although these sets of symptoms do not meet the full criteria to be classified as specific mental disorders, they are nonetheless associated with clinically significant distress or impairment (Pincus, Davis, and McQueen,1999). In this article we will discuss two specific conditions, and subthreshold generalized anxiety disorder, and the evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial therapies for these conditions for older adults. MINOR DEPRESSION Minor depression is typically defined as the presence of at least two but fewer than five depressive symptoms, including depressed mood or loss of interest in normal daily activities, during the same two-week period with no history of major depressive episode or dysthymic disorder but with clinically significant impairment or distress (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Minor depression is highly prevalent in older adults in the community (9.9 percent) (Hybels, Blazer, and Pieper, 2001) and in primary care (5.2 percent) (Lyness et al., 1999). In mixed-age samples minor depression has been shown to be associated with levels of functional impairment comparable to those caused by medical illnesses (Wells et al., 1992) and with increased expenditures on medical care (Johnson, Weissman, and Klerman, 1992). Morbidity has been less extensively studied in samples of older adults, but the morbidity rates of elders with minor depression may be assumed to be at least comparable to samples with medical illnesses given the higher prevalence of complicating medical conditions. A recent study has shown minor depression to be associated with an increased risk for mortality in older men (Penninx et al., 1999). Although assessment of the prevalence of minor depression in racial and ethnic minority populations tends to be clouded by linguistic and cultural differences in expressing affective and somatic symptoms, recent research taking into account these measurement challenges indicates that minor depression is very common in older ethnic minorities in primary care. According to Arean and Alvidrez (2001), as many as io percent of older African Americans, 15 percent of older Latinos, and 12 percent of older Asians meet criteria for minor depression. SCREENING FOR MINOR DEPRESSION One of the most common instruments for screening and tracking depression in primary care is the Patient Health Questionnaire Nine-- Item Depression Module (PHQ-9). The patient fills out the questionnaire, and the information can yield a diagnosis of major or minor depression. While psychometric studies have yet to be done on the utility of the PHQ-9 with minority elders, the instrument is available in Spanish and Chinese. PSYCHOSOCIAL THERAPIES FOR MINOR DEPRESSION Empirically derived treatment guidelines have been established for major depression. However, a paucity of studies, which have yielded conflicting findings, means that no specific guidelines are currently available for pharmacologic or psychosocial treatment of minor depression. Psychosocial therapies are particularly appealing for older adults because they often have medical conditions as well, leading to an increased possibility of adverse drug interactions. Since the research on treating minor depression in older adults is so limited, we will review the evidence for psychosocial treatments of minor depression in both younger and older adults together. The interventions examined include cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal, and problem-solving therapy, as well as physical exercise. …",

      "title": "Some Remarks About Somato-Psychic Compared to Psychosomatic Relationships",
      "abstract": "Somato-psychic medicine refers to all those processes in which psychological phenomena are produced by alterations of the body's anatomy or physiology. It is often extremely difficult to determine the first cause of a psychic disturbance, since somatic influences may produce psychic phenomena, and these in turn may produce somatic processes, and vice versa. These relationships are graphically portrayed for a few well-known clinical pictures. At times it is possible, by analysis of the manifestations presented, to discover evidence of the various influences. Under certain conditions, however, a later process may exert such overwhelming effects in the temporal succession of events that the influence of earlier factors may not be manifest in the clinical picture. A simple classification of the various somato-psychic influences in three groups is presented for better visualization. The first group is comprised of processes taking place within the confines of the skull. The second is represented by those disease processes that are anatomically located extracranially but where changed metabolites or other agents exert influence on the brain cells with subsequent psychic signs. Drugs and other substances brought from outside into the body and exerting influence on the brain may be regarded as a subgroup of factors belonging to this second group. The third group comprises psychic processes that represent conscious or unconscious reactions by the individuals to somatic diseases or to permanent bodily conditions. The correlation of somatic abnormalities and psychological disturbance is, of course, not exhausted by psychosomatic and somato-psychic relationships, since a certain body build and a particular psychological make-up may be expressions of the same constitution.",

The nervous tension, caused by the irritating atmosphere of great cities, is obviously conducive to psycho-neurotic troubles; and, if a rigorist educative influence saddles a hypersensitive temperament afflicted by these troubles, with the result that religion is misconceived as a repressive legalism, the effect will almost inevitably be a false conscience perhaps for ever paralysed by scruples. Whenever it makes its appearance and for the same reasons, this disease either suddenly breaks out in a violent crisis or gradually spreads in a slow, consuming progression. Much has been written about this malady : descriptions of the disorder, descriptions of the supernatural trial, the attitude to be taken towards the scrupulous by confessor and director, psychotherapeutic treatments or others in obstinate and disconcerting cases. It would seem that nothing has been overlooked and that the subject is therefore exhausted. One is tempted to conclude : the whole question has been settled once and for all. Nevertheless the scrupulous remain. It is in the West among Latins that scrupulosity is found in its endemic state, whereas it is unknown among Eastern Catholics and Orthodox . . .’",

      "title": "Impact of Shift Work on Health: A Review",
      "abstract": "In modern society, more and more people work during ‘non-standard’ working hours, including shift and night work, which are recognized risk factors for health, safety and social well-being. Unfortunately, humans are physiologically unsuited to inverted schedules, leading to negative consequences for shift workers, employers, and society. The circadian and homeostatic processes which govern sleepiness and alertness are improperly aligned for night workers. Shiftwork, in particular night work, causes disruption of biological rhythms, perturbation of social and family life, with a negative influence on performance efficiency and health. Deterioration of health can manifest in the short-term as sleep disorders and accidents; in the long term there is an increased risk of gastrointestinal, psychoneurotic and cardiovascular diseases, and impairment of the female reproductive function. Night work and rotating shift work disrupt the circadian timing system. This disruption may produce significant deleterious symptoms ¡n some workers. Shift-work scheduling may aggravate certain medical conditions. Vulnerable individuals may develop clinical depression when working shifts.",

      "title": "Long-term Cognitive and Functional Impairments After Critical Illness",
      "abstract": "As critical illness survivorship increases, patients and health care providers are faced with management of long-term sequelae including cognitive and functional impairment. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated impairments persisting at least 1–5 years after hospitalization for critical illness. Cognitive domains impacted include memory, attention, and processing speed. Functional impairments include physical weakness, reduced endurance, and dependence on others for basic tasks of daily living such as bathing or feeding. In characterizing the trajectory of long-term recovery, multiple risk factors have been identified for subsequent impairment, including increased severity of illness and severe sepsis, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and delirium. Preadmission status including frailty, high level of preexisting comorbidities, and baseline cognitive dysfunction are also associated with impairment after critical illness. Development of cognitive and functional impairment is likely multifactorial, and multiple mechanistic theories have been proposed. Neuroinflammation, disruption of the blood–brain barrier, and structural alterations in the brain have all been observed in patients with long-term cognitive dysfunction. Systemic inflammation has also been associated with alterations in muscle integrity and function, which is associated with intensive care unit–acquired weakness and prolonged functional impairment. Efforts to ease the burden of long-term impairments include prevention strategies and rehabilitation interventions after discharge. Delirium is a well-established risk factor for long-term cognitive dysfunction, and using delirium-prevention strategies may be important for cognitive protection. Current evidence favors minimizing overall sedation exposure, careful selection of sedation agents including avoidance of benzodiazepines, and targeted sedation goals to avoid oversedation. Daily awakening and spontaneous breathing trials and early mobilization have shown benefit in both cognitive and functional outcomes. Multifactorial prevention bundles are useful tools in improving care provided to patients in the intensive care unit. Data regarding cognitive rehabilitation are limited, while studies on functional rehabilitation have conflicting results. Continued investigation and implementation of prevention strategies and rehabilitation interventions will hopefully improve the quality of life for the ever-increasing population of critical illness survivors.",

      "title": "Sleep and Quality of Life in Headache and Migraine",
      "abstract": "Headache and sleep disorders are prevalent, comorbid conditions that challenge physical as well as psychosocial well-being. Headache is the most common pain-related complaint and the seventh leading ailment seen in medical practice, accounting for 18 million physician visits annually in the USA alone (1). Though historically headache often has been trivialized (perhaps because pain is not easily quantified and headache does not generally compromise life expectancy), headache is in a major quality of life (QOL) concern. In fact, migraine headache is among the 20 leading causes of \"years lived with disability\" according the World Health Report (2). The burden of headache is increasingly appreciated in psychological, family and interpersonal, vocational, and economic realms. Headache, particularly in its more chronic and severe forms, has been linked to sleep disorders. Interestingly, the sleep disorders associated with headache are varied in nature, including obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder, circadian rhythm disorder, insomnia, and hypersomnia. General symptom patterns, particularly morning headache and chronic daily headache, are suggestive of and aid in recognition of a sleep disorder. Management of the sleep disorder may improve or resolve the headache; sleep-disordered breathing is the most empirically supported example of this relationship. Although pure sleep-related headaches, such as hypoxemia-related headache, are less prevalent and more easily recognized, primary headaches as well are often impacted to some degree by sleep. Irrespective of sleep disorders, variation in the sleep/wake schedule is one of the most common acute headache precipitants while sleeping is one of the most common palliative responses to headache. Insomnia is the sleep disorder most often cited by clinical headache populations. Despite an emerging literature supporting the interdependence of sleep and headache, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains speculative. Few well-controlled studies are available, and it is difficult to generalize results across sleep and headache literatures due to inconsistencies in diagnostic nosologies, lack of standardized outcome measures, and varied populations. Future research with improved methods is needed to identify mediating factors between sleep and headache. This chapter reviews the co-morbidity of headache and sleep disorders, prevalence, diagnostic considerations, societal and individual burden of headache, clinical implications, and considerations for future directions.",

      "abstract": "1. IntroductionA lot many factors are available which contribute to this avoidable adventure. Out of these few which are highly relevant have been lineated as follows. Familial : This could be an important cause as individuals from families with a history of any kind of addiction are more likely to develop addiction.. The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

      "abstract": "Psychogenic or functional movement disorders (PMDs) may occur at almost any age, particularly those affecting vulnerable populations. Mostly, that are not explained by an specifiable organic disease and that especially related to psychiatric underlying cause. Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

      "abstract": "We live in times of deadlines and information overload. Many individuals are mentally and emotionally overextended with conscious - or subconscious - feelings of apprehension and worry chronically present. The increased heart rate associated with certain psychological states and disorders has, until recently, primarily been ascribed to increases in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. However, it is now accepted that decreases in parasympathetic control, that is, decreases in the autonomic 'brake' on heart rate, are much more important than previously assumed. Perhaps of greater concern with regard to anxiety disorders are indications of an autonomic inflexibility or decreased responsiveness in the face of a challenge. In view of the importance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to instantaneously regulate many functions in line with mental and physical needs, lower responsiveness could have a significant influence on physical and psychological well-being. The question is whether anxiety, within the normative range, has an impact on resting ANS functioning and on the ANS responses to moderate everyday challenges.",
