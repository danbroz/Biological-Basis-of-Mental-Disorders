    "title": "Self-Efficacy and Emotional Competence of Learning Disability Students:A Correlational Analysis",
    "abstract": "Unlike other disabilities, such as paralysis or blindness, a learning disability is a hidden handicapped and it is a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to receive, process, store and respond to information. The term learning disability is used to describe the seeming unexplained difficulty a person of at least average intelligence has in acquiring basic academic skills. These skills are essential for success at school and work and for coping with life in general. An important part of the definition of Learning Disability is its exclusions: learning disabilities cannot be attributed primarily to mental retardation, emotional disturbance, cultural difference, or disadvantage. Thus, the concept of Learning Disability focuses on the notion of a discrepancy between a child's academic achievement and his orher apparent capacity to learn. Learning Dis abilities affects individuals differently at various stages of life-early childhood, the elementary schools years, adolescence, and adulthood. In some cases other problems coexist with the learning disabilities. Emotional competence as an efficiency to deal effectively with several dissociable but related processes is a blending of competencies (Coleman 1970). A learned capability' based on emotional intelligence that results in outstanding performance at work. Our emotional intelligence determines our potential for learning the practical skills based on the five elements: self-awareness, motivation, self-regulation, empathy, and adeptness in relationships. Our emotional competence shows how much of that potential we have translated into on-the-job capabilities. (Denial Goleman, 1998). Emotional competence can be defined as the demonstration or practical application of the learned abilities and knowledge-building attitudes related to the cognitive, affective, conative and social aspects of emotional intelligence in active interaction with one's environment. Emotional competence can be a resource through which organisational relationships are created, interpreted and altered but self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in his or her capacity to execute behaviours necessary to produce specific performance attainments (Bandura, 1977,1986,1997). Self-efficacy reflects confidence in the ability to exert control over one's own motivation, behavior, and social environment. Self-efficacy is the extent or strength of one's belief in one's own ability to complete tasks and reach goals. Self-efficacy affects every area of human endeavor. By determining the beliefs a person holds regarding his or her power to affect situations, it strongly influences both the power a person actually has to face challenges competently andthe choices a person is most likely to make.Jadhav (2010) investigated a study on a study of emotional maturity' and emotional competence of college going students of Belgaum district and reported that there is a significant difference between male and female students, second year students and government and private college students in emotional competence. It was found that there is no difference between 20-21 and 22-23 year students in both variables, male and female and first and second year students in emotional maturity and arts and science students in both emotional maturity andemotional competence, rural and urban students in emotional competence.Pintrich and Groot (1990) observed in one study on Motivational and self-regulated learning components of classroom academic performance and results revealed that, depending on the outcome measure, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and test anxiety emerged as the best predictors of performance. Intrinsic value did not have a direct influence on performance but was strongly related to self-regulation and cognitive strategy use, regardless of prior achievement level. Levine (1999) reported that children who cannot overcome learning difficulties are more likely to under-perform in school and become problem students. …",

    "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility (CF) enables individuals to readily shift from one concept or mode of practice/thoughts to another in response to changes in the environment and feedback, making CF vital to optimise success in obtaining goals. However, how CF relates to other executive functions (e.g., working memory, response inhibition), mental abilities (e.g., creativity, literacy, numeracy, intelligence, structure learning), and social factors (e.g., multilingualism, tolerance of uncertainty, perceived social support, social decision-making) is less well understood. The current study aims to (1) establish the construct validity of CF in relation to other executive function skills and intelligence, and (2) elucidate specific relationships between CF, structure learning, creativity, career decision making and planning, and other life skills.",

    "abstract": "Psychological problems of intelligence and intellectual development are considered in the context of designing of experimental distance learning course of personal development “Success”. The research shows that highly developed intelligence is related to the process of life success achievement. General metacognitions (reflection, strategic thinking, decentration) and unassisted problem statement are shown to be sufficient for integration of different types of intelligence – academic, practical, social, emotional – and for their discrimination from other psychic constructs. Forming of these intellectual metacognitions is included in the distance learning course for development of competencies of success. In order to give learning developmental potential, ability to promote transforming of information into knowledge and means for problem solving, a unit of development (self-development) should be designed and put into operation. Key words : intelligence; intellectual development; reflection; decentration; distance learning. * * * * * Download/read",

    "title": "Executive Functioning During Infancy and Childhood",
    "abstract": "Introduction Executive functions refer to a set of cognitive processes that support the regulation of thoughts, emotions and behaviours. Executive functions help us to achieve goals in our daily lives, whether planning a vacation, controlling anger or multi-tasking. They develop dramatically during infancy and childhood, and predict later success in school, health and income. They are also trainable under certain conditions. At the same time, executive functions are highly heritable, meaning that genetic differences between individuals contribute to differences between individuals in executive functions. Moreover, these differences are stable across development: Low executive functioning in childhood predicts low executive functioning decades later. Impairments in executive functions are observed in children from backgrounds of low socioeconomic status and in a variety of clinical disorders, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, autism and depression.",

    "abstract": "Creativity tests measure specific cognitive processes such as thinking divergently, making associations, constructing and combining broad categories, or working on many ideas simultaneously. They also measure noncognitive aspects of creativity such as motivation (e.g., impulse expression, desire for novelty, risk‐taking), and facilitatory personal properties like flexibility, tolerance for independence, or positive attitudes to differentness. Raters can score the various kinds of test with substantial levels of agreement, while scores are internally stable to an acceptable degree. The tests also correlate to a reasonable degree with various criteria of creativity such as teacher ratings, and are useful predictors of adult behavior. Thus, they are useful in both research and education. However, they are best thought of as measures of creative potential because creative achievement depends on additional factors not measured by creativity tests, such as technical skill, knowledge of a field, mental health, or even opportunity. However, the multidimensional creativity concept they define indicates that assessments should be based on several tests, rather than relying on a single score.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety is a normal human emotion that has origins as a useful survival response to dangers in the world. Anxiety and fear are adaptive and defensive reactions to escape the source of danger or motivational conflict. These reactions include active responses to escape the threat, which have been labeled as fight or flight, and passive responses, labeled freeze, when the threat appears inescapable. Individual differences in genetic predisposition and early adverse experiences, as well as coping or affective styles, appear to be critical predisposing factors for anxiety-related disorders. Separation anxiety is a common precursor to school refusal and also may interfere with a child's ability to enter a classroom experience. This chapter operationally defines twice exceptionality as: students who demonstrate the potential for high achievement or creative productivity in one or more domains such as math, science, technology, the social arts, visual, spatial, or performing arts or other areas of human productivity.",

    "title": "Social Skills and Problem‐Solving Training",
    "abstract": "Abstract Social skills training is an approach to improving interpersonal functioning, based on the principles of social learning theory and the shaping of behavior through successive approximations to the desired goal. The primary emphasis in social skills training is on the clinician's use of modeling (demonstrating) specific social skills in simulated role plays, behavioral rehearsal of the targeted skills by the client in role plays, providing positive and corrective feedback following each role play to shape more effective skills, and developing home assignments for clients to practice the skills on their own. Problem‐solving training is teaching an approach to solving personal or interpersonal problems by following a standard sequence of steps: defining the problem, brainstorming solutions, evaluating the solutions, choosing the best solution(s), making a plan to implement the solution(s), and evaluating the success of the solution(s). Social skills and problem‐solving training are conducted together, and may be either the primary focus of group or individual intervention, or combined with other therapeutic techniques. These skills training methods have a strong evidence base supporting their effectiveness in a wide range of child, adolescent, and adult disorders, including developmental disorders (e.g., autism), schizophrenia, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. These skills training approaches are also widely used in health and mental health prevention programs, improving relationships in the general population, and teaching employees effective interpersonal skills.",

    "abstract": "Overview The principles of coaching and reinforcement will be discussed along with case examples of the application of reinforcement, coaching skills and graded exposure for social skills and assertiveness deficits. Clinical examples demonstrating the distinction and overlap between social anxiety disorder and poor social skills will be described. Anger and poor impulse control will be examined, as will comorbidity and overlap with other treatments. A lack of social skills may be present from childhood or only become apparent later in life. Social skills deficit may arise in response to a mental health problem such as schizophrenia or may lead to psychiatric problems in their own right. Indeed, many people may have poor social skills, which interferes with their ability to sustain relationships, succeed in the workplace and live fulfilling lives. Failure in these domains can result in psychological distress and mental health problems. Situations and conditions that can result in impaired social skills include: • lack of general social skills • social anxiety disorder (social phobia) • social skills not developed (e.g. owing to being brought up in a different culture and lack of understanding of the social norms in the new culture) • secondary to a developmental disorder (e.g. Asperger syndrome or autism spectrum disorder) • secondary to severe, enduring mental illness and subsequent withdrawal and negative symptoms (e.g. secondary to schizophrenia) • lack of assertiveness • this can lead to a build up of resentment and eventually may result in psychiatric difficulties such as depression • lack of impulse control • can be comorbid with other psychiatric disorders (e.g. alcohol or drug misuse, personality disorder) • can be a standalone condition and part of a generally impulsive personality. Michel Hersen was one of the most powerful figures in the development of social skills and assertiveness training in the 1970s and 1980s. Although much of this work is now forgotten, many of the skills developed from this time are used in a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings (Miller, 2012; Thase, 2012). Social skills training techniques are part of packages used to treat patients with psychotic illnesses and depression (Bellack, 2004). They are also now widely used in the fields of autism and Asperger syndrome (Patrick, 2008; Weiss et al , 2013; Chang et al , 2014).",

Management might include educational interventions, counseling, cognitive behavior therapy, behavior modification, and pharmacotherapy. Management should always include demystification, construction of a functional profile, specific advice-giving, encouragement, advocacy, and long-term follow-up, roles for which the pediatrician is especially qualified. With increased awareness of the plight of adolescents with attention deficits, the pediatrician, working closely with other professionals, has an extraordinary opportunity to minimize the accusations, suffering, and maladaptive, self-destructive behaviors that have been so much a part of the adolescent9s condition in the past. As we become more sensitive to the effects of endogenous dysfunction during adolescence, it will become increasingly possible to redeem the struggling young people in their own eyes and in the eyes of important adults in their lives. Optimal evaluation and treatment is likely to be taxing, time-consuming, and expensive for all involved. However, the price of neglect, false attributions, and failure will be far higher.",

    "title": "An Integrative Review on the Research Progress of Mindfulness and Its Implications at the Workplace",
    "abstract": "Mindfulness has rapidly become a significant subject area in many disciplines. Most of the work on mindfulness has focused on the perspective of health and healthcare professionals, but relatively less research is focused on the organizational outcomes at the workplace. This review presents a theoretical and practical trajectory of mindfulness by sequential integration of recent fragmented scholarly work on mindfulness at the workplace. The review showcases that most contemporary practical challenges in organizations, such as anxiety, stress, depression, creativity, motivation, leadership, relationships, teamwork, burnout, engagement, performance, well-being, and physical and psychological health, could be addressed successfully with the budding concept of mindfulness. The causative processes due to higher mindfulness that generate positive cognitive, emotional, physiological, and behavioral outcomes include focused attention, present moment awareness, non-judgmental acceptance, self-regulatory functions, lower mind wandering, lower habit automaticity, and self-determination. Employee mindfulness could be developed through various mindfulness interventions in order to improve different organizational requirements, such as psychological capital, emotional intelligence, prosocial behavior, in-role and extra-role performance, financial and economic performance, green performance, and well-being. Accordingly, this review would be beneficial to inspire academia and practitioners on the transformative potential of mindfulness in organizations for higher performance, well-being, and sustainability. Future research opportunities and directions to be addressed are also discussed.",

Management should always include demystification, construction of a functional profile, specific advice-giving, encouragement, advocacy, and long-term follow-up, roles for which the pediatrician is especially qualified. With increased awareness of the plight of adolescents with attention deficits, the pediatrician, working closely with other professionals, has an extraordinary opportunity to minimize the accusations, suffering, and maladaptive, self-destructive behaviors that have been so much a part of the adolescent's condition in the past. As we become more sensitive to the effects of endogenous dysfunction during adolescence, it will become increasingly possible to redeem the struggling young people in their own eyes and in the eyes of important adults in their lives. Optimal evaluation and treatment is likely to be taxing, time-consuming, and expensive for all involved. However, the price of neglect, false attributions, and failure will be far higher.",

    "title": "Development of educators’ soft skills: tolerance to uncertainty and thinking in conditions of instability",
    "abstract": "Based on the analysis of scientific, pedagogical and regulatory sources, it is summarised that the concept of uncertainty is considered in different contexts and meanings. Tolerance for uncertainty and thinking in conditions of instability as part of the “soft skills” of educators, which, along with other skills, underlies their professional effectiveness, adaptation to life situations, remains relevant for researchers. Properties that are important for pedagogical activity are highlighted, which indicate tolerance to uncertainty: the ability to control oneself and not fall into a prolonged state of stress, psychophysical stability, anti-fragility; the ability to master emotions, to control or regulate one’s emotional states; cognitive attitudes that approve, positively colour what is incomprehensible, multitasking, non-linear or multiple; a positive attitude towards situations in which one needs to act, take responsibility, and find solutions. It also deals with intolerance to uncertainty – various negative feelings – discomfort, threat, insecurity, mistrust of oneself and others; giving preference to cognitive strategies in order to simplify situations – stereotyping, polarisation, rushing decisions, finding ways to delegate responsibility, the need for categorisation, dichotomy of thinking, which prompts to automatically give priority to one's own, familiar and usual. Factors that are the conditions and characteristics of instability in professional pedagogical activity have been identified and analysed: poly-subjectivity of educational processes; verticality of the structure of pedagogical interaction; the dynamics of educational changes and educational processes, which is particularly typical of the modern global educational space; external determinism of education by market and social factors. Based on the results of the empirical research (diagnosis of intolerance by Badner), it was found out that: 1. A significant advantage of the average level of intolerance/tolerance of the respondents was found in relation to the subscales: “novelty of the problem” – 73.91 %; “complexity of the problem” – 91.30; “insolvability of the problem” – 84.05; 2. Tolerance, that is, the low level of intolerance of the interviewees is insignificant: “insolvability of the problem” – 7.24 %; “complexity of the problem” – 1.44; “novelty of the problem” – 2.8; 3. As for the high level of intolerance, it was found that it is characteristic of a significant part of future teachers only according to the subscale “novelty of the problem” – 34.78 % – in the respondents of the Preschool Education specialty, and 17.39 % – of the Primary Education specialty. According to the “complexity of the problem” subscale, these indicators are much lower: 8.69 % and 6.52 %, respectively, and according to the “insolvability of the problem” subscale, they are 13.4 % and 6.52 %. Thus, the novelty of the problem is the main source of intolerance to uncertainty and thinking of students in conditions of stability. Keywords: soft skills; pedagogical activity; professional activity in conditions of instability; thinking in conditions of instability; tolerance to uncertainty.",

The basic understanding of science that should be possessed by everyone, not only professionals in scientific fields are frequently referred to as scientific literacy. Intellectual intelligence helps us to understand and navigate the world on one level, but emotional intelligence helps to succeed in life. That is why some people that are academically brilliant are socially inept and unsuccessful. In addition to being emotionally intelligent and scientifically literate, successful living entails ability to tackle problems. Emotional intelligence is directly linked to self-esteem, self-awareness, compassion, empathy and adaptability which are important predictors of success in life.

    "abstract": "'Quality of life' has different meanings and entails different components, depending on the perspective of the investigator and the intention of any analysis. Although there is no exact definition of quality of life, there is an emerging consensus that quality-of-life assessment can be based on physical condition, psychological wellbeing, social activity, and everyday activity. These categories can then be further subdivided into a number of aspects such as mobility, self- care, family contact, intimacy, or negativity in terms of depression or anxiety. The approach to quality of life, therefore, must be multidimensional and involve a variety of investigatory tools (Table 1). The usefulness of many trials dealing with quality of life is limited by their unidimensional approach focusing only on restricted issues, e.g., functional status, excluding mental or psychological aspects or psychological features, leaving aside functional capacity. Future investigations of quality of life, moreover, will have to address a variety of health-associated sectors, including costs, working capacity, and social care, in addition to physical and mental integrity, since invasive therapies cause manifold interactions between the individual and the environment and vice versa. Quality-of-life research should, therefore, use an analytic model and comprehensively include predictors and response variables in a given time-frame in which the impact of therapy on quality of life is elicited [1].",

More recently, deficits in adaptive behaviour as well as in intelligence have been incorporated into definitions of intellectual disability in Australia as well as overseas, and identification is directed towards establishing support needs rather than identifying group or category membership. This paper explores some of the difficulties inherent in the use of psychometric concepts and measurements to identify intellectual disability from a needs perspective. Problems of test reliability and the implications of changes over time in intelligence test norms are discussed. The concept of adaptive behaviour, its construct validity, and the utility of a psychometric definition of adaptive behaviour are questioned. It is concluded that a more fruitful definition of intellectual disability might be found in psychological theories about human needs.",

The aforementioned event-related potential research has contributed to our knowledge of the temporal course of reading. Dyslexia involves difficulties in reading and spelling despite normal schooling, adequate intelligence, and equal social economic opportunities, as well as a lack of sensory acuity deficits, neurological and psychiatric diseases.

    "title": "Intelligence (IQ) Testing",
    "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Intelligence tests assess a person's mental abilities and compare them with the abilities of other people through the use of numerical scores. Although the term intelligence is used as if there is agreement on what it means, in reality there is much debate as to how this term should be and has been defined. For example, debate has surrounded whether intelligence should be considered an inherent cognitive capacity, an achieved level of performance, or a qualitative construct that cannot be measured. Psychologists have debated whether intelligence is learned or inherited, culturally specific or universal, and one ability or several abilities. While these debates are ongoing, evidence is increasing that traditional intelligence tests measure specific forms of cognitive ability that are predictive of school functioning, but do not measure the many forms of intelligence that are beyond these more specific skills, such as music, art, and interpersonal and intrapersonal abilities. (1) Despite these debates, most experts view intelligence as a person's problem-solving abilities, such as adapting to the environment and having vocabulary skills, higher-order thinking (eg, decision making, reasoning skills, verbal and nonverbal problem-solving skills), memory, and mental speed. More specifically, for the purpose of this article, intelligence is discussed as it relates to a child's score on the intelligence (IQ or \"intelligence quotient\") tests that are used most commonly to measure a person's intelligence for educational planning or neuropsychological assessment.Efforts to measure intelligence have long been a part of psychology, and despite controversy over the meaning and scope of intelligence, an IQ score can provide meaningful data about a child's cognitive abilities if put within a conceptual framework that does not overstate its meaning or implications for the child. Intelligence tests are the most studied and, consequently, the most reliable, valid, and useful tests available for measuring specific cognitive abilities. Within a particular IQ test, children tend to perform the same on items designed to assess the same ability, which suggests internal consistency. The tests are reliable because children generally receive the same score when they retake the same test years later, although the reliability of the test usually increases with the age of the child. Test validity is based on numerous studies that have found high correlations between children's IQ scores and their performance in school, achievement tests, and tests of specific intellectual functioning (eg, measures of language, visual motor processing).An IQ score reflects a child's performance on an intelligence test relative to that of children of the same age. In short, a child's IQ score tells the extent to which his or her performance on the test departs from average. The IQ score represents a construct of \"intelligence\" that includes a combination of verbal and nonverbal processing skills, such as vocabulary, information about the world, reasoning, short-term memory, and speed of information processing; these skills, together, are represented by the IQ score. Nearly all comprehensive psychological evaluations include some measure of intelligence. For example, for a child who is being tested to confirm a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), an intelligence test can confirm that the child's academic difficulties do not indicate a specific cognitive weakness or mild mental retardation.Most intelligence tests assess a range of verbal, visual-spatial, and problem-solving skills. Because they target multiple cognitive skills, IQ tests are composed of subtests that measure specific areas of functioning. Scores on these subtests are combined to yield measures of verbal and nonverbal problem-solving abilities, as well as a full-scale IQ score. IQ scores are assumed to be normally distributed in the population, with most scores falling in the middle of the distribution and fewer scores falling at the upper and lower extremes (FigureF1). The average IQ score on most IQ tests is 100, with a standard deviation of 15. Most IQ scores (about 68%) fall within 1 standard deviation on either side of the mean (eg, between 85 and 115), and almost all scores (99% of population) fall within 3 standard deviations above or below the mean.School-age children most frequently are tested with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Fourth Edition (WISC-IV). The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III) is the test used most frequently for adolescents ages 16 and older. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence –Third Edition (WPPSI-III) is used most frequently to test children ages 2½ to 6 years of age. Each of these tests is composed of subtests that measure a variety of domains. The WISC-IV contains 15 subtests that are divided into 10 core subtests and 5 supplemental (ie, optional) subtests, which form four composites scales (referred to as \"factor scores\"): Verbal Comprehension (verbal knowledge and the ability to use verbal skills in new situations), Perceptual Organization (the ability to think about and organize visual material without the use of words), Working Memory (the ability to hold information in memory to manipulate it or perform calculations with it), and Processing Speed (the speed at which one can process simple visual information without making errors). The TableT1 lists the WISC-IV subtests and factor scores. Although there are tests of infant \"intelligence,\" such as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, most tests for children younger than age 3 years measure abilities, such as sensorimotor development and early language skills, which are not highly correlated with later IQ.Intelligence tests are reasonably accurate at predicting which children will be successful in school and which will have difficulty, with correlations between intelligence tests and measures of educational achievement averaging about 0.50. Thus, IQ tests are one of the best single indices of how well a child will do in school. However, IQ test scores are not the sole predictive factor of how a person will perform in school and are not the definitive indication of how a person eventually will function in society because other variables, such as intellectual domains not measured by a specific test, parenting, quality of schooling, motivation, and exposure to culture and books, also are important determinants of success in life. Research has shown that IQ constancy increases with age, although correlations tend to be slightly higher for elementary students than for high school or college students. Generally, the correlations with educational achievement and IQ are highest for verbal subjects, such as reading. In contrast, the predictive power of IQ test scores before the first birthday are not very strong for children who fall in the average to superior range, (2) but the tests are fairly predictive (ranging in studies from 0.50 to 0.97) for children assessed at lower IQ levels (ie, below IQs of 50). (3)Overall, the general rule of thumb is that the older the child, the more stable the IQ. By age 4 years, the correlation with IQ 12 years later is relatively high (r=0.77). (2) Although many older children show little fluctuation in their IQ scores, research has indicated that a subset of younger children show wide fluctuation in IQ scores. Finally, even older children may show some fluctuations in scores in response to major stressors such as a loss of a parent, divorce, or change in schools. With these possible exceptions, by around age 10 years, IQ scores generally are relatively stable.IQ is influenced by genetic factors (eg, the child's genetic makeup), familial factors (eg, parents' IQs and education and quality of the home environment), educational factors (eg, quality of educational opportunities and teaching), and other factors, such as the community in which the child lives. Environmental influences on the development of intelligence include access to stimulating or enriching experiences, caregivers who help the child learn problem-solving skills, access to books and sources of knowledge, good nutrition, a high level of social support, parental involvement in the child's learning and education, an enriched language environment, good school attendance, good schools, and stable neighborhoods. (4)Cultural and ethnic differences in performance on intelligence tests also have been documented. For example, studies have indicated that the average scores on standardized intelligence tests of children from African-American and Latino families often are below those of children from Caucasian families. However, the available data do not support a genetic interpretation; (5) rather, the differences likely reflect a cultural or language bias.In addition to innate and background factors, an almost limitless list of intervening variables can affect a child's performance on an IQ test. A qualified test administrator attempts to minimize such variables as much as possible, but influencing factors can include the location of the evaluation (eg, noisy office), previous testing experiences that may result in practice effects, the examiner-examinee interaction, a negative stance on the part of the child, peer-group pressure to fail, or poor motivation. Other causes of poor performance can include limited hearing or visual acuity, a lack of proficiency with the English language, situational stressors, poor attentional skills, or acute emotional difficulties such as depression or anxiety.In general, children's factor scores on the WISC-IV should be fairly similar; the more variability observed in factor scores, the higher the probability that the child has a learning or cognitive disability. Previous versions of the WISC provided verbal and performance IQ scores in addition to a full-scale IQ. Differences greater than 15 points between a child's verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning scores are worthy of an explanation and may be cause for concern because many learning disabilities result in large verbal-performance splits on IQ tests. For example, many children who have dyslexia have lower verbal abilities compared with nonverbal abilities because dyslexia is a verbally based learning disability. Children who have nonverbal learning disabilities, by definition, have lower perceptual reasoning scores compared with verbal comprehension abilities and frequently have significantly weak processing speed scores, as well. However, even a 15-point difference does not necessarily indicate the presence of a learning disability. This is because differences in styles of thinking and learning are common and often are reflected in a child's pattern of IQ scores, such as in the case of a child who has superior intellect and has a verbal comprehension index of 140 and a perceptual reasoning index of 120. That said, if an extremely large (>25-point) verbal comprehension-perceptual reasoning split is present, and if one of these scores is below the average range, psychologists frequently refer the child to a neurologist or to a developmental pediatrician to rule out the possibility of neurologic impairment. Even if the difference between a child's factor scores on an IQ test is large, the discrepancy should not be used alone to make a diagnosis of a learning disability or to predict brain functioning without substantial support from other test data and observations. Finally, when the differences between a child's WISC-IV factor scores are significant, the full-scale IQ may not be a valid measure of the child's level of overall intellectual functioning because the IQ may represent a forced \"average\" of very disparate skills.To evaluate specific learning disabilities, such as a reading disorder, disorder of written expression, or math disability, IQ tests typically are used in conjunction with achievement tests. Achievement tests are designed to measure what a child has actually learned, including mathematical problem-solving, reading, spelling, writing, or an understanding of science concepts. Most achievement tests focus on a particular subject and measure a child's learning with questions of varying difficulty. The child's score then either is compared with that of a child of the same age or grade or measured against an objective standard. When used to diagnose a specific learning disability, a child's academic achievement in one or more areas is compared with his or her intellectual abilities. If a child's ability in one or more areas of achievement, as measured on standardized tests, is significantly lower than expectations based on age, education, and intelligence, the probability is high that a learning disability exists. However, these difficulties also must impede the child's ability in academic achievement or activities of daily living. Also, if the child has a sensory deficit, such as in visual perception, memory, or attention, the difficulties in math or writing need to be worse than what would be expected with the sensory deficit alone. For example, if a child who has ADHD has problems with math, the math difficulties must be worse than what would be expected from a child who has attentional difficulties. Thus, although IQ and achievement tests are used frequently to diagnose a learning disability, a simple discrepancy is not sufficient to make the diagnosis because other issues need to be eliminated.In addition, the lack of a discrepancy is not necessarily an indication that a learning disability does not exist. This is particularly true for the young child who may exhibit early signs of a learning disability, but who does not yet lag behind to the extent that a discrepancy exists. In these cases, the pattern of scores on relevant tests (eg, reading fluency, phonics skills, reading comprehension, prereading skills) becomes primary in the diagnosis of a learning disability. Because current federal law recognizes the shortcomings of a discrepancy approach in determining a learning disability, school districts are not bound by the discrepancy criteria before children are found to be eligible for special education services. However, current law also states that the lack of achievement must not be due to mental retardation; a visual, hearing, or motor impairment; emotional disturbance; or environmental disadvantage. Thus, intelligence tests typically are given to rule out the possibility that a cognitive deficit underlies the child's difficulties with academic skills.Intelligence is a multifaceted construct that, for the purposes of this review, is operationalized as the standard IQ tests (eg, Wechsler Scales) used by schools and psychologists to measure cognitive functioning in a formal environment. Intelligence scores predict the ease with which people learn in formal situations, but do not necessarily predict success in life or occupations. Measures of intelligence can be affected by fluency of language, access to educational stimulation, educational resources, motivation, and emotional functioning. Variability in terms of subtest or factor score performance may be a sign of a learning disability, but a simple discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal abilities is not sufficient to diagnose a learning disability. Comparisons of IQs with tests of academic achievement frequently are used in diagnosing specific learning disabilities, but schools and diagnosticians are not bound by the discrepancy criteria. However, to diagnosis a specific learning disability, the possibility of a cognitive deficit needs to be ruled out, which typically is done through the administration of an IQ test. Overall, IQ tests are the most reliable and valid instruments used to measure a person's cognitive abilities, but they always should be interpreted within a conceptual framework that does not overstate its implications for the child.",

Vitality is seen as the ability to cope with one’s own life, the result of positive adaptation despite adverse conditions and / or dangerous circumstances. Vitality is characterized by a combination of social and intrapsychic processes that allow a person to be healthy in an unfavorable environment. The manifestation of a person’s ability to cope with difficult circumstances, unfavorable life situations is influenced by various factors, including the possibility / impossibility of productive self-expression, sufficient involvement / non-involvement in taking care of oneself and important life processes, searching and finding a solution to the problem of lack of motivation, openness / closeness, awareness / lack of awareness, etc. An essential point in the development of a person’s vitality is the provision of the necessary specially organized psychological assistance aimed at optimizing the client’s self-esteem, developing his assertiveness, sense of humor, flexibility, creativity, motivational-semantic sphere and reflective culture.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits such as memory problems have a major impact on independence in daily life and participation in society in several populations, such as people with dementia, brain injury (i.e. stroke) or a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia. Similarities in the impact on participation and well-being have resulted in the development of comparable psychosocial interventions across populations, aiming to support people to adapt to cognitive deficits or by adapting the environment. These interventions are developed separately, without using the expertise in other fields. We argue that each of the fields and the field of psychosocial care in general would benefit from closer collaboration on development and evaluation of innovative psychosocial interventions. Collaboration has been complicated by the use of different care models and theoretical frameworks, each with their own terminology. The concept of social health - the ability to participate in work or other meaningful activities and to feel healthy despite a condition - translates to the leading care models within the fields of dementia, brain injury and severe mental illness. The concept of social health provides a common language and framework. In this paper, we elaborate on strategies for collaboration using examples of interventions to improve social health.",

Each difficulty of a person with intellectual disabilities tended to be interpreted as an expression of low intelligence, rather than be analysed with the specific and scientifically grounded constructs of developmental cognitive psychology and neuropsychology. This chapter explores how low development of attention and inhibitory control, working memory and language can generate important, though individually variable differences, in reasoning, knowledge acquisition and adaptive skills of people with intellectual disabilities. In this chapter, the authors argue that clinicians' attitudes should change from a type of assessment that only takes a static picture of the IQ level of a child to a more dynamic perspective that looks for the specific abilities and motivational factors allowing development to move ahead.",

    "title": "DEVELOPING A CULTURE OF MINDFUL LEARNING: CHALLENGES, BENEFITS, AND OPPORTUNITIES",
    "abstract": "Learning is an individual process for each student. People can be aware of own learning or do not think about it at all in the diverse situations of life. However, in the pedagogical reality, the awareness of students' learning is essential as it contributes to self-regulation of behaviour and self-reflection of actions, striving towards continuous self-development. It is important to be aware of oneself mentally and physically, understanding and accepting own thoughts or feelings. The integration of all areas of personal development becomes relevant, as changes in one area are linked to changes in another. Awareness of own learning directs the learner towards the social, emotional and academic dimension, including not only awareness of the knowledge and acquired skills, but awareness of own goals, motivations, emotions, interests, the personal relevance of the learning content and also the variability of the current situation, strategies for future learning, and other elements of the learning process. Mindfulness can also be seen as a powerful 'antidote' to common mental health problems, e.g. fatigue, exhaustion, apathy, anxiety and difficulty in concentrating. Mindfulness practices can be implemented at schools as an element of the lesson, but it is also important to purposefully create a culture of mindfulness at the institutional level, which can be greatly facilitated by the professional development of teachers. Mindfulness is a mental state of being reflective in the present moment. It provides the ability to live intensely in the present moment, acceptance of own thoughts and feelings, a sense of perspective and the ability to cope with stressful situations through conscious concentration. The aim of this publication is to analyze the theoretical aspects of mindfulness, the possibilities of facilitating the learning process through mindfulness practices, as well as to carry out empirical research evaluating 16-19-year-old students` self-awareness skills, the phenomenon of the presence of mindfulness in their learning process and its impact on their learning outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: The problems of emotional intelligence (emotional quotient, EQ), success and psychological adaptability to the environment in the complex and systemic integrity are important factors in ensuring the effectiveness of social administration. The modern form of social administration involves the factors of emotional leadership and emotion management, including the ability to connect with people, inspire and encourage them, keep them highly motivated and achieve the development and prosperity of the social organisation as a whole. The concept of «emotional intelligence» is closely related to the categories of «social success» and «psychological adaptability to the environment». The latter two factors should be interpreted as a consequence of sufficient development of emotional intelligence of a fully developed person. People due to objective reasons have different levels of EQ. Following this, they are differentiated as either socially successful or not socially successful, adaptive or not susceptible to the mechanisms of psychological adaptation to the environment. This differentiation is partly a genetic predisposition of a person to manifest organisational abilities and leadership qualities, but no less important are the purposeful and organised efforts of people to learn, develop and self-improve their emotional and intellectual qualities. In social management it is of particular importance, because it significantly affects the effectiveness of interaction between objects and subjects of administration, thus creating a favourable emotional climate in the team or, on the contrary, contributing to the rise of negative, pessimistic and emotionally unstable moods in the managed community.&#x0D; Research methods. When studying the problems of emotional intelligence, success and psychological adaptability to the environment, the author used a wide range of methods of cognition, which are developed and tested by modern socio-psychological science. Among them there are analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, observation, survey, method of analysing documents and results of social activity.&#x0D; Results. As a result, the author proposes a number of theoretical and methodological constructs and practical guidelines for social managers, which enable them to take into account the emotional content of administratively significant information, to maintain a proper sensual atmosphere of communication, to minimise socio-psychological conflictogens and to suppress unconstructive interaction between people.",

The terms intellectual development and cognitive development are often used interchangeably. However, it can be argued that the scope of intellectual development should be broader than cognitive development, as it goes beyond the development of specific cognitive structures and functions to encompass issues of the effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity of a living system trying to achieve its goals in a complex and sometimes treacherous environment. Intellectual development is clearly associated with knowledge acquisition through experience and formal instruction, yet intellectual development connotes the growth of a mind that has more pervasive, transferable power than narrowly defined knowledge and skills or expertise.",

    "title": "THE DIAGNOSTICS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE OF THE PERSON USING PROVERBS AND SAYINGS",
    "abstract": "In this article social intelligence of teachers of pre-school educational establishments was analyzed in the context of understanding by the person the meaning of proverbs and sayings which include socially determined sense. The author of the article considers the most important criteria for productive functioning of the teacher’s social intelligence so called successful solution of human social non-standard (including – the most original) tasks, as well as the success of a specialist in the implementation of pedagogical activities. The first involves the mandatory functioning of decision-making mechanism. This mechanism, as well as other functional mechanisms of social intelligence (the mechanism of decentralization, the mechanism of intellectual initiation, reflexive mechanisms, etc.), are predetermined by individual cognition, for example, attention, imagination, perception, memory, thinking. That’s why we have a deal with automatism of functional mechanisms of social intelligence. In the field of mnemonic experience (the mnemonic aspect of social intelligence) conscious experiences are accompanied by a sense of subjective evidence of what had been happened. The mechanism of making a socially balanced decision was analyzed taking into account the complexity, non-standard social situation. This mechanism allows the teacher to move away from intellectual formations of a person as a representative of a certain national-cultural space, and, avoiding prototypes and ethnic stereotypes, to choose the most appropriate for this social situation the mechanism for updating the reflection of the subjective space, the cognitive style of carrying out professional activity, and building a development logic situations of interpersonal interaction, taking into account moral and ethnic norms, values, etc., to make a socially weighed decision. The latter will contribute not only because the teacher will adequately and empathically interact with other actors (colleagues and trustees), but also, including the achievement of the teacher of success in the professional activity. In the functional aspect we are talking about the amplification of social intelligence.&#x0D; The empirical results of our research allow to distinguish the following tendencies: 1) there are no statistically significant differences in the results of teachers of different groups (including the directors of pre-school educational institutions) according to the success of their interpretation of social meaning at a generalized level; 2) teachers of pre-school educational institutions prevail over the following levels of understanding the meaning of proverbs (sayings), as the “level of concrete understanding” and the “level of global understanding”.",

    "title": "Internalizing Behaviors",
    "abstract": "Internalizing behaviors can affect academics and social skills and result in medical issues. Many internalizing behaviors can be present together, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety, or depression. Eating disorders are often accompanied with anxiety and/or depressive disorders, and those identified with anxiety or depression may have symptoms of both. Interventions are needed to help individuals manage their internalizing behaviours. Interventions that have been successful in treating depression include cognitive behavioral therapy, problem-solving skills training, cognitive restructuring, pleasant activity planning, relaxation therapy, self-management training, family involvement, and interpersonal psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a combination of cognitive and behavioral interventions. Although anxiety management/relaxation training is not a traditional depression intervention, there have been studies that prove it is an effective strategy for improving depression. Students are first helped to understand the relationship between life stressors and anxiety and/or depression.",

    "title": "Career Indecision in Adolescents",
    "abstract": "evolution of fundamental concepts of occupational indecision–or career indecision–is initially summarized: dichotomous, developmental, cognitive, and multifactor concepts. Then, some typical evaluation tools that have enabled more fundamental research work on identity, intercultural differences, and the effects of guidance-related practices are presented. Finally, the evolution of fundamental concepts is mentioned through its possible avatar– uncertainty. Indecision, i.e., the inability of a person to make a choice when encouraged to do so, is an irritating state for the researcher who wishes to explain it, as it is for the expert who wishes to reduce it. Career indecision relates to the incapacity to make decisions about a major or a vocation. Career choices are worked out in two large frames of reference: family and school, the effects of which are pointed out. Various designs have been built, all of which cannot be set out: especially, strictly clinical approaches or those related to career decisions of adults engaged in the professional Indecision is often approached in a dichotomic–almost administrative–way, by the opposition of decided/undecided people. Studies on the frequency of indecision (lack of choice) and contrasts between decided/undecided adolescents turned out to be rather disappointing. Indeed, during adolescence, indecision often doesn't mean lack of career choice, but indicates a period of development of this choice. In the developmental approaches of decisions, some adolescents make choices rather quickly (and, therefore, are said to be decided) and others more slowly (and are said to be undecided). However, either quickly or slowly, some adolescents manage not to decide. Two forms have been distinguished: a developmental, normal indecision, and another form, more problematic and marked by a strong anxiety, chronic indecision. Undecided adolescents are thus not a homogeneous group: some are undecided and others indecisive and they undergo different processes. These processes have been studied within the framework of Cognitive Information Processing, where decision is considered as an application of several mechanisms, the dysfunction of the one being sufficient to create an undecided state. The location of these mechanisms is supposed to allow a reduction of indecision–which is not always true. Factors of indecision are indeed numerous and have been described in multifactorial approaches. A differential diagnosis of indecision is necessary for understanding the state of a person; this diagnosis makes it possible to assess the role of different factors (as lack of information or lack of decision method). These last approaches require precise data and adapted tools have been elaborated; some– among the most typical–are presented. With these tools, more fundamental problems have been examined as the question of identity, intercultural differences, and assessment of guidance practices. The assessment of these practices may be located among a body of research in France, from which one relates to college students: it is for an average indecision at the beginning of college (university) that the later examination grades are highest. The idea of optimum indecision is then taken up in a more general way: depending on situations, an amount of indecision is adaptive and the current evolution of the professional world seems to indicate that indecision–which becomes a perceived uncertainty– could increasingly become more efficient because it leaves the person free to adapt to the modifications of the world.",

    "title": "NON COGNITIVE SKILLS AS THE NEW METRIC IN RECENT LABOR MARKETS – CASE STUDY: THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN PROMOTING AND DEVELOPING SKILLS",
    "abstract": "Recent trends seem to conclude that computerization leads to the transformation of already skilled employees into characters that possess certain criteria such as flexibility, team spirit, communication, motivation, critical thinking, adaptive, multi-tasking and innovative responses, well-being, social and collaborative problem-solving abilities, etc. The prementioned skills are usually referred to as non-cognitive skills or soft skills or socio-emotional skills and in general they are considered to be major predictors of adult professional life. In fact, it is widely accepted that part of these skills is usually acquired in early childhood as well as in primary and secondary schooling, yet it appears to be a major factor of employment dynamics and future income throughout life. On the other hand, there is lack of clarity and measurement in the process of studying, defining and classifying soft skills. As a result, at the moment there are no sufficient customized tools that specifically measure the procedures of possessing or gradually developing behavioral and attitudinal skills so consequently there is absence of proportionate skills development policies. At the same time, as internet tends to shape pedagogy and overall education and training, soft skills continue to reform constantly adding up to the present yet unsolved matter of soft skills tools measurement modeling. Meanwhile, as online markets are rapidly growing, many e-communities worldwide are promoting specific sets of soft skills, usually by posting impressive job applications or by using digital matching tools that make online recruitment more attractive, interesting and promising to both employers and jobseekers, finally augmenting the already long list of soft skills. As this has been the case during the recent years, many new non-taught personal skills have been arising. Consequently, questions and thoughts regarding their methodology development tend to be crucial. In the present paper, the above issues are thoroughly discussed and analyzed. In addition, a classification of the new skills in demand is attempted in terms of recent real labor and on line market, mainly by researching through social media platforms and focusing on the recent changes in skills demand as well the ways some of these skills are often cultivated subconsciously mainly through frequent use of social media, according to social media marketers that participated in the present research. Finally, the current paper hopes to add up to the ways new skills taxonomy may be incorporated in education and training sectors, business sectors, private sectors and policy makers by proposing ways that upgrade job skills in response to worldwide labor market's signals in order to best prepare in terms of human resource development.",

    "title": "Reading Comprehension and Reading Disability",
    "abstract": "Virtually all reading researchers and theorists, regardless \nof their views of reading development, regard comprehension as the gold standard in de ning prima facie reading \ndif culties. Thus, even if a good comprehender exhibited \nsome de cits in particular skill areas (e.g., phonics or \nmonitoring), we would say that those variations from the \nideal were differences that did not make a difference, or \nperhaps disabilities that did not make a difference. Conversely, if a student was skilled at decoding, oral language \nvocabulary, and monitoring but could not understand the \nmost basic material, we would conclude that he or she \nhad a reading dif culty and, depending on our view of the \nneurology of reading, perhaps even a disability. Less than \nideal comprehension, then, is the key criterion in de ning \ndisability. When it comes to addressing poor comprehension performance, the key question is what is the basis of \nthe performance de cit? What is it about a student’s intellectual makeup, skill repertoire, knowledge, experience, \ndispositions, or instructional history that might account for \nthe prima facie failing in comprehension? Other questions \nreadily follow: (a) Is the nature of disability the same for \nall poor comprehenders or are there different patterns of \ndisability with different etiologies for different classes of \nstudents?

    "title": "The effectiveness of a rational, emotional, behavioral program in modifying the irrational thoughts related to the pressures of life for forced retirees",
    "abstract": "Thinking includes cognitive processes implicit or explicit, or an internal mental perception of events or things, or a mental means by which a person deals with facts, things and events through the cognitive processes that are represented in the use of symbols, concepts and words. Thinking and style are its types, it is the outcome of interaction between several changes, such as an individual’s past, past experiences, ability to teach, level of education, level of education and social upbringing, cultural and civilizational factors and the influence of the surrounding environment. Work is one of the important factors that affect the life of a pensioner. Without it, the individual suffers from many social and psychological diseases, such as isolation, depression, anxiety, stress and fear. Work is the basis of respect for the individual and the respect of people for him, and the individual achieves many gratifications through his work, and when he loses it, he is exposed to many frustrated situations related to his inaction. Compulsory retirement is the second of the growth crises experienced by the individual after the crisis of adolescence. Compulsory retirement from work has become one of the most important problems facing them. Here, there are many studies that dealt with adaptation to retirement, which emphasized the importance of preparing for the post-retirement phase so that the individual avoids potential psychological disorders and to achieve a sound psychological and social harmony and a smooth transition to the retirement stage. Irrational thoughts come as a result of false cognitive precipitations in forced retirees, resulting in many socio-psychological problems, such as the problem of family relationships and a tendency to depression. Accordingly, the problem of the study was determined in a question: What is the effectiveness of a professional intervention program within the framework of strategies and methods of rational emotional-emotional-behavioral therapy in modifying the irrational thoughts related to the pressures of life for forced retirees?",

Active coping with stress and resilience have been associated with lower levels of denial, avoidant coping behaviour and behavioural disengagement in facing fears. Resilient individuals are also characterized by optimism and high positive emotionality.

    "title": "THE PROBLEM OF PERSONALITY YOUTH AGE PROCRASTINATION",
    "abstract": "Purpose is to explore the contemporary state of personality youth age procrastination problem elaboration in psychological science.Methods. Theoretical analysis of psychological phenomenon procrastination, comparison, classification and synthesis of modern scientifical research of procrastination in youth were used. Results. Research of professional psychological literature promote understanding of procrastination, generalization and arrangement of ideas about specifics of this psychological phenomenon development in personal world of youth age individual.Conclusions. Procrastination is complex psychological phenomenon, its experience comes with negative emotions. This phenomenon display people response on social necessity in accomplishment of low personal significant activity. In youth individual faces not only the need to construct his own personal goals, but also the need to work hard for realization of his life plans at first. High complexity of this goal achievement and absence of life success guarantees causes young men and women to delay such activities or fix on procrastination strategy. Procrastination comes over not only common socially determined activities, but also take form of personal generalized life strategy. Expressed procrastination causes decline of personality’s life energy in different ways of his social world. It can become cause effortless life stance at all. Procrastination is nearly concerned in different phenomena of individual personal world. An “active” procrastinators feel high anxiety, anger, temper. Such negative emotions cause mobilization of their own psychological resources for realization and finish of necessary procrastinated activity. Unlike them, “passive” procrastinators feel sad, disappointment, boredom. They realistically predict future social sanctions. But they don’t finish their activity in time. In elder youth young people develop their ability in management of their own procrastination. In increasing frequency, they use this strategy for short-time planning of complex or new tasks realization. But, according to modern scientists’ research analysis, elder youth aged youngsters often use ineffective ways of procrastination. Key words: personality, procrastination, youth age, delay, anxiety, social pressure. Мета – дослідити сучасний стан розробки проблеми прокрастинації особистості юнацького віку в психологічній науці.Методи. Використано такі методи, як: теоретичний аналіз психологічного феномена прокрастинації, порівняння, класифікація та синтез сучасних наукових досліджень прокрастинації в юності. Результати. Дослідження фахової психологічної літератури сприяє поглибленню розуміння про-крастинації, а також узагальненню і систематизації уявлень щодо специфіки становлення цього психологічного утворення в особистісному світі індивідуума юнацького віку.Висновки. Проаналізовано явище прокрастинації як складне психологічне утворення, переживання якого супроводжується негативними емоціями. Цей феномен відображає реакцію людини на соціальну необхідність виконання діяльності низької особистісної значущості. Специфіку особистісного розвитку молодої людини в юності визначає те, що вона вперше постає перед необхідністю не лише конструювати власні життєві цілі, але й докладати значних зусиль для реалізації своїх життєвих планів. Виявлено, що висока складність досягнення таких цілей та відсутність гарантій життєвого успіху спричинюють праг-нення юнаків і дівчат відкласти відповідні справи, точніше вибрати стратегію прокрастинації. Проаналізовано специфіку прокрастинації діяльності (відкладання юнаками та юнками побутових соціально детермінованих справ) та прокрастинації в прийнятті життєвих рішень (відкладання як генералізованої стійкої стратегії особистості). Виражена прокрастинація спричинює гальмування життєвої енергії людини в різних аспектах її соціального світу та може спричинювати становлення пасивної життєвої позиції загалом. Результати теоретичного аналізу також дають можливість констатувати, що особистість юнацького віку певною мірою може регулювати власну стратегію прокрастинації. «Активні» прокрастинатори переживають високу тривожність, гнів, роздратування. Ці негативні емоції сприяють мобілізації ними власних психологічних ресурсів для виконання і завершення необхідної діяльності, що підлягає прокрастинації. На відміну від них, «пасивні» прокрастинатори виявляють емоції суму, розчарування, нудьги. Вони здійснюють реалістичний прогноз подальших соціальних санкцій. Але не завершують діяльність у необхідні строки. Доведено, що впродовж пізньої юності молоді люди більш вибірково використовують стратегію відкладання у своїй життєдіяльності. Все частіше використовують цю стратегію для короткотривалого планування виконання складних чи нових завдань. Однак аналіз результатів досліджень сучасних учених показав, що і в пізньому юнацькому віці особистість часто вдається до неефективних способів прокрастинації.Ключові слова: особистість, прокрастинація, юнацький вік, відкладання, тривожність, соціальний тиск.",

    "title": "Wisdom in Context",
    "abstract": "Philosophers and psychological scientists have converged on the idea that wisdom involves certain aspects of thinking (e.g., intellectual humility, recognition of uncertainty and change), enabling application of knowledge to life challenges. Empirical evidence indicates that people’s ability to think wisely varies dramatically across experiential contexts that they encounter over the life span. Moreover, wise thinking varies from one situation to another, with self-focused contexts inhibiting wise thinking. Experiments can show ways to buffer thinking against bias in cases in which self-interests are unavoidable. Specifically, an ego-decentering cognitive mind-set enables wise thinking about personally meaningful issues. It appears that experiential, situational, and cultural factors are even more powerful in shaping wisdom than previously imagined. Focus on such contextual factors sheds new light on the processes underlying wise thought and its development, helps to integrate different approaches to studying wisdom, and has implications for measurement and development of wisdom-enhancing interventions.",

Skills are interpreted as actions that a person performs to acquire motor or intellectual abilities, carrying out those actions in the appropriate manner. It is shown that, alongside new skills, new knowledge and habits also emerge during the process of activity. Skills are formed through various activities in the learning process, such as work, tasks, games, exercises, tests, projects, etc. In the classification presented in the article, skills are divided into fields such as perception, learning, labor, or-ganization, communication, and so on. The psychophysiological characteristics of motor skills, which form the basis of other skills, are explained. It is stated that without motor skills, the development of other skills is impossible. The article also provides a classification of cognitive skills. A brief explanation is given for cognitive skills formed through the perception of sensory signals, attention, memory, thinking, speech, and other cognitive processes. Another issue highlighted is the relationship between cognitive skills and other psychological constructs that stimulate their application. It is noted that the social-cognitive skills include motivation, teamwork, self-regulation, organizational skills, goal setting, decision making, social intelligence, emotional intelligence, social role behavior, and so on. In conclusion, the important role of skills in human life and professional activity is emphasized.",

Specific examples are given as to how visual perceptual exercises may also be used to enhance the child's development in language, sensory-motor functions, higher thought processes, integrative abilities, and social and emotional growth. Principles of teaching, such as over-learning, directing attention, individualization, and personalization apply to ability training as well as to teaching of academics. Facilitation of transfer of initial visual perceptual training to academic skills is discussed and illustrated,",

    "title": "Social cognition and its potential role in bipolar disorder roughening",
    "abstract": "The present issue of Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica contains a very elegant and comprehensive review and meta-analysis by Professor Strejilevich’s emerging group (1) on the state of the art of social cognition in bipolar patients. According to the authors, deficits in theory of mind and emotion processing would occur even in euthymic bipolar disorder (BD) patients, while decision making would be preserved. It is also known that social cognition impairment may lead to poor social functioning (2). The term ‘social cognition’ is used to refer to various abilities that allow people to process social information, especially its encoding, storage, retrieval, and application to social situations. It comprises several skills. The most widely used social cognition abilities include emotion processing—the ability to identify and appraise the emotions displayed by other people—decision making, or the effect of reward and punishment on behavior selection, and theory of mind—the ability to attribute mental states such as beliefs, desires, and intents to oneself and others. In summary, social cognitive skills allow us to properly understand or judge the world from an interactive, affective, and empathic perspective. Social cognition is known to be affected in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and severe psychiatric conditions as schizophrenia and unipolar depression. However, an issue that needs to be clarified concerns to how big is the word ‘social’ in the ‘social cognition’ construct. In other words, is social cognition impairment merely epiphenomena of neurocognitive impairment? Both decision making and theory of mind might be strongly influenced by executive frontal components, and in fact, both seem to be related to gray matter volume reduction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (3). As for emotional processing, it has been described how damage to the fusiform gyrus, in the temporal lobe, can lead to the inability to recognize faces and that amygdale, a usual suspect in bipolar disorders’ pathophysiology, strongly influences fusiform gyrus function during face perception (4). To what extent social cognition dysfunctions are merely the clinical expression of soft neurological signs occurring in bipolar disorders remains as something to be further studied. On the other hand, although Samamé and colleagues find social cognition to be independent from mood state, it is also true that subsyndromal symptoms and medications may also play a role. It is well known, for instance, that even low doses of antidepressants during a few days may improve emotional processing and recognition in depressed patients (5). Social cognition might even be involved in the sensitization phenomena related to bipolar illness. Bipolar individuals with affected social cognition skills may get involved in social stressful events more often due to their inability to ‘read’ what is happening, to weigh the risks involved in a social situation, or to take the right decision deriving from it. Hence, this enhanced likelihood for negative life events would trigger many episodes and, finally, worsen the course of the disorder. Later on, as supported by the kindling models, the disorder itself develops some biological autonomy, progressively allowing for more neurological soft signs, social, and neurocognitive impairment, biological sensitization and outcome worsening in a never-ending cycle. All this needs to be taken into account in both the pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches to bipolar patients. From a pharmacological perspective, we may hypothesize that an energetic and early treatment with mood-stabilizing agents may even have positive effects on social cognition and stop or slow down the roughening cycle described above. From a psychological treatments perspective, we should consider both the early implementation of psychoeducational programs and the potential role of cognitive rehabilitation. Newer cognitive rehabilitation programs should include social cognition remediation. The fear of patronizing the patient by using a very directive intervention would be by far counterbalanced by the benefits deriving from prevention of both some life events and episodes. The political nuisance of using ‘cognitive orthopaedics’—such as some functional remediation models—is by far counterbalanced by its daily benefits in our patients’ both functional and clinical prognosis, and quality of life. All that said, clinicians have to keep in mind the extreme interindividual variability among all bipolar patients regarding social cognition. Some affected individuals really master social cognition and are particularly gifted with social and political leadership abilities, while others show extremely poor social cognition skills. Or, from an evolutionary perspective, some social cognition problems would be apparently rewarded by the group as they allow for a more effective leadership, particularly important when facing a critical situation. At the end of the day, the world did not ask Theodore Roosevelt or Winston Churchill to be empathic, but effective. A proper assessment of social cognition is needed to determine its possible impairment for all patients given its clinical, prognostic, functional, and therapeutic significance. Samané et al. paper in this issue of Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica will help us to further understand why.

Not usually a deficit in techno-rational knowledge (although such presumed deficits are precisely what is targeted in most attempts to fix the problem). More often the problem has been failure to build up a personal store of relevant up-to-date specialist knowledge. Still more often it stems from deficits in tacit knowledge … (unverbalised) knowledge of ways of doing things. But most often it stems from a failure to consider the wider needs of clients and a disregard of the consequences of rule-bound actions grounded solely in disciplinary knowledge. In other words, by failure to engage with issues which lie outside the individual’s domain of specialist knowledge. In such a context, the concept of certifiable professional competence becomes an oxymoron.",

    "abstract": "The article raises the issue of developing a psychologist in the sphere of education. Emphasis is made on social and psychological conditions promoting the professional sensitivity of a psychologist, which determine the efficiency of their performance. This property is the level of sensitivity which allows detecting the subtlest indicators of a mental phenomenon. The structure of professional sensitivity is assumed to comprise four components: sensory properties (all types of sensitivity – from visual and auditory to olfactory); mnemic properties (memory capacity, speed of memorizing, durability of memorizing, accuracy and speed of reproducing, ability for immediate reproduction at a certain moment); imaginative properties depending on the individual characteristics of imagination; and attention properties (selectivity, volume, steadiness, abilities to distribute and switch attention). Professional sensitivity is not static; it develops and its structure improves with professional advancement. The research showed that a training of sensitivity for psychologists in educational sphere sets conditions for forming higher levels of selectivity, concentration and switching of attention; for development of empathy, communicability, emotional stability, sensitivity, independence, and self-control. The research topicality is due to developing professional sensitivity necessary to fulfill the professional requirements to a psychologist in the sphere of education.",

    "title": "Age as a Differential-Psychological Factor of the Axiopsychological Design of Life Personal Achievements",
    "abstract": "The paper considers the concept of “chronological age”, approaches to its understanding, and features of use. The leading psychological characteristics of the period of adulthood – early, middle, and late – are outlined. It is noted that the period of adulthood (or maturity) is the longest phase of ontogenesis (in developed countries it is 3⁄4 of the human life), which tends to achieve the highest development of physical, intellectual, and spiritual abilities of the individual. Signs of adulthood are given, namely: other nature of development, less related to physical growth and rapid cognitive improvement; the ability to react, respond to changes, and successfully adapt to new conditions, constructively resolve contradictions and difficulties; overcoming addiction and the ability to take responsibility for oneself and others; certain character traits (firmness, moderation, reliability, honesty, ability to empathize, etc.); social and cultural guidelines (roles, relationships, etc.) for the success and timeliness of development in adulthood.The hypothesis about the influence of the age category on the course of axiopsychological projection of life achievements of an individual in the period of adulthood – early, middle, and late – is tested and confirmed.It was stated that the study involved 239 people, of whom 90 (38 %) were respondents of early adulthood – students of 4-5 courses majoring in “Primary Education”, 86 (36 %) – respondents of secondary, and 63 (26 %) – late adults – primary school teachers working in general secondary education institutions of Chernivtsi and Chernivtsi region.Based on the results of the empirical study, differences in the determinants of the axiopsychological design of life achievements of the individual by age were established. It was found that respondents of late adulthood better assess their psychological age in contrast to their younger colleagues – representatives of early and middle adulthood; they are also distinguished by a better indicator of subjective life, they are more optimistic, seek new knowledge, have a higher level of self-esteem and social self-efficacy, and better build a strategy of their own lives. The regularity is revealed: from the period of middle to the period of late adulthood, instrumental-subjective abilities acquire special significance in axiopsychological projection of life achievements of the person.",

Judging whether a person is exercising a cognitive or some other process, simply by observing behaviour, is not at all easy.

They underpin the consistency with which we think, act and feel across different situations and over time. Adult personality traits are thought to be derived from early life differences in temperament; these are partly genetically determined and shape exposure to social experiences.1 There have been many taxonomies of personality traits, but research over the past 20 years has converged on the view that there are five broad personality dimensions, each of which accommodates a number of lower-order traits. The five factors are: extraversion or positive emotionality (incorporating traits such as sociability, energy, shyness and dominance/subordination); neuroticism or negative emotionality (including lower-order traits such as proneness to anxiety, irritability, sadness, insecurity and guilt); conscientiousness (factors such as reliability, carefulness, persistence and self-control); agreeableness (cooperativeness, consideration, generosity, kindness and politeness); and openness to experience (imaginativeness, insight and aesthetic sensitivity). Individuals vary on all these dispositions, so each person is thought to have a particular combination of trait strengths. Personality traits predict a range of outcomes with moderate consistency, including quality of social and family relationships, marital status and satisfaction, occupational choices, political attitudes and criminality.2\n\nThe role of personality in coronary heart disease (CHD) …",

    "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Making disciplinary perspectives explicit and other best practices for interdisciplinary work in educational neuroscience Priya Kalra1* and Jamie K. O'Keefe1 1 Harvard Graduate School of Education, ISB, United States Education is a field rather than a discipline [2], and therefore lacks a single cohesive set of the defining elements of a discipline as identified by Repko [1], including assumptions, theories, methods, phenomena of interest, and epistemological perspectives. Instead, each of the disciplines that approaches problems in education (such as psychology, sociology or economics) brings its own latent set of disciplinary characteristics to the study of education. As a result, confusion and miscommunication between researchers of different disciplinary backgrounds often arises. This problem is heightened in the area of Educational Neuroscience and may be a serious hindrance to progress in the field. In previous work, we have attempted to make explicit the defining elements of disciplines contributing to educational neuroscience (such as developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and educational psychology inter alia) and demonstrate how they may conflict or cause confusion when not acknowledged, using the example of each discipline’s contributions to the study of reading disorders. Here, we build on that understanding by comparing the still-emerging interdisciplinary field of Educational Neuroscience to more established interdisciplinary fields; we will use this comparison to infer best practices for interdisciplinary work in Educational Neuroscience as well as to examine pitfalls we can avoid as the field goes forward. We believe that a wider understanding of the importance of making disciplinary perspectives explicit will lead to greater productivity in the field of Educational Neuroscience in the future.

A cognitive impairment is a consequence of a structural lesion that may be measured. Neuropsychologic testing enables us to identify that specific impairment that is a consequence of the structural deficit. Brain injury results in impaired function of localized higher-order sensory and motor function corresponding to these well-defined anatomic structures, but it also results in a variety of functions that are not clearly localized, such as the abilities to abstract and to reason. The first step in the process of rehabilitation is to identify the specific deficits. <i>Cognitive retraining</i>is a systematic attempt",

    "title": "Predicting Mental Health through Machine Learning Algorithms",
    "abstract": "The significance of mental health in accomplishing the worldwide objectives for sustainable development has been the subject of research and analysis in recent years. Although predicting psychological disorders is a difficult undertaking involving numerous considerations, current research has accomplished significant progress in this field. Using data analytics and machine learning (ML) algorithms to examine patterns and find possible markers of mental health issues is one noteworthy method. Predicting mental illness is a complex task that involves various factors, and recent research has been making strides in this area. On notable approach involves the use of ML algorithms and data analytics to analyse patterns and identify potential indicators of mental health conditions. Mental illness in the workplace can stalk from various issues, and it's often the result of a combination of personal, organizational, and societal elements. Some common reasons: job related stress, poor effort life balance, absence of job security, bullying and harassment, organizational culture, poor management practices, lack of resources for mental health support, job dissatisfaction, discrimination etc… Personality disorders, anxiety disorders, phobias, psychotic-disorders, depression, mood-disorders, eating-disorders, and other conditions can all result from mental illness. Mental health in the Open Sourcing Mental Health (OSMI) tech survey dataset, employee mental health issues are explored in this paper for their underlying causes. Objective of this data analysis is to decrease the problems associated with mental illness by educating the public about mental illness in the workplace. This article advocates and advises on the reasons for extreme mental health practices to prevent undesirable events caused by numerous elements in the working environment. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than two years of uncertainty and uncertainty for people around the world. This study quantifies perceived age-based discrimination in the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the detrimental impact of social isolation and loneliness, fear, and behavioural disturbances in older individuals based on perceptions of COVID-19 risks. The findings demonstrate that in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, perceived ageism positively predicts loneliness and serves as an indirect predictor of mental illness. In addition, fear of Covid-19, social isolation and loneliness are good indicators of mental disorder.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive, intellectual performance can be described objectively in terms of concepts like abilities, intelligence, and so on. It is possible to measure these concepts empirically, through the use of tests, problems, and questions, and indirectly through psychophysiological measures. The intercorrelations between special types of tests define certain primary mental factors, usually referred to as primary or group factors. Primary abilities correlate together to form higher order concepts, such as fluid and crystallized intelligence; these concepts are defined in terms of observed correlations. Among major primary factors or abilities thus far demonstrated by research are verbal ability, numerical ability, memory, perceptual ability, divergent ability, reasoning, visuo-spatial ability, and several others. The intelligence quotient (IQ), as measured by standard tests, can be shown to be the product of three major independent factors; mental speed, persistence, and error checking mechanisms. This \"splitting\" of the IQ suggests more analytical research designs than have been customary hitherto.",

The research question refers to the content of dimensions for distinct concepts of “informal learning”. The analysis has disclosed the “informal learning” to be continuum between “self-directed learning”, “self-regulated learning”, “self-managed learning”, “experiential learning”, “incidental/accidental learning”, “situated learning”, “learning through socialization” or “tacit learning”. Those diverse types of “informal learning” supplement each other rather than compete against.

    "abstract": "Decision-making capacity refers to the ability to make a specific decision. Making a valid decision requires understanding the facts presented, appreciating the nature of the decision to be made, mentally manipulating the information rationally, and communicating the decision. The complexity of the decision is a major determinate of how difficult it is to make the decision. Physiologic changes with aging, psychological changes, medication effects, and clinical syndromes, particularly dementia, common in aging all can affect decision-making ability. Clinicians are often required to assist in determining decision-making capacity, and many instruments have been developed to assist in this determination. Common categories of decisions include ability to consent to or refuse medical or psychiatric treatment, ability to decide to remain living at home instead of a more institutional setting, capacity to sign contracts, wills, or make other financial decisions, capacity to consent to sexual relations or marry, and capacity to consent to research. Factors that can complicate determination of decision-making include fluctuating levels of cognitive functioning from delirium, difficulty processing or producing speech in aphasia, and external factors that produce undue influence.",

It is linked to the ethical principle of autonomy and to a collaborative and supporting doctor-patient relationship, far from the ancient paternalistic model. Mental capacity can be evaluated in clinical settings (decision-making to consent to treatment or research), for the autonomy in daily life activities (financial matters, contracts), and in criminal forensic settings (competence to stand trial, criminal responsibility). Decisional capacity evaluations must always be contextualized, as skills and knowledges needed for specific competencies are context dependent and specific to the function or activity being evaluated. Unstructured evaluations have proven to be unreliable, especially when assessing patients whose cognitive functioning is neither completely intact, nor totally compromised. To overcome this issue, several tools have been developed, aimed at guiding and supporting the forensic evaluator when assessing decisional capacity. A proper balance between personal care and collective interest must be found in the application of legal instruments that can limit personal freedom.",

    "abstract": "Scholars generally associate intelligence with cognitive, academic, or mathematical-logical competence.Scholastic Aptitude Tests, GPA, ACT, GMAT, GRE, and other admission tests are considered as surrogates of cognitive intelligence.Although academic institutions offer programs that are associated with this intelligence, literature on management generally acknowledges the inadequacy of cognitive intelligence as a predictor of one's success in life or effective leadership.Literature on management and administration generally ignored the contribution of noncognitive intelligence, such as emotional, social, and cultural that are necessary for successful leadership in management and administration.My comments here are on social intelligence (SI) that is essential for healthcare professionals (HCPs) who provide services to the patients.These professionals are trained to maintain and/or restore physical, mental, or psychological health of the patients.The thesis of this essay is that HCPs must have social intelligence to be effective in their jobs.SI is defined as the ability to be aware of relevant social situational contexts; to deal with the contexts or challenges effectively; to understand others' concerns, feelings, and emotional states; and to speak in a clear and convincing manner that involves knowing what to say, when to say it, and how to say it and to build and maintain positive relationships with others.This definition consists of four categories of abilities-situational awareness, situational response, cognitive empathy, and social skills.Situational awareness is associated with one's ability to collect data and information for the diagnosis and formulation of problem(s), and situational response is associated with one's ability to use this information to make effective decisions to attain desired results.These two basic abilities or competencies are needed for one's success in life or effective leadership.Cognitive empathy and social skills are needed for better understanding the feelings and needs of people, to communicate with them effectively, and to build and maintain relationships.These two abilities can help HCPs to remain aware of various social situational contexts which, in turn, help them to improve their situational response competence.These two abilities mediate the relationship between situational awareness and situational response.The theoretical basis of the four-category nomenclature of the SI construct is described as follows. Situational AwarenessThis is associated with one's ability to comprehend or assess relevant HC situations.HCPs must be very strong in this ability as it is needed to collect relevant information for effective HC from the internal and external environments and make appropriate diagnosis of the strengths, opportunities, weaknesses and threats in a timely manner.This ability enables a professional to formulate an HC problem correctly.",

Cognitive bias is a well-established psychological phenomenon.

There are four commonly used standards for competency: evidencing a choice in regard to research participation, factual understanding of the issues, rational manipulation of information, and appreciation of the nature of the situation. These standards can be arranged hierarchically such that each represents a stricter test of competency. The decision as to how rigorous a standard for competency is desirable cannot be made on psychiatric grounds. It requires consideration of the policy goals one hopes to attain.

The normative consequences of an incapacity-judgment in elderly care require a balanced approach, which takes into consideration the risk of misuse in the context of the justification of interventions that are applied without consent of the patient. In this article a number of central issues in the debate on decision-making capacity are discussed. The different criteria, which are proposed to assess capacity, are discussed as well as the development of instruments in order to objectify capacity. It is concluded that the common approach towards decision-making capacity, which is strongly cognitive-oriented, is inadequate. A number of relevant aspects remain underexposed within this approach. A broader approach is explored, which takes into account the role of emotions, identity, and dialogue and deliberation. The different approaches are illustrated by way of a case example.",

    "abstract": "Social intelligence plays an important role in the process of socialization and professional development of the individual in modern society. The problem of social intelligence is important for the teaching profession. Social intelligence requires the teacher to understand himself, behavior, actions and effective interaction of other people, as well as the development of knowledge, skills and abilities to achieve the goal. Social intelligence is a global ability formed on the basis of intellectual, personal, communicative and behavioral skills, providing the power of the process of self-regulation, which helps to predict the development of interpersonal situations, explain the readiness of the individual for social interaction and decision-making. The total number of scientists conducting research in this area is huge. Like many other scientific concepts, scientists cannot understand what social intelligence is. However, the urgency of the problem is largely due to insufficient study of the features of social intelligence of future teachers. On the other hand, the level of development of the teacher's social intelligence in Kazakhstan has not yet been studied. There have been practically no empirical studies on social intelligence in Russian psychological science. Despite the various methods available in foreign sources aimed at determining the level of intelligence, not all of them have been translated into Kazakh.",

    "title": "Board 90: Work in Progress: Response to Failure and Success in an ECE Course",
    "abstract": "Abstract In engineering as a profession and in engineering education, failure is commonplace--attempted designs fail, experiments fail about 90% of the time, and students do not achieve the scores they desire on homework, quizzes, and exams. Thus, the ability to navigate and respond to failure as an opportunity for growth and learning is a key component of the scientific enterprise. However, engineering education research is sparse on how students respond to failure. Research on response to failure has been extensive in workplace settings, in which there is a very wide range of negative and positive responses to failure, including denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance, working harder, working smarter, shock, fear, renewed dedication, increased susceptibility to stereotypes, blame, shame, despair, changes in interest, reassessing career, reassessing self-perceived ability, and learning from failure. Thus, these responses may include combinations of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses. Research on responses to success likewise suggests positive emotions in response to success on work projects, such as pride, satisfaction, and happiness. Educational research on response to failure across different domains and ages--not just in engineering education--has been quite narrow because research has used theories that make very narrow predictions about response to failure, like self-belief theory[1], achievement goal orientation[2], expectancy-value theory[3], interest theory[4], etc. Educational research on response to success has been sparse, but also suggests positive emotions in response to success. Our long-term goal is to find ways to help build resilience to failure and ways in which we can help students learn from failure (e.g., viewing failure as an opportunity), and hence it is critical to understand the range of responses to failure. Furthermore, to understand what response to failure looks like, we need to contrast it with response to success. Additionally, it is important to consider not only the standards of the course or the specific task (i.e., what counts as a failing score) but also the standards of the students. For instance, the same grade may be interpreted differently by two different students, one may see it as a success and the other may see it as a failure. Thus, it is critical to interview students to develop a better understanding of their response to their standard of failure or success. For this work-in-progress, we interviewed 26 students in a second year ECE course in a large public university, which is required for EE or CE majors, so we expect that students will see the course as important, and simultaneously put a great deal of grade pressure on themselves, making this an excellent test bed for measuring responses to failure and success in Engineering. Interviews focused on a) perceived success vs. perceived failure on the first exam, b) emotional responses to the first exam grade received, c) perceived reasons for that success or failure on the first exam, d) any additional study strategies used to study for the first exam, and e) plans--if any--to change study strategies for the second exam. We have completed the first-exam interviews and a motivation questionnaire, and applied a draft coding scheme derived from the interview statements to about one-half of the transcripts. Results so far are consistent with broader findings regarding emotions in formal learning--those who did better than expected verbalized a wide range of (almost all) positive emotions and those who did worse than expected verbalized a wide range of (almost all) negative emotions. Follow-up interviews after the second exam of the semester have begun, and will be transcribed, coded, and analyzed using the same coding scheme with codes added as warranted by additional student statements in the interviews. A Likert-type questionnaire will be written based on the coded interview responses. In addition, interview responses will be analyzed based on scores on various motivation scales (e.g., students valuing the content more may have more-negative responses to perceived failure versus those who value the content less).

    "title": "The teaching of thinking in Malaysia",
    "abstract": "The development of the intellectual potential and consequently the ability to think wisely has always been an important goal of education. This important landmark of an educated person is again raised today as a major issue in education, after many studies have begun to reveal symptoms of a decline in students' ability to think wisely, especially when schools began to focus on the mastery of facts, probably in the preparation for examinations rather than on the processes of arriving at those facts. The ability to think well is critical to an individual's success in life, especially in the age of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Globalization whereby individuals have to sieve through massive information, which might not be necessarily relevant at such a rapid pace, and the survival of industry and nation depends on competitive, knowledge capital. Should we teach thinking? Is it not a natural process and a matter of experience? After all, we were able to classify, analyze, generalize, deduce, induce, evaluate, make decisions and solve problems without any formal instructions in thinking. It is no longer true that being able to think spontaneously would lead to the ability to think effectively and wisely. Thinking could be taught and good thinking requires practice. Teachers in Malaysia are grappling with this issue in an effort to be forerunners in the country's drive to attain the status of an industrial country and a world centre of educational excellence. This work, therefore, examines the Malaysian educational policy regarding the teaching of thinking and studies that have been conducted in this area and their implications, in particular, for teacher education.",

    "title": "[Desire, knowledge..., belief, choice, ...and ability].",
    "abstract": "The evolution of various approaches to health education and additions from educational psychology have brought about a proposition of an easy-to-follow (thus useful) model for health educators based on five nouns: Desire, Knowledge, Belief, Choice, and Ability (Vouloir, Savoir, Se voir, Choisir et Pouvoir). 1. Desire creates the motivation which is essential to action, and can stem from: anticipating consequences; and/or an internal need to resolve problems; and/or external constraints; and/or an interest, reflecting a system of values. Motivation increases, of course, when more than one of the above factors comes into play and the effects are combined. 2. Knowledge is the cognitive competence which is acquired through direct experience, imitation of models, or \"verbal apprenticeship\" which provides the individual with a repertoire of effective solutions to various problems. 3. Belief concerns the concept of self-evaluation (or rather self-estime). An individual judges his/her capacity to act according to his/her capabilities, and the community according to its actual or potential human, financial and material resources. 4. An individual or community uses its \"knowledge\" to consider a series of possible solutions to a given problem and chooses the solution according to a base of preferences. In health, as elsewhere, all actions have positive and negative consequences. An example can be found in the alcohol/tobacco area: a certain positive image of smoking and drinking has been portrayed in many socio-cultural environments, and educational campaigns have had a difficult time convincing the public of the negative consequences of these actions. It is thus not surprising that the \"balance\" of the decision continues toward substance abuse. 5. After \"desire, knowledge, belief and choice\" have filtered potential solutions, the decisive step is left: the individual and/or community execute an action according to their ability to succeed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "title": "Psychologically Literate by Design: Four Case Study Undergraduate Modules that Centre Psychological Literacy",
    "abstract": "Psychological literacy is an approach to teaching which encourages students to consider their subject knowledge in ‘real world’ applied contexts (i.e. in student’s lives beyond university), which may be professional, personal, or societal. ‘Real world’ here refers to the application of psychological knowledge and skills to students’ personal, student-role, work, and community contexts. Psychological literacy is typically integrated into psychology programmes through classroom activities, extra-curricular activities, and opportunities outside of the core curriculum. However, for the goals of psychological literacy to be fully realised, it should be intentionally and thoughtfully embedded at the module and programme level. One way to achieve this is to develop and evaluate modules (i.e. standalone units or courses) that embed psychological literacy explicitly by design. In this paper, we provide overviews, brief evaluations, and reflections on four undergraduate modules within a UK Psychology (BSc) degree that integrate the principles of psychological literacy. These include a first-year compulsory module (‘Biological Approaches to Human and Non-Human Behaviour’), a second-year compulsory module (‘Neuroscience’) and two final-year elective optional modules (‘Face Perception’ and ‘Feminist Social Psychology’). We offer reflections on the process of designing these modules as educators who are interested in developing students’ psychological literacy and also provide student evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Social dysfunction of schizophrenia is observed in many domains including social skills, ability to conduct tasks, attention/durability, volition/motivation, stability of social life, and insight of dysfunction. These dysfunctions have been found to relate to non-social cognitive functioning to some extent. Social skills may have a strong relationship with social cognition. The intervention technique of cognitive functioning of schizophrenia, known as cognitive rehabilitation or cognitive remediation, has its main target as non-social cognition. Cognitive behavior therapy focuses on the contents of the cognitive process, while cognitive rehabilitation focuses on the cognitive process (information process) or thinking skills. Which cognitive functioning should be targeted was revealed as were theoretical models of cognitive rehabilitation, and various intervention techniques and their usefulness. It has been found that some elements of cognitive functioning, such as executive functioning, could be improved in experimental settings in efficacy studies. However, comprehensive rehabilitation including cognitive rehabilitation should be used in order to relieve social dysfunctioning or psychiatric symptoms. Some experts insisted that an individualized program with several steps, along with cognitive abilities, is required to enhance usefulness and effectiveness. Other experts said more complex cognitive functioning profoundly associated with social life should be targeted, rather than elementary cognitive functioning. The conclusions of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trails were not consistent until now, because inclusion criteria of meta-analysis was different. Finally, it was discussed how the theory and techniques of cognitive rehabilitation should be implemented in traditional rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "La neurodiversidad y determinados trastornos mentales pueden tener consecuencias en la igualdad de oportunidades y en la aceptación social. Un diagnóstico precoz puede mejorar la adaptación psicosocial y la calidad de vida. Sin embargo, para lograrlo, debemos vencer cierta reticencia profesional y ciudadana, justificada por el miedo a estigmatizar o patologizar conductas limítrofes con la normalidad. Educadores y profesionales de la salud no deberíamos dar por supuesto que pacientes y familiares comprenden el significado y el valor que aporta un buen diagnóstico a la calidad de vida. Demostrar la eficacia de las intervenciones basadas en evidencias puede allanar el camino a una mayor precisión y aceptación en el diagnóstico de trastornos mentales y del neurodesarrollo.",

Across cultures, concepts of mental health, as with GNH, include subjective well-being; perceived self-efficiency; autonomy; competence; inter-generational independence; and self-actualisation of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others. It is generally agreed that the concept of mental health is broader than a lack of mental disorders. Mental health must address the entire spectrum of issues affecting the mental well-being of all sectors of society.",

    "abstract": "Critical thinking is a way of life. It is learned, not taught. As such, educators at all levels must strive to provide students with opportunities to develop and practice these skills. This can be accomplished in many settings; however, active learning is an essential component of the complex mental process that results in the permanent integration. In research and medical practice alike, critical thinking skills allow the individual to consider all options, explore new approaches, and develop innovative solutions based on facts free from bias and dogma. Initiatives to develop critical thinking skills using active, investigative learning have been implemented at all levels of science education. Continuation of these efforts is essential to the development of the scientific critical thinking skills required in the medical and scientific community. Current research suggests that critical thinking skills measured with a standardized exam may not correlate with medical student performance on standardized subject exams in physiology. These results suggest that critical thinking skills may differ between subjects, and/or skills not measured by the critical thinking exam are required for successful application in this setting. Additional research is required to more accurately define how to best facilitate the acquisition, application, and assessment of scientific critical thinking skills.

    "abstract": "All people have the ability to adapt to different life circumstances.But everyone adapts to the conditions not in the same way, but in a unique way.Some people easily adapt to any situation, even in non-standard difficult situations, they leave the past and focus on the future, move forward, develop, experience spiritual satisfaction; while some are focused on the past and act within a limited framework -within the framework of fears, prohibitions, permissions, obligations, strict rules, and lead themselves to moral collapse.Such differences in adaptation are the result of complications and successes caused by certain developed and underdeveloped abilities in the human psyche that help and hinder overcoming obstacles.The manifestation of the situation formed by these abilities is revealed in the form of feeling, behavior, emotion, thought, speech, which are indicators of the inner world of a person.A psycholinguistic analysis was conducted on the basis of speech, which is one of the forms of manifestation mentioned in the article, i.e. on the basis of language units that create the psychological portrait of the character in the speech, attention was paid to the pronouns from the language units that create the psychological portrait of the character.The existence of consciousness closes the possibilities of a person's unlimited development.Therefore, the development of consciousness leads to greater demarcation of the individual.And supremacy is not surrendering to consciousness, but breaking the boundaries created by consciousness.This means the emergence of mental health.As the psyche is not only made up of consciousness, mental health is formed as a result of the evolution of the psyche in a person.Mental processes provide health and disease just as they provide human existence and life.Thus, a person without a psyche is not an individual, and an individual who cares about his consciousness is an individual with a mental disorder.An individual who can control his consciousness and develop pre-consciousness is an individual who has gained mental health.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper concentrates on the metacognitve aspects of materials produced by the Cognitive Acceleration through Science Education project. A set of activities for promoting higher level thinking skills in adolescents emphasises the development of metacognitive understanding of the reasoning patterns students use to solve problems. (Other psychological elements built into activities were focussed on the reasoning patterns of formal operations, the use of cognitive conflict, and conscious effort to make transfer from the activity content to wider contexts.) Examples are given, and the long term results following a two year trial reported. Although it is not possible to isolate statistically the specific contribution of encouragement of metacognition to the gains in cognitive development in science which were demonstrated, it is argued that the children's development of the ability to think about the nature of their own thinking was a critical contributor to success, without which the effectiveness of other aspects of the activities could not have been realised.",

Some experts try to formulate the definition of intelligence, including those who understand that intelligence is the ability to solve problems correctly which is relatively faster compared to the biological age. Intelligence is also interpreted as the ability to solve problems or create a valuable product in a cultural background or more. Intelligence is also understood as the ability to capture new situations and the ability to learn from one's past experiences. Intelligence depends on the context, tasks and demands raised by life and does not depend on IQ scores, degrees from universities or prestigious reputations. Thus what is meant by emotional intelligence is the ability of a person to understand and regulate the mood so as not to paralyze the clarity of rational brain thinking, but is able to display several skills, both personal skills and interpersonal skills.

Yet, there are times when acting quickly and without thinking may seem desirable, even adaptive. With the possible exception of intelligence, no other personality dimension or trait so broadly influences various areas of human endeavor: interpersonal relationships, education, fiscal responsibility, personal moral behavior, business ethics and entrepreneurship, aggression, and criminality. This chapter gives an overview of impulsivity from a personality theory perspective. Topics discussed include the historical development of the construct, the place of impulsivity in a broader personality theory, self-report and behavioral assessment, and the role of impulsiveness in impulse control disorders.",

In this review, we describe the concepts defined in the disablement process model of Verbrugge and Jette [Soc Sci Med 1994;38:1–14] and show how they apply to dementia. The main pathway leads from pathology to impairments, functional limitations and disability. Pathologies (any cause of dementia) are expressed by impairments in specific cognitive processes. Functional limitations are limitations in generic cognitive tasks such as remembering a list of words or orientating oneself in time and space. They are responsible for disability in activities of daily living. Predisposing risk factors as well as introduced intraindividual and extraindividual factors speed up or slow down the main pathway. We show how the model can help in understanding the functional consequences of dementia, for better assessment and management of demented subjects.",

    "title": "Fostering and Measuring Skills: Improving Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Skills to Promote Lifetime Success",
    "abstract": "This paper reviews the recent literature on measuring and boosting cognitive and non-cognitive skills. The literature establishes that achievement tests do not adequately capture character skills: personality traits, goals, motivations, and preferences that are valued in the labor market, in school, and in many other domains. Their predictive power rivals that of cognitive skills. Reliable measures of character have been developed. All measures of character and cognition are measures of performance on some task. In order to reliably estimate skills from tasks, it is necessary to standardize for incentives, effort, and other skills when measuring any particular skill. Character is a skill, not a trait.At any age, character skills are stable across different tasks, but skills can change over the life cycle. Character is shaped by families, schools, and social environments. Skill development is a dynamic process, in which the early years lay the foundation for successful investment in later years. High-quality early childhood and elementary school programs improve character skills in a lasting and cost-effective way. Many of them beneficially affect later-life outcomes without improving cognition. There are fewer long-term evaluations of adolescent interventions, but workplace-based programs that teach character skills are promising. The common feature of successful interventions across all stages of the life cycle through adulthood is that they promote attachment and provide a secure base for exploration and learning for the child. Successful interventions emulate the mentoring environments offered by successful families.",

    "title": "Psycho-social congruences between resilience and solitude",
    "abstract": "People always interact and accumulate experience. The experience makes us stronger, more resilient by knowing our resources, developing constructive behaviors for potentially traumatic situations. The ability to face unfortunate events (losses, traumas, crises, disability, continuous stress, etc.) is the resilience that we all possess, that state to recover and move on, to face challenges and overcome difficulties in a positive and resilient way. How we develop our individual psychological resilience is determined by a multitude of factors: our ability to adapt to change, accept change and continue to interact positively socially, by the individual tools we use in adverse situations, by social support network, contextual social factors, etc. Resilience and loneliness can be interconnected in several ways. While resilience refers to an individual's ability to bounce back or recover from adversity, solitude refers to the assumed and conscious state of being alone with oneself in a willful, not accidental, way. Solitude provides individuals with a space to engage in cognitive processing and problem solving. When alone, people can focus their attention on complex problems or stressful situations, allowing them to analyze the situation, generate potential solutions, and make decisions without external distractions. This cognitive processing and problem-solving capacity can enhance resilience by helping individuals develop effective strategies to overcome challenges. Solitude can serve as a means of rest and recovery, which are essential components of resilience. Taking time for oneself, away from the demands of others, allows individuals to recharge their mental and emotional resources. This recharging of energy and restoration of well-being through solitude can contribute to an individual's ability to recover from stressors and setbacks. It is important to note that while solitude can be beneficial for resilience, excessive or prolonged isolation can have negative effects on mental health. It is essential to find a balance and ensure that individuals have access to social support networks, as human connection that also plays a significant role in building resilience.",

    "title": "Психолого-педагогические технологии преодоления смыслового барьера в учебном процессе",
    "abstract": "Introduction. In modern psychological and educational science various barriers are considered to be certain psychological obstacles preventing an individual from reaching a new level in problem solving and obstructing the implementation of ongoing activities, in particular, communication with others (e.g., cognitive barriers, learning barriers, communication barriers). Meaning barriers – a specific type of barriers – are interpreted as obstacles in meaning-making and meaning-revealing. The paper introduces a new approach to overcoming meaning barriers in the teacher-student interaction process.&#x0D; Theoretical Basis. In the learning process, which the modern theory of meaning defines as the process of transferring meanings between the teacher and the student, interpreting meaning barriers has its unique characteristics. In the teacher-student meaning interactions, the acceptance of meanings takes place at various levels. In so doing, meaning barriers may emerge as a subjective dissonance, as an obstacle to meaning-seeking activities and to the actualization of meanings at the level of awareness and meaning reflection. Meaning barriers in the learning process may differ from those in other contexts by their mechanisms, functions, and means that could be used to overcome them.&#x0D; Results. When analyzing the differentiation of meaning barriers in the learning process, the authors faced the necessity to search for both direct and indirect means of overcoming meaning barriers to learning, which could be instrumental in modeling learning situations in order to overcome meaning barriers in the actual practice of the learning process. The authors analyzed various technologies for meaning initiations, discovered their didactic effects and developing resources, and presented the experimental studies confirming the effectiveness of the suggested approach.&#x0D; Discussion. The analysis of various pedagogical technologies demonstrated their potential applicability for overcoming meaning barriers to learning.&#x0D; Highlights&#x0D; &#x0D; Psychological and pedagogical technologies for overcoming meaning barriers to learning are among the most topical directions for improving the learning process in modern education.&#x0D; Arising from learning activities, meaning barriers function as both constructive and destructive factors for such activities.&#x0D; The regulatory effect of meaning barriers blocks less effective learning strategies and redirects learners’ searching activities toward acquiring more effective strategies.&#x0D; The obtained results suggest the importance of developing technological ensuring for the framework of meanings in education.&#x0D;",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits are common after brain injury and can be measured in various ways. Many neuropsychological tests are designed to measure specific cognitive deficits, and self-report questionnaires capture cognitive complaints. Measuring cognition in daily life is important in rehabilitating the abilities required to undertake daily life activities and participate in society. However, assessment of cognition in daily life is often performed in a non-standardized manner. In this opinion paper we discuss the various types of assessment of cognitive functioning and their associated instruments. Drawing on existing literature and evidence from experts in the field, we propose a framework that includes seven dimensions of cognition measurement, reflecting a continuum ranging from controlled test situations through to measurement of cognition in daily life environments. We recommend multidimensional measurement of cognitive functioning in different categories of the continuum for the purpose of diagnostics, evaluation of cognitive rehabilitation treatment, and assessing capacity after brain injury.",

Many neuropsychological tests are designed to measure specific cognitive deficits, and self-report questionnaires capture cognitive complaints. Measuring cognition in daily life is important in rehabilitating the abilities required to undertake daily life activities and participate in society. However, assessment of cognition in daily life is often performed in a non-standardized manner. In this opinion paper we discuss the various types of assessment of cognitive functioning and their associated instruments. Drawing on existing literature and evidence from experts in the field, we propose a framework that includes seven dimensions of cognition measurement, reflecting a continuum ranging from controlled test situations through to measurement of cognition in daily life environments. We recommend multidimensional measurement of cognitive functioning in different categories of the continuum for the purpose of diagnostics, evaluation of cognitive rehabilitation treatment, and assessing capacity after brain injury.",

    "title": "The Necessity of Ambiguity in Self–Other Processing: A Psychosocial Perspective With Implications for Mental Health",
    "abstract": "While distinguishing between the actions and physical boundaries of self and other (non-self) is usually straightforward there are contexts in which such differentiation is challenging. For example, self-other ambiguity may occur when actions of others are similar or complementary to those of the self. Even in the absence of such situational challenges, individuals experiencing hallucinations have difficulties with this distinction, often experiencing thoughts or actions of self as belonging to other agents. This paper explores the role of ambiguity in self-other differentiation, drawing from developmental, psychodynamic and neurocognitive perspectives. A key proposal is that engagement in contexts that make distinctions between self and other challenging yet necessary allow reality-testing skills related to agency to develop. Attunement in typical caregiver-infant interactions is framed as a safe but inherently ambiguous environment that provides optimal condition for the infant to develop a coherent self-other sense. Vulnerability to psychosis may be related to limited access to such an environment in early development. However, the perceptual, cognitive and social skills that contribution to attribution are likely to be malleable following infancy and improve though opportunities for boundary play in similarly ambiguous settings. Using music-making to illustrate, we postulate that engagement in intricate joint-actions that blurs agentic boundaries can contribute to the continued development of an adaptive sense of self and other essential to healthy social functioning. Increased insight into the self-other ambiguity may enhance our understanding of mechanisms underlying 'self-disorders' such as schizophrenia and eventually extend the range of social and arts-based therapeutic possibilities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Shyness as an emotional state is considered by some researchers to be universal, a blend of fear and interest, and adaptive in evolution. Shyness as a personality trait may be defined experientially as excessive self‐focus characterized by negative self‐evaluation that creates discomfort or inhibition in social situations and interferes with pursuing one's interpersonal or professional goals. The experience of shyness can occur at any or all of the following levels: cognitive (e.g., excessive negative self‐evaluation), affective (e.g., heightened negative emotion), physiological (e.g., racing heart), and behavioral (e.g., failure to respond appropriately). It may be triggered by a wide variety of situational cues. Among the most typical situations are interactions with authorities and strangers, one‐on‐one opposite‐sex interactions, and unstructured social settings.",

The features of ethnic tolerance of students with the prerequisites of professional deformities are revealed: low use of others as an example for imitation of forms of behavior and worldview positions; reduced tolerance to mental and physical discomfort caused by others; inability to control their unpleasant feelings caused by the low sociability of the interlocutors; moderate tolerance, in particular ethnic; reduced tolerance in interpersonal communication; below average degree of tolerance as a personal feature, as a component of effective communication; practical lack of desire to re-educate, remake others for themselves; reduced consideration of individual psychological characteristics of the interlocutors; low psychological flexibility in the process of evaluating others; reduced ability to adapt and forgive others. There is a noticeable relationship between: the average degree of severity of exhaustion of a psychoemotional nature and a reduced tolerance to mental and physical discomfort caused by others; the average level of general professional deformities and a low degree of severity of the use of others as an example for imitation of behaviors and worldview positions; average emotional exhaustion and a low level of ability to adapt and forgive others.",

    "title": "Hyperactivity Level: Development of a Nursing Outcome Label",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE To develop a nursing outcome label for the concept of hyperactivity. METHODS Using concept analysis of an exhaustive review of the nursing and related literatures — including psychology, pediatrics, and general medicine—the NOC Psychological/Cognitive Focus Group constructed a conceptual definition for Hyperactivity Level and delineated the indicators. The group identified pertinent data from the literature and clustered the data into the predetermined categories of conceptual definition and indicators. FINDINGS Results included a conceptual definition for Hyperactivity Level label: the severity of patterns of inattention or impulsivity in children, and a list of 23 indicators that reflect all dimensions of the outcome Hyperactivity Level. ▪ Inattention ▪ Lack of active listening ▪ Difficulty organizing tasks ▪ Inability to stay “on task” ▪ Lack of follow-through or completion of activities ▪ Difficulty with tasks that require sustained mental effort ▪ Careless mistakes ▪ Frequently loses things, excessive distractibility, excessive forgetfulness ▪ Impulsivity, excessive fidgeting, inability to remain seated ▪ Excessive running and/or climbing ▪ Excessive motor behavior ▪ Difficulty playing quietly ▪ Excessive talking ▪ Blurts out answers before the question is completed ▪ Difficulty awaiting turn ▪ Excessive interrupting of others; intrusive, abrasive, loud, interpersonal interactions ▪ Inappropriate aggressive behavior ▪ Difficulty in keeping hands to self CONCLUSIONS While most people do not outgrow ADHD, people can learn to control hyperactivity urges and live satisfying lives. Using combinations of medication, new behavior skills, and emotional support, people with ADHD can develop ways to control their attention and minimize their disruptive behaviors. With the skills of the nurse as well as support from parents, teachers, and other healthcare providers, children with ADHD are better prepared to manage their hyperactivity and channel it into more socially acceptable behaviors. By using selected nursing outcomes and interventions, the child can improve his self-esteem through the development of self-control.",

In learning psychology the well-known concept of transfer of knowledge implies precisely that students and learners are often unable to activate what they have learned in relevant situations that are different from the learning situation. Workplace learning is increasingly shaped by the sort of fluid experience, but it needs to be made explicit. Competences are also concerned with learning, developing and improving, but always starting at the level and position one has already reached. As to how the competence developmental processes can be thought of and arranged as learning courses on the social and individual levels, some guidelines can be drawn from the special qualities of competences in combination with learning theoretical and educational considerations.",

The cognitive domains of general intellectual function, memory, language, visuospatial, and visuoperceptual processing, praxis, executive function, and processing speed are explored, and specific tests and strategies involved in their assessment are highlighted. Three detailed case studies of individuals with posterior cortical atrophy, semantic dementia, and functional cognitive disorders are presented. The psychological impact of cognitive dysfunction and how neuropsychological evaluation can contribute not only to diagnosis and prognosis but also to management of the personal and practical ramifications of a cognitive disorder are discussed.",

(1990) consider that self-esteem is the emotional result of an ever-changing collection of accurate and/or inaccurate assessments one continually makes of oneself. These assessments are based on the way one views oneself (self-image) and thinks about oneself (self-concept) relative to numerous personal characteristics such as physical appearance, personality traits, status in various groups and the like. It is therefore advisable for any self-esteem programme for children to include elements which address both self-image and self-concept.",

However, there are a variety of cognition models used in discussions of teaching students to think. Those most represented are 1) approaches that involve global constructs of thinking (e.g., \"analysis\") in a progression (e.g., from \"knowledge\" to \"synthesis\"); 2) approaches that address strategies for learning or problem solving; 3) approaches that employ a psychological or epistemological model of human development; and 4) approaches that address thinking skills that are regarded as generic, functional in all higher-order thinking. The boundaries are fluid, none is complete, and each raises questions. Summed up, the models carry common principles—students may function adequately without higher order thinking and grades generally should not be equated with quality of thinking. Also, active and social learning are preferred.",

Reified in many popular tests, it has withstood onslaughts from factor analysis, from concerned social scientists, from judicial fiat, and from scientific knowledge about mental abilities, brain functions, and neuropathology. In neuropsychological practice its use - and that of any scores representing sums or averages of disparate data obtained from tests of brain functions and mental abilities - can obscure specific facets of a subject's neuropsychological status or misrepresent it generally. This 70-year-old concept has outlived its usefulness. Neuropsychology needs to seek more appropriate alternatives to the IQ for describing and conceptualizing mental functioning.",

Theoretical is presented analysis of the semantic characteristics of the concept. Factors that prevent the formation of emotional regulation of communicative behavior in situations of communicative interaction are considered. Among them are the following: unformed subjective experience of emotional relationships; frequent deprivation; affective reactions of irritability, tearfulness, euphoria, anxiety; poverty and insufficient differentiation of experiences; immaturity of the emotional sphere; difficulties of emotional adaptation; violation of emotional comfort and mental balance; reduction of general activation indicators; frequent ups and downs of mood; manifestations of inflammation; inability to respond to events with a flexible range of emotions; spontaneity and uncontrollability of reactions; low level of self-regulation of emotional states; delay in the formation of higher emotional feelings; difficulty understanding other people’s emotional states. The state of emotional support of communication in adolescents with special needs is analyzed. The competencies that need to be formed in schoolchildren with intellectual disabilities are singled out and substantiated. Certain provisions prove the feasibility of using the following areas of psychological influence: increase the overall activation indicators of communication; learning to provide for their basic needs in order to avoid a state of deprivation; developing the ability to respond to events with a flexible range of emotions; increasing control overemotional reactions and the level of self-regulation of emotional states; overcoming outbreaks of aggression and emotional-affective reactions of explosiveness, inflammation; reducing the level of anxiety; increasing the differentiation of experiences; learning to understand other people’s emotional states; overcoming the tendency to take offense at others; learning to achieve emotional comfort and mental balance; formation of higher emotional feelings; optimization of social feelings; formation of subjective experience of emotional relations. It is determined that the described competencies are strategic determinants that contribute to improving the quality of interpersonal relationships and communication.",

Self-concept and related \nprocesses are also frequently posited as a mediating variable that facilitates the \nattainment of other desired outcomes. In education, for example, research sug­\ngests that the attainment of a positive academic self-concept affects academic \nbehaviors, academic choices, educational aspirations, and subsequent academic \nachievement. It is also likely that intervention programs that successfully pro­\nduce short-term changes in skills and aptitudes will not have long-term effects \nunless there are concomitant changes in corresponding areas of self-concept.",

    "title": "Game On: Assessing the Therapeutic Benefits of Board Games in Schizophrenia Management",
    "abstract": "Introduction Schizophrenia is a complex psychotic disorder characterized by positive symptoms (such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech and behavior), negative symptoms, and cognitive impairment. Cognitive deficits, including impairments in executive function, memory, and social cognition, are particularly persistent and significantly impact daily functioning and overall quality of life. While cognitive remediation has proven effective, recent research has explored the potential of board games as a therapeutic tool. Objectives This study aims to assess the therapeutic benefits of board games on cognitive function, specifically executive function, in patients with schizophrenia. Methods A literature review was conducted using articles from PubMed, focusing on the terms “board game”, “schizophrenia” and “cognition”. Results Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia contribute significantly to poor functional outcomes and daily functioning. Improving cognitive function and social behaviors has been a major focus of psychiatric rehabilitation techniques. Board games have been found to improve various aspects of cognitive function, including attention, working memory, speed of processing, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, as well as social cognition. They are expected to enhance knowledge, interpersonal interactions, and increase participant motivation. Ideally, an effective board game for this population should be behaviorally oriented, emphasize positive reinforcement and shaping, and be sensitive to cognitive limitations through repetition and procedural learning. Additionally, they should be engaging and fun to address negative symptoms. Conclusions Board games present a promising therapeutic avenue for managing schizophrenia, particularly in enhancing cognitive function and social skills. While cognitive remediation programs have already demonstrated efficacy, board games offer a more accessible and engaging alternative. Despite these positive findings, the limited number of studies and inconsistent long-term data highlight the need for further research. Future studies should evaluate the durability of cognitive and functional improvements from board game interventions and explore their integration into comprehensive treatment programs for schizophrenia.

    "title": "Twenty questions about student errors",
    "abstract": "Abstract Errors in science learning (errors in expression of organized, purposeful thought within the domain of science) provide a window through which glimpses of mental functioning can be obtained. Errors are valuable and normal occurrences in the process of learning science. A student can use his/her errors to develop a deeper understanding of a concept as long as the error can be recognized and appropriate, informative feedback can be obtained. A safe, non‐threatening, and nonpunitive environment which encourages dialogue helps students to express their conceptions and to risk making errors. Pedagogical methods that systematically address common student errors produce significant gains in student learning. Just as the nature‐nurture interaction is integral to the development of living things, so the individual‐environment interaction is basic to thought processes. At a minimum, four systems interact: (1) the individual problem solver (who has a worldview, relatively stable cognitive characteristics, relatively malleable mental states and conditions, and aims or intentions), (2) task to be performed (including relative importance and nature of the task), (3) knowledge domain in which task is contained, and (4) the environment (including orienting conditions and the social and physical context). Several basic assumptions underlie research on errors and alternative conceptions. Among these are: Knowledge and thought involve active, constructive processes; there are many ways to acquire, organize, store, retrieve, and think about a given concept or event; and understanding is achieved by successive approximations. Application of these ideas will require a fundamental change in how science is taught.",

It is rooted in psychology and neuroscience and is developed through self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, social skills, and intrinsic motivation. EI is influenced by cognitive and neurological mechanisms, such as the amygdala's function in processing emotions and the prefrontal cortex's adaptability. EI is assessed using various tools, such as self-report questionnaires and multisource feedback instruments. To develop EI, individuals and organizations can use strategies like mindfulness practices and empathetic listening drills, as presented in this study. EI has transformative potential in personal and professional contexts, affecting leadership, teamwork, and organizational dynamics. However, barriers such as cultural and societal influences and personal resistance to change can hinder the journey to EI mastery.",

    "abstract": "Social cognition focuses on the mental processes involved in social interactions. In the participatory planning process, which puts into use the knowledge and skills of individuals through active interaction, the study of social cognitive abilities seems relevant. The objective of this article is to review the social cognitive factors and their implications in participatory planning and designing. Social cognitions are observed early in childhood and they develop over decades through experience. It appears that they are partially independent of formal intelligence. The existing data suggests that social cognition may have a biological basis in the form of neurophysiological substrates and genetic loci. Social cognitions help in comprehending, adjusting interpretations, thinking of multiple alternatives, social problem solving and in various other processes. Social cognitions are instrumental in dealing with a variety of interpersonal problems observed during interactions in the group and in coping with potential stressors like negative outcomes. Various factors like positive mood states, belief in self-efficacy and goals may affect social cognition and planning and decision-making processes. These findings suggest that practitioners and researchers of participatory change processes should pay attention to social cognition.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical analysis of the concept of helplessness has been done in the article; psychological peculiarities of interrelations between helplessness and self-esteem have been disclosed; and it has been found out that emergence of learned helplessness depends on a self-esteem level that may change in the process of solving issues of different complexity. Low self-esteem is one of the main factors of helplessness formation of a personality. Personality with lowered self-esteem feels humiliation and helplessness that may confuse, looks uncertain, self-accuses even in such situations where own guilt may not be there, almost always looks anxious, even sometimes it may lead to neurotic behavior. People with such level of self-esteem do not set a goal that will be difficult to achieve, they are limited to solving everyday easyt tasks, but at the same time they seem to be too critical to themselves. One of the main ways to overcome helplessness are: formation of adequate self-esteem, feeling of own dignity, success experience, self-control, formation of responsibility for the action taken, etc. Thanks to such achievements a personality can not only get rid of the feeling of helplessness, but also learn how to better interact with society, to achieve success both in personal life and in professional activity.",

Research across multiple domains of psychology shows that our “free” choices, preferences, motives, and social behavior are all shaped by these unconscious operations. They arise from various sources, including (1) evolved primary motives for survival and safety, (2) early childhood experiences for which there is later no explicit memory; (3) carryover (priming) effects of experiences from one situation into the next; and (4) the transformational impact of our active goals on attention, preferences, and behavior. These effects have now been demonstrated in many real-life settings, including eating and health behavior, consumer purchasing, and teamwork and individual performance in the workplace, with unconscious effects in the field significantly stronger than those in the lab.",

    "title": "How Social Psychological Factors May Modulate Auditory and Cognitive Functioning During Listening",
    "abstract": "The framework for understanding effortful listening (FUEL) draws on psychological theories of cognition and motivation. In the present article, theories of social-cognitive psychology are related to the FUEL. Listening effort is defined in our consensus as the deliberate allocation of mental resources to overcome obstacles in goal pursuit when carrying out a task that involves listening. Listening effort depends not only on hearing difficulties and task demands but also on the listener’s motivation to expend mental effort in challenging situations. Listeners’ cost/benefit evaluations involve appraisals of listening demands, their own capacity, and the importance of listening goals. Social psychological factors can affect a listener’s actual and self-perceived auditory and cognitive abilities, especially when those abilities may be insufficient to readily meet listening demands. Whether or not listeners experience stress depends not only on how demanding a situation is relative to their actual abilities but also on how they appraise their capacity to meet those demands. The self-perception or appraisal of one’s abilities can be lowered by poor self-efficacy or negative stereotypes. Stress may affect performance in a given situation and chronic stress can have deleterious effects on many aspects of health, including auditory and cognitive functioning. Social support can offset demands and mitigate stress; however, the burden of providing support may stress the significant other. Some listeners cope by avoiding challenging situations and withdrawing from social participation. Extending the FUEL using social-cognitive psychological theories may provide valuable insights into how effortful listening could be reduced by adopting health-promoting approaches to rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. The article hopes to provide a theoretical analysis of research papers dedicated to the way various uncertainty effects influence personality development. The uncertainty phenomenon has to be considered due to the research field enhancement while elaborating adequate patterns of personality development meaning regulation. Theoretical Basis. Uncertainty effects are revealed epistemically and ontologically in the objective sphere, and existentially and phenomenologically in the subjective sphere. Results. Epistemically uncertainty effects are a changeable level of cognitive reflection; continuity of certainty and uncertainty; ambiguous, incomplete and insufficient information; lack of human knowledge about human abilities; disregard for casualties and anomalies; blurred and multiple current psychological paradigms. Ontologically uncertainty effects are relativity of existence; development points with equal probability; a chance of synergistic effect; different human abilities of achieving goals within their existence; aspiration to gain new personal experience; different susceptibility to development pathway deviations. Existentially uncertainty effects are the absence of well-defined external clues in search of life purpose; personality development crises; discrepancy in tolerance levels towards uncertainty; discrepancy in credibility levels towards the world; nonidentity of individuals’ personal experiences; different ideas of action purposes; discrepancy in contradiction levels of interaction between an individual and the society; an unbalanced combination of rational and emotional perception; impossibility of permanent psychological comfort. Phenomenologically uncertainty effects are success and failure expectation risks; different motivation levels; “learned helplessness”; learning interferences due to implicit knowledge; lack of time for reflection over decisions; a subconscious phase of decision making; conscious and subconscious meaning attribution. Discussion. An individual has to act under the influence of many uncertainty effects. Taking this into consideration allows a more full-fledged theoretical and empiric study of personality development processes.",

    "abstract": "A life filled with learning is advisable. Tasks involving some degree of cognitive complexity is desirable, but there is no reason to believe that certain forms of learning are better than others. What is critical is that the activity needs to be consistent and persistent. Involvement of cognitive activity at work is important and jobs that involve high stress, passive participation, and lack of complexity are associated with higher levels of cognitive impairment in later life. There is also no reason to believe that mental activities must be limited to the early years of life. People are able to learn at all ages and participation in learning is valuable for the brain throughout life. The concept of diversity refers as well to learning and mental activities. It is good to learn new things! Participation in cognitive activities throughout the lifespan both at home and at work and avoiding multi-tasking can help build cognitive reserve capacity. Cognitive activities directly impair disease processes. Being cognitively active and paying attention to the world helps to protect the brain from free radicals and toxins. Cognitive activities also assists in the management of stress.",

Integrity arises when intentions, words, thoughts, and actions align and there is fidelity in adherence to ethical commitments, norms, and conscience. It includes a robust notion of moral agency that includes considerations of the congruence of intentions, character, choices, behavior, and actions as well as responsibility for them. It requires a well-honed conscience; moral sensitivity, perception, and imagination; self-regulatory capacities; ongoing reflection to evaluate one’s intentions, motivations, and actions; cognitive judgement; the ability to devise reasonable solutions to internal conflicts; and steadfast commitment to responsibly enact considered decisions. clinicians have dual obligations to those served and to themselves. Personal and relational integrity are fundamental considerations for clinicians. This dynamic interplay requires attunement to the issues of personal and relational integrity that are at play in clinical practice including relationships with patients, families, colleagues, leaders, organizations and the broader society.",

    "title": "FEATURES OF STUDENTS’ PROCRASTINATION",
    "abstract": "Abstract. The article carries out a theoretical and methodological analysis of the phenomenon of procrastination. In psychology, procrastination is understood as a constant postponement and non-fulfillment of planned tasks. It is different from a simple correction of plans or laziness. A person is well aware that non-fulfillment of certain cases can have negative consequences (non-fulfillment at all, late execution, excessive extra effort for deadlines, condemnation of relatives, lack of sleep), however. Again and again a person postpones it. That is why procrastination is often accompanied by various negative emotional states: guilt, anxiety, discomfort, a sense of inability to control the situation. Procrastination is usually manifested in activities, the result of which is very important for the individual. Students have all kinds of procrastination, but academic procrastination is the most common. Most often studentsʼs procrastination occurs in situations that involve intellectual stress, require self-organization and activity planning, with deferred remuneration, not sufficiently motivated. The classic of academic procrastination is to prepare for the exam on the last day, to write a term paper the day before the defense, or even to write it at night. Chronic procrastination is characteristic of students who have chosen the wrong specialty and the wrong educational institution, so they study without interest and try to complete educational tasks on the last day. In addition, such students show an inability to organize their activities, forgetfulness, general behavioral rigidity. There are the factors that cause procrastination in the studentʼs environment. They are psychological, socio-psychological, pedagogical and psychophysiological factors. An empirical study has shown that procrastination is common to all students, but manifests in varies degrees. There are some causes of procrastination that the students indicated. They are inability to plan, lack of time, lack of motivation, fatigue, health, too many tasks, uninteresting tasks, lack of willpower, the presence of other important tasks. It should be said that both groups with a low level of procrastination and with a high level of procrastination there are students who have a positive attitude to procrastination. They see the benefit of procrastination, explaining that they have time to have a rest, time to find more effective way to achieve a desired result, thus considering procrastination a natural state of reduced activity. In the group of students with a low level of procrastination the success rate is higher than in the groups of students with medium and high levels of procrastination. In the group of students with a low level of procrastination there is a high overall ability to self-regulate. High self-regulation of laziness is a characteristic of students with low levels of procrastination.",

    "abstract": "Design Thinking is often referred to as a valuable addition for educational models to promote a way of learning that encourages collaborations with people who work, think and act differently. Despite being used in multiple situations and described by numerous lists with characteristics, little is known about how it could affect people’s lives beyond the professional environment. The Capability Approach was used as an inspiration to explore with designers how it has influenced their lives through an interactive installation and in-depth interviews. Respondents reported better imagination, reasoning, thinking, using of skills and talents, freedom of expression, and ability to imagine another’s situation as a result of their designerly attitude. It is argued that integrating design thinking in educational models potentially transforms how people interact in society.",

    "title": "Dynamics of Intellectual Confidence in Problem Solving",
    "abstract": "Background. The problem of criteria for evaluating solution success is one of the most important for psychology of creative thinking. Evaluation of the solution by the subject during the process of thinking in the form of «confidence / doubt» can be criteria and basis for subject's experiencing potential success or failure, which leads to continuation or stop in solving. The objective. The study was to research the dynamics of intellectual confidence / doubt at different stages of problem-solving process. Sample. The study involved 66 university students, specialists and non- specialists in relation to the content of the tasks. Methods. The subjects solved 8 problematic tasks of scientific and artistic content with hints and estimate interest and confidence at different stages of solving with subjective scales. The following methods were used for intellectual characteristics: \"Raven's Progressive Matrices\", \"Complex Analogies\". Results. 6 types of dynamics of intellectual confidence were identified, which correlated in various ways with the success of the solution. Successful solution of problematic scientific situations for specialists is associated with confidence at every stage, for non-specialists it is associated with doubts at the stages of understanding the problem and the formulation of solution. For problematic situations of artistic content solved by non-specialist, the following types of dynamics are associated with successful solution: «doubt — doubt — confidence», «confidence at all stages»; the latter was also observed with an unsuccessful solution. For this reason 2 types of confidence were identified: (1) reasonable, based on hints, leading to a successful solution, and (2) non- reasonable, without relying on a hint, not leading to a successful solution. Conclusion. The procedural criteria to evaluate solution are the intellectual emotions of confidence or doubt that regulate the process of thinking. Depending on the stage of solution and the content of the task, intellectual confidence changes in different ways for specialists and non-specialists, performing the function of a preliminary assessment and regulation of solving process.",

These skills take the form of exceptional musical, artistic or mechanical abilities, prodigious memorization or mathematical talents, and most commonly, the ability to calculate with rapidity the day of the week upon which any given date, past or future, falls. Reported throughout much of this century as objects of amazement, and familiar through the popular press to the general public, there has been a recent surge in experimental studies attempting to describe components of the development of savant abilities, and to determine mental processes used to accomplish these tasks. This survey examines the psychological aspects of the savant syndrome, focusing on the means by which certain abilities, particularly calendar calculation, are accomplished, and highlighting variables postulated as important for development of the syndrome. Implications for the education of students with intellectual and developmental disabilities are discussed, including the relevance of this literature to theories of general intelligence.",

Many older adults, aware of such cognitive changes, seek ways to bolster their cognitive functioning. Evidence based on the cognitive aging literature supports a number of factors associated with cognitive functioning. These factors include physical exercise, intellectual exercise, nutrition, sleep hygiene, social interaction, and mood and emotional state. These factors can be manipulated and woven together by nurses and other health professionals to develop an easy-to-use, non-invasive cognitive prescription for improving the cognitive health of older adults. An example and directions for developing and implementing cognitive prescriptions are described.",

    "title": "Procrastination as the Important Problem in Modern Psychology",
    "abstract": "The aim of our research is to show psychological peculiarities of procrastination as the important problem in Modern Psychology, to describe the results of our research of the level of procrastination of teenagers. Methods of the research. The following theoretical methods of the research were used to solve the tasks formulated in the article: a categorical method, structural and functional methods, the methods of the analysis, systematization, modeling, and generalization. The experimental method was the method of organizing empirical research. The results of the research. Respondents with a low level of procrastination are highly organized and efficient in completing tasks. They are usually able to plan their activities with precision and adhere to the planned schedule, which allow them to avoid procrastination and postponing tasks for later. This ability to complete tasks in time is the result of well-developed time management skills, organization, and self-discipline. Pupils with a low level of procrastination are able to tune into completing tasks, even if they require significant effort or difficulties arise. They can also work effectively under stress, when they are affected by several tasks at once. Conclusions. Procrastination, as a multifactorial psychological phenomenon, has come a long way from a simple understanding as laziness to the modern interpretation as a complex psychological process. Its emergence and development are associated with the evolution of views on human behavior, motivation and internal conflicts. From ancient times to the present day, procrastination has been changed in its understanding, and today it is considered not only as a personal flaw, but as a problem that requires special attention and intervention.",

Whenever we are not able to rely on overlearned routines, we must concentrate on and continuously monitor our actions. This is not restricted to practical actions but holds equally well for every kind of social interaction and every kind of intellectual activity. In this sense, attentional functions can be considered as fundamental processes. When we are inattentive, 'unconcentrated', a number of things that go on around us escape our notice. We get distracted and digress, we do not remember details afterwards. Practical actions get difficult, and we make mistakes. Thus, impairments in attentional functions have far-reaching consequences for an individual's participation in almost every area of life, everyday activities, education, work, traffic, and nearly every other conceivable activity.",

Placed in situations in which we feel threatened, or which implicate our values, our brains, relying on those implicitly learned, emotionally weighted, memories, may react automatically, without reflection or the opportunity for reflective interdiction. We can downshift, to primitive, self-protective problem solving techniques. Because these processes operate below the radar of our consciousness, automatic, emotional reaction, rather than thoughtful, reasoned analysis may drive our responses to stressful questions of ethics and professional responsibility.",

    "abstract": "This study provides an empirical test of a previously proposed assertion that intelligence as adaptation has an attitudinal as well as an ability component. The ability component deals with what the basic knowledge and skills are that underlie intelligence, and how much of each one an individual has. The attitudinal component deals with how an individual chooses to deploy the abilities they have. In other words, to what use are the abilities put? It is argued that it is impossible fully to separate the measurement of the ability component from the attitudinal one. In a diverse population, even taking an intelligence test will show itself to involve an attitude toward the test, which may enhance or detract from performance, as when one sees the test as irrelevant or harmful to one’s life, or as a sociocultural misfit to one’s life experience. To succeed, people need not only to have abilities, but attitudes that put those abilities to effective use to accomplish individuals’ life goals. In the study, we found that intelligent attitudes are related, but non-identical, to germane constructs, such as wisdom, the need for cognition, creativity, and openness to experience. Scores on the attitudinal measure were not related to scores on tests of fluid intelligence and academic abilities/achievement. Thus, the range of attitudes regarding how to deploy intelligence can vary over ability levels.",

Celui-ci fait surgir des questions nouvelles pour lesquelles il n'existe pas encore de connaissances bien etablies, qu'il s'agisse de la dimension physiologique ou psychologique du vieillissement. En ce qui concerne la dimension psychologique, il est incontestable que le vieillissement s'accompagne d'une diminution des performances cognitives des sujets. Les modeles elabores depuis une dizaine d'annees en psychologie cognitive permettent a cette discipline d'etre particulierement bien avancee pour expliquer les deficits cognitifs. Cet ouvrage confirme la pertinence de deux approches explicatives, l'une globale, l'autre analytique. L'approche globale traite des effets du vieillissement sur la memoire de travail, l'attention, les fonctions d'execution et de controle. Sont examinees, dans l'approche analytique, la capacite de denomination, la comprehension et la memorisation d'enonces, la capacite de representation visuo-spatiale, la perception du temps ou encore la detection d'incongruites dans la perception d'un visage connu. Neanmoins, de nouvelles perspectives d'explication peuvent etre envisagees en invoquant des atteintes neurologiques ou des deficits sensoriels.",

    "title": "“The Unconscious” in Current Psychology",
    "abstract": "A series of vignette examples taken from psychological research on motivation, emotion, decision making, and attitudes illustrates how the influence of unconscious processes is often measured in a range of different behaviors. However, the selected studies share an apparent lack of explicit operational definition of what is meant by consciousness, and there seems to be substantial disagreement about the properties of conscious versus unconscious processing: Consciousness is sometimes equated with attention, sometimes with verbal report ability, and sometimes operationalized in terms of behavioral dissociations between different performance measures. Moreover, the examples all seem to share a dichotomous view of conscious and unconscious processes as being qualitatively different. It is suggested that cognitive research on consciousness can help resolve the apparent disagreement about how to define and measure unconscious processing, as is illustrated by a selection of operational definitions and empirical findings from modern cognitive psychology. These empirical findings also point to the existence of intermediate states of conscious awareness, not easily classifiable as either purely conscious or purely unconscious. Recent hypotheses from cognitive psychology, supplemented with models from social, developmental, and clinical psychology, are then presented all of which are compatible with the view of consciousness as a graded rather than an all-or-none phenomenon. Such a view of consciousness would open up for explorations of intermediate states of awareness in addition to more purely conscious or purely unconscious states and thereby increase our understanding of the seemingly “unconscious” aspects of mental life.",

    "title": "Efficient Test of General Intelligence Requires Cognitive Proximity of Agents",
    "abstract": "A general characteristic of advanced intelligence is the ability to construct empirically successful responses in complex sensory environments, “solve difficult and diverse problems”. In this work, we examine the question: is it possible to evaluate intelligence of another intelligent learner efficiently, without a full independent resampling of its sensory environment and the distribution of responses? In the framework of evaluation based on the generality of knowledge interpreted as the uniformity of the distribution of the empirical success over the sensory scope, the efficiency of assessment necessitates, as we show, a strong degree of proximity, the cognitive association between the assessor and the learner. Outside of the region where such association can be reasonably established or presumed, equivalence, ordering and/or ranking of the learner’s intelligence cannot be determined both accurately and efficiently. This result can have important implications for the program of Artificial General Intelligence that may eventually produce a cohort of secondary intelligent systems capable of determining their cognitive development with a certain degree of autonomy and independence. Progressive divergence of sensory scopes in such scenarios can result in our diminishing ability not only to control but to evaluate and understand them as well.",

    "title": "Educational Assessment of Deafblind Learners",
    "abstract": "What is needed for useful and accurate assessment of learners who are deafblind? First, agreement is needed about what the term 'deafblind' means. The single greatest obstacle to devising appropriate assessment tools in this field is lack of an accepted definition of 'deafblindness'. A.B. Best, amongst others, has argued in favour of a relatively purist position in defining deafblindness. Assessment pluralism should be reflected throughout a deafblind learner's life. When assessment is norm-referenced, that is, based on a 'sample population', assessment can become testing. Norm-referenced assessment and testing can become a tool for establishing and maintaining power and relationships in society. Functional assessment should certainly include assessment of the learner's own constellation of abilities and disabilities: cognitive abilities, sensory and perceptual abilities; memory, planning, learning and problem solving; communicative abilities. Functional assessment approaches assume it is not possible to prescribe for each and every possible situation that may arise with a learner.",

Most definitions of SA focus on the awareness part and neglect the definition of a situation. SA measurement methods may be broken down as follows: direct system performance measures, direct experimental measures, verbal protocols, and subjective measures. Mission-goal awareness refers to the need to keep current with respect to the phase of the mission and the currently active goals that are to be satisfied. The ideal SA reflects the analyst's front-end analysis to identify information and knowledge requirements; requirements that are formulated with SA in mind. The difference between achievable ideal and actual SA creates the space for evaluating individual differences in the ability to achieve SA and for developing training opportunities. The subject of measurement encompasses more than just the selection of performance measures.",

    "title": "Existential Poverty: Welfare Dependency, Learned Helplessness and Psychological Capital",
    "abstract": "Abstract Being in existential poverty means living in a state of, or near, persistent material poverty while also being socially excluded, marginalized, or disadvantaged. It is a life‐disempowering experience, one that privileges both immediacy over the future, and welfare over work. This results in learned helplessness, manifesting as a lack of will to take control of life. The existentialist explanation is that those in this mental state do not have an authentic way of life. Positive Psychology, and its offshoot, Positive Organizational Behavior, provide the cognitive change strategies that focus on building in people their sense of self‐efficacy, optimism, hope, resilience, and subjective well‐being, as well as their emotional intelligence, all of which are mental attributes that have demonstrable positive impacts on human performance. This can enable people to pursue gainful, meaningful, and sustained self‐actualizing vocation, so lifting them out of persistent material poverty. The public policy challenges are (1) to determine whether it is in the public interest to redress the negative agental consequences of welfare dependency; (2) to redesign the features of social assistance programs that exacerbate learned helplessness amongst beneficiaries; and (3) to determine how best to reduce the psychologically incapacitating effects of welfare dependency.",

    "abstract": "The main topics of this chapter are children's constructions of moral judgments bearing on welfare, justice, and rights through social interactions, actions, and reflections upon thought and action. Development also involves the construction of other domains of thought, particularly the conventional and personal. Consequently, decisions about social situations can entail recognition of different components within the moral domain, as well as other domains. Social decisions involve processes of coordination or the weighing and balancing of different considerations and goals. As a means of illustrating processes of coordination in behaviors, the acts of researchers and participants in the studies by Milgram on so-called obedience to authority are analyzed. The actions of participants are interpreted not as obedience but as entailing conflicts between concerns with pain inflicted by the instructed supposed electric shocks and concerns with fulfilling the scientific aims of the research enterprise (similar to the processes involved in the decisions of the researchers). More generally, research on children's judgments of the roles of authorities is considered, showing that across ages, they make distinctions between appropriate and inappropriate commands from persons in positions of authority. Processes of coordination are involved in the development of moral thinking and in judgments leading to actions.",

As a profession, family and consumer sciences/home economics mandates that its practitioners hold deep obligations to the public they serve. Thus, morally- bound practice cannot go unchecked. Family and consumer sciences (FCS) professionals can bolster their professional accountability if they embrace eight professional imperatives, which range from the abstract and the theoretical to the concrete. These include being philosophically grounded, ethically compelled, morally obligated, values oriented, ideologically aware, theoretically mature, intellectually savvy, and competent and skilled. When embraced, these imperatives will better ensure professional accountability by FCS practitioners.",

Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs--competence, autonomy, and relatedness--which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.",

The mentally handicapped for whom rehabilitation programs are designed often constitute an extremely heterogeneous group in terms of symptoms, ability to function, and potential for rehabilitation. What they have in common is long-term incapacitation, which requires help and care. This incapacitation is basically social (stigimatization, isolation, poverty, unemployment) and psychological (loss of self-esteem); though it is a consequence of the illness, this incapacitation has an active side in that it works to make the personality even more fragile and precipitates relapses. Wolfensberger [1] has described very well the impact of the negative social roles usually imposed on people who have suffered social devaluation. According to him, everything we perceive through our senses is judged, consciously or unconsciously, positively or negatively, by another person.

Work does not only allow a person to satisfy their need to earn their living, but it also is a socially acceptable way to solve their own personal psychological problems. Addiction to working is a socially approved and rewarding behavior pattern in many countries of the world. The author describes positive psychological functions of working activity, such as structuration of a person's life, assistance in achieving a certain level of mastery, making their life more creative, possibility to adapt to a real world, personal maturing, forming a positive self‐rating, possibility to communicate and satisfy their physical needs. Negative effects include moral and ethical regulation of a person's sublimated basic needs, a neurotic addiction to working, which is pathogenic in its nature. The article presents psychological and psychiatric signs of pathological addiction to working, which can be regarded either within non‐chemical addiction or as a neurotic obsessive‐compulsive disorder. Workaholism can be considered as a clinical phenomenon when there are signs of excessive addiction to working accompanied by changes in mental state; of compulsive yearning for permanent success and appraisal; of domineering anxiety, inclination towards perfectionism and constant doubts in psychological status; of egotism; of tapering a circle of interests to those only connected with work; of ambitiousness and inclination for competition; of explicit desire to be in the know and to influence the course of events; of inability to refuse to take up extra work; of vulnerability to criticism; of preferring work to rest or working at the time intended for rest. The author also describes types of workaholics and points out the risk factors of developing addiction to working, such as family education traditions, management style and corporate culture, social, psychological and cultural factors. It was underlined that an educational strategy plays a significant role in preventing workaholism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cognition is the ability to know and think, using intellect, logic, reasoning, memory, and all of the higher cortical functions. Intact cognition allows humans to appreciate their inner and outer worlds, and to interact with others and negotiate daily life. Thus, appropriate communication and comprehension depend not only on speech and language abilities (Chapter 4) and the absence of a thought disorder (Chapter 5), but also on other brain functions that relate to cognition and intellect. These functions should be indirectly and directly assessed during the MSE interview. In contrast to the other portions of the MSE, cognition is tested in a structured fashion. Specific assessment of a variety of cognitive functions should be completed during patient examination. In many cases, it is useful to administer one of any number of standardized screening cognitive tests so that the patient’s performance can be compared to normative data from a larger population of persons. The use of standardized tests allows a comparison to the patient’s performance at a different time or when tested by a different examiner. Test scores can be recorded in the chart and graphed over time. Standardized tests range from cognitive screening tests to be used at the bedside or in the office to formal neuropsychologic testing. Screening tests can be administered in a brief period and are usually comprised of a small number of items that assess different cognitive and language abilities. One of the most widely used screening tests is the Mini-Mental state exam (see Folstein, Folstein, and McHugh, 1975), which superficially assesses a variety of cognitive functions. Screening tests can then be supplemented with more sensitive tests of specific areas of cognition.",

    "abstract": "Integrity or moral wholeness is the foundation of moral resilience. Integrity arises when intentions, words, thoughts, and actions align and there is fidelity in adherence to ethical commitments, norms, and conscience. It includes a robust notion of moral agency that includes considerations of the congruence of intentions, character, choices, behavior, and actions as well as responsibility for them. It requires a well-honed conscience; moral sensitivity, perception, and imagination; self-regulatory capacities; ongoing reflection to evaluate one’s intentions, motivations, and actions; cognitive judgment; the ability to devise reasonable solutions to internal conflicts; and steadfast commitment to responsibly enact considered decisions. Clinicians have dual obligations to those they serve and to themselves. Personal and relational integrity are fundamental considerations for clinicians. This dynamic interplay requires attunement to the issues of personal and relational integrity that are at play in clinical practice, including relationships with patients, families, colleagues, leaders, organizations, and the broader society.",

Intuitions develop about a subject matter through years of study, investigation, and problem solving, just as chess masters develop a sophisticated set of cognitive structures that change the very appearance of the chess board. In part because the subject matter is so personal, students new to personality and social psychology arrive with many intuitions, prior beliefs, and naive theories about social processes and behavior based on unsystematic experiences and observations. These intuitions can hinder or foster theoretical progress. The role of mentors, critiques, and empirical tests in minimizing the deleterious effects of these entry biases is discussed. Refined scientific intuitions are also subject to error, however, so means of minimizing these errors are also discussed.",

Comunicarse con eficacia o de manera asertiva es una clase de conducta susceptible de entrenamiento mediante procedimientos fundamentados en la Teoría del Aprendizaje Social. Como cualquier clase de conducta, consta de distintos componentes: cognitivos, emocionales y de comportamiento manifiesto (tanto verbal como no verbal), que deben ajustarse a una situación concreta para lograr su funcionalidad. Ello aumenta, a su vez, la probabilidad de alcanzar los objetivos planteados y de responder con certeza a las demandas propuestas, obteniéndose así una serie de ventajas, tanto personales como grupales y organizativas. Entre ellas, se puede destacar el alcanzar una mayor competencia social, autoestima, satisfacción personal, cohesión grupal, destreza para trabajar en equipo y una disminución de las tensiones y conflictos interpersonales y grupales. La obra que te dispones a ver, partiendo de un supuesto práctico como es la participación en una entrevista de selección de personal, pretende responder de una manera aplicada a las siguientes cuestiones: Qué son las habilidades sociales, para qué sirven, cómo se adquieren, qué clase o estilo de comunicación es más eficaz, qué técnicas son más ventajosas para su enseñanza y cómo puede beneficiar su aprendizaje. Esta obra es fruto de una larga experiencia en el desarrollo de programas de entrenamiento en habilidades sociales con y para distintos colectivos que deben afrontar situaciones difíciles y conflictivas, que requieren para su resolución el apoyo y la comunicación interpersonal y social. En su realización, no solo hemos puesto nuestro conocimiento del tema, difundido a través de monografías y artículos científico-técnicos, sino también la emoción que nos genera trabajar en un tema en el que creemos y sabemos puede ser útil para otras personas. Deseamos que disfrute utilizando esta humilde aportación al entrenamiento en habilidades sociales, tanto como nosotros realizándola.",

It is important that social workers be able to extend their thinking so problems can be understood at the group, as well as individual level. Group-level problems occur in all areas of professional life. Social workers spend their professional careers as members of groups. Agencies, community groups, work teams, committees, case conferences, educational groups, and social networks all exemplify unavoidable groups. Concurrently, social workers intervene with groups of clients. Regardless of the type and purpose of the group, problems at the group level will occur.

Discourse analysis, two illustrative cases, social construction theory and positioning are used to highlight some of the ethical dilemmas involved in basing a determination of capacity on the diagnosis of dementia and neuropsychological tests of cognitive function. Although neuropsychological tests have their place in assessing some aspects of cognitive function, aspects cognition such as meaning-making ability and selfhood cannot be assessed in a standard format. In dementia, there can be a differential impairment of recall memory while the personality, values and substantial long-term memory remain intact, as does implicit memory for recent events. People with dementia are vulnerable to being negatively positioned, thereby unfairly undermining their rights to make decisions about aspects of their lives. Assessing the capacity of a person with dementia to engage in decision-making is presently in need of examination so as to take into account the person's meaning-making ability and selfhood. Incorrect negative positioning, based on the diagnosis and defects in recall memory, can obscure intact cognitive abilities that allow a person to make decisions about aspects of living, creating the possibility of lasting harm being inflicted on the person with dementia.",

    "title": "Reflexive Methods of Knowledge in Educational Activities: Phenomenological Hermeneutics",
    "abstract": "Introduction. Knowledge is one of the most important human needs. Today, lifelong learning and self-education individual skills are of paramount importance for each representative of the society in relation to the world trends of a post-industrial era: economic domination in the innovative sector, progressive increase of intensity of information flows and rates of distribution of high technologies, rapid development of science and industry of knowledge, quickly changing and becoming tougher requirements to professionalism, qualification and creativity of experts irrespective of the sphere of employment. It is obvious that structural formation and improvement of ways of students’ thinking is one of the most important tasks of the educational system; reflection is of particular importance. However, the results of training are still defined by the level of development of easily measured operational skills and cognitive qualities (memory, attention, logic), in which the reflection is presented only partially. Reflexive abilities as the mechanism and instrument of knowledge, which assist a personality to understand himself or herself, to comprehend own feelings, actions, acts and complex external realities, in most cases remain unaccounted in educational process and when analysing and evaluating the results. The aim of the article was to justify the need to form reflexive skills of knowledge in students through a combination of phenomenological and hermeneutical methods in daily pedagogical practice. Methodology and research methods. The work is based on the ideas of anthropological and phenomenological approaches in human education and - above all - the philosophic idea of “human-sizedness”, which implies anthropological view on a student. The methods of system-based and comparative analysis, as well as the methods of interpretation, synthesis and modelling were used in the course of the research. Results and scientific novelty. The author designates classical linear and neoclassical types of informative models with corresponding to them essentially different explanatory-illustrative and actively-searchable methods, which are used by teachers during classes. The advantages of phenomenological pedagogics are proved: its central category is presented by the phenomenon - sense of any phenomena or processes, which leads to the enrichment of personal experience. In phenomenological approach, the student is regarded as a live, constantly changing character of own personal formation and development; knowledge process is considered as the sequence of acts of understanding and its judgment in close teacher-student interaction. The accumulation of knowledge experience and students’’ acquisition of axiological orientations are promoted by the reflexive processes, structuring knowledge conducive to the elaboration of individual strategy and tactics of behaviour. The educational practices, based on the ways of complete development of reflexive informative abilities of individuals in the context of their activity, are known as the anthropopractices, which subject is “human” in the person and the result is self-determination.The characteristics of two leading methods of knowledge - phenomenological and hermeneutical are compared, their similarity and distinction are shown, and possible options of application are shown. The author concludes that integrated usage of phenomenological approach with hermeneutics elements in the educational activity is considered useful. Practical significance. The means of phenomenological hermeneutics described in the article become especially relevant in the conditions of digitalisation and computerisation of pedagogical communication: their use better compensates for the costs of technical methods of training by the means of real teacher-student collaboration through dialogue, knowledge process, experience, interpretation and reflection of the discipline under study.",

    "abstract": "Musical education and development are connected with numerous challenges, such as great expectations, repertoire requirements, or consistent practice. At the same time, a destructive role of assessment, comparisons and expectations does not influence solely the effectiveness and quality of concerts, or auditions. Musicians experience various obstacles, including doubts, self-criticism, lack of self-confidence; they also experience anxiety and depression more frequently than the rest of the population. Going through such psychological hardships has an impact on their professional life and the quality of life in general. Over the course of music education, it is worth striving for the development of working methods regarding the prophylaxis of mental health and maintenance of mental well-being, which could be introduced as part of systemic programs offering psychological help. What may potentially be used here is a model of psychological flexibility, equipped with firm empirical foundations and covering processes that are tailor-made for the needs of the musical community. Formal and informal exercises in mindfulness, value recognition, or setting goals based on values, applied as part of work within the psychological flexibility model, result directly in, for instance, mindful, dedicated preparation and performances, as well as in enhanced self-confidence indirectly. For musicians this may be of a particular importance, as it has impact on better management of workload and preparations, despite experienced pressure of achieving perfection, on a higher quality of performance, enabling to experience ultimate and mindful performance, and first of all – on a sense of meaning and fulfillment.",

    "title": "Innovative approach to emotional intelligence",
    "abstract": "An investment in knowledge is an investment in a better future. As the pace of change is increasing and world of work is making ever greater demands on a person’s cognitive, emotional and physical resource. Since majority of the concerns in organization involve people in different roles, emotional intelligence has become a determining factor for their effective management. Social and personal competencies and skills such as problem solving, communication, collaboration, interpersonal skills, social skills and time management are actively being targeted by prospective employers as essential requirements for employability especially in team environments. Emotional Quotient describes a concept that involves the ability, capacity, skill or a self-perceived ability, to identify, assess, and manage the emotions of one’s self, of others, and of groups. The Emotional Quotient concept argues that IQ is too narrow; that there are wider areas of emotional intelligence that dictate and enable how successful we are. Researchers in diverse fields have studied emotional intelligence and found the construct to be associated with a variety of intrapersonal and interpersonal factors such as mental health, relationship satisfaction, and work performance. This article reviews research investigating the impact of training in emotional-intelligence skills and indicates that it is possible to increase emotional intelligence and that such training has the potential to lead to other positive outcomes. The paper offers suggestions about how future research, from diverse disciplines, can uncover training most effectively increase emotional intelligence and produce related beneficial outcomes.",

A certain degree of discomfort over selecting the most appropriate roles, goals, and values that could give one's life a sense of direction and purpose is normative and developmentally appropriate. However, for a large minority of young people, these feelings of distress can be overwhelming and debilitating, ultimately interfering with rather than facilitating the resolution of identity dilemmas. The prevalence of this problem is discussed, and the psychological correlates of identity distress, cross‐cultural findings, and the development of intervention efforts examined.",

    "abstract": "Les troubles cognitifs constituent incontestablement une des caracteristiques les plus invalidantes de la schizophrenie et sont fortement correles aux perturbations de la vie quotidienne et de l’insertion socioprofessionnelle des patients. Differents programmes de remediation cognitive ont vu le jour ces dernieres annees. S’ils semblent etre le corollaire destroubles cognitifs, leurs benefices sur le statut fonctionnel des patients restent peu convaincants a ce jour. En cause : la non prise en compte de la double heterogeneite des troubles cognitifs et des plaintes des patients. L’alternative proposee a ces etudes consiste a travailler selon la methodologie des cas unique ou multiple en partant du pragmatisme des plaintes des patients, pour mettre en oeuvre des interventions centrees sur les activites specifiques de la vie quotidienne mettant en jeu les aspects fonctionnels alteres. L’objectif de cette these a ete d’etudier l’efficacite d’une telle demarche. Deux prises en charge individualisees et une prise en charge de groupe ont ete elaborees. Une premiere etude visait a optimiser la realisation des activites particulieres de la vie professionnelle du sujet a travers l’accroissement de l’efficacite de deux sous-composantes de la Memoire de Travail ; les deux autres etudes se sont focalisees sur les aspects executifs de la memoire episodique verbale et ont inclus une strategie organisationnelle de l’encodage visant a promouvoir les operations de comprehension et de structuration de l’information, dans le but d’optimiser la realisation d’activites de la vie quotidienne (lectures, conversations, sorties culturelles, suivi de programmes TV). Les resultats temoignent de l’efficacite et de la specificite de chacune de ces interventions.

    "title": "THE CLASSIFICATION OF BARRIERS OF MASTERING THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE ACTIVITIES BY PROFILE SCHOOL PUPILS",
    "abstract": "The article is devoted to the problem of students’ barriers in learning foreign languages. The author stresses that the uniform classification of barriers do not exist as such, because every scientist studying a particular problem, underlines the presence of specific barriers, depending on the research subject. The author proves that it is appropriate to classify barriers to internal and external. Among the internal barriers they distinguish physiological, motivational, and emotional. Cognitive, communication, control, appreciation and proper speech barriers belong to external ones. Physiological barrier deals with the barrier of temperament that arises when the temperament of the teacher and the learner are opposite and this difference is not reflected. The motivational barrier is formed as a result of the lack of positive cognitive motivation of learning, the value of the profession. Emotional barriers include: actualization of negative traces of emotional memory when encountering a learning task, general unfavorable individual emotional background of activity, attraction. Organizational barriers are the result of poor organization of the learning process. The basis of information barriers lies in the improper structuring of educational information, the pace of its presentation, ignoring the laws of psychology of perception and the individual features of the cognitive, motivational, emotional spheres of the learner and his behavioral resources. Proper speech barriers include barriers to listening, speaking, reading and writing. Listening is accompanied by states of tension, panic, boredom, frustration, fear of failure, laziness, etc. Speaking a foreign language causes states of uncertainty, anxiety, fear of making a mistake. Usually reading does not cause acute problems, but working with the text, performing a number of tasks can be accompanied by laziness and boredom. Writing is accompanied by the fear to demonstrate ignorance of the subject in front of the teacher, inability to clearly and competently express thoughts in written form. Key words: classification, barrier, obstacle, the process of learning, foreign language.",

    "title": "Individual Case Evaluation",
    "abstract": "This chapter describes the promising methodology for evaluating social work with individual cases. Individual case evaluation is a framework to quantify the effects of intervention on any single unit without separate comparison and control groups. From social work, psychology, sociology, education, psychiatry, biology, economics, history, and political science come field applications of individual-case evaluation. The fundamental bases of individual-case evaluation are therefore operationalized in every social work practice situation. The use of clinical-research procedures not differing from those of routine social work practice provides an impetus to individual-case evaluation though this correspondence neither masks nor otherwise distorts the nature of the approach. Social work with children who hurt themselves by self-mutilation or who physically calls for quick and uninterrupted intervention. Few social work situations are closed to individual-case evaluation. Social work roles of direct service, consultation, administration, and policy analysis are equally suited to individual-case evaluation.",

Accordingly, denial of disordered eating may stem from various motivations such as a defense of self, shame and stigmatization, and/or fear of intervention. Denial of disordered eating is important to study and understand because it is associated with a variety of maladaptive consequences, including interpersonal conflict, suicidality, and further disordered eating.

    "abstract": "Interdisciplinary research on the relation of well-being to personality, virtue and life experience is impeded by lack of agreement about the nature of well-being. Psychologists tend to reduce well-being to various subjective evaluations (e.g., life satisfaction or sense of meaning in life). Philosophers tend to reject these reductions but often do not agree among themselves. We believe most conceptions of well-being can agree that well-being involves success in one's personal projects and that personal projects should be a central construct for well-being assessments. Here we provide some initial evidence that traditional psychological approaches to well-being are commensurable with our personal projects approach, by demonstrating in a longitudinal sample that success in current personal projects predicts various forms of subjective well-being, even when controlling for past levels of well-being and project success.",

Objectives: To determine the influence of ethical dilemmas in the profession of the psychologist. Methodology: A documentary, cross- sectional, descriptive bibliographic investigation was carried out, through which information is collected from different databases such as: Scielo, Dialnet, Redalyc, Google Schollar, among others; to obtain results with the different types of analyzes performed in each of them, to obtain conclusions with a minimum margin of error, through a triangulation of data. Results: Professional ethics is closely related to morality, general principles and deontological rules, the place to develop a set of competencies, which are addressed, knowledge, skills and courage actions that guide the exercise, directions to elementary eminent judgments of effectiveness. Conclusion: The influence of ethical dilemmas in the profession of the psychologist represents a harmful state, therefore, negatively affects their professional practice, since the established ethical principles and moral norms are violated, thus ensuring that the rights of others are defenseless. It is for this reason, that one should keep in mind that a dilematic situation will depend so much on the behavior, discipline and integrity of the professional.",

It is formed and developed in the process of education. Cognitive activity is traditionally regarded as a special kind of mental activity. There are different components of cognitive activity and levels of its development. The higher the level of cognitive activity is, the more efficient the whole process of education is as knowledge is acquired more quickly and at a higher level. Cognitive independence combined with cognitive activity can radically improve the whole process of cognition. Thus, the task of an educational process is to activate cognition and develop cognitive independence by different methods and approaches.",

Components of evaluation discussed include developmental and medical history as well as assessments across multiple domains: diagnostic symptoms (social skills, communication skills, repetitive behaviors), cognitive skills (intellectual, language, attention, executive functioning), adaptive behavior, and psychiatric comorbidities. In conducting the evaluation, the examiner must carefully consider which developmental areas to assess and which measures to administer to best answer the referral question, provide accurate diagnosis, and inform treatment recommendations. Considerations and strategies are presented for cases in which specific needs or behaviors may necessitate changes to typical assessment choices and administration.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with dementia experience a variety of different symptoms, as all structures and functions of the brain are influenced, have increasing and multidimensional needs, tend to have low life quality, and to ‘lose themselves’ as the disorder progresses. Formal care and treatment of dementia aims at improving the life of the sufferers, yet often sets compartmentalized goals, and becomes impersonal and generic- thus less effective, despite the efforts. With these in mind, a holistic approach towards dementia arises. The goal is to enhance the self and improve life quality, while delaying the progression of the disorder. The self is seen as composed of a somatosensory, a cognitive, an emotional, a behavioral and a social aspect, along with psychological properties of the self (such as self- knowledge, or self- resilience). All these aspects are influenced by the disorder, thus are targeted through the intervention. The intervention follows the person-centered rational and uses all arts as a stimulus. It is composed of sessions with activities- each of which has a somatosensory, a cognitive, an emotional and a behavioral/social element, all of which are linked to the self and its properties. Previousresearch indicated the effectiveness of each element. The intervention was applied in ten case studies, with a qualitative and quantitative assessment (about the self, cognitive skills and life quality) occurring before and after. Results indicate that the intervention was efficient in enhancing the sense of self, delaying the progression of the disorder and improving life quality, and can be explained both through a neuroscientific and a psychotherapeutic perspective. Results imply that the self is a promising ‘target’ for a holistic approach (although more research is necessary), and can be applied both as a structured intervention, and as a rational of care and interaction, characterized by individualized approach and respect to the person’s uniqueness- their self.",

    "title": "Psychophysiological characteristics of anxiety and intellectual activity in childhood (review)",
    "abstract": "The article presents the views of domestic and foreign scientists on the relationship of anxiety and intellectual activity. The interrelations and dependences of intellectual activity on the level of anxiety have been described. Anxiety is a subjective manifestation of the unfavorable interaction of the individual with the environment. The optimal level of anxiety can have a positive impact and help to mobilize activity and achieve the best result. The high level of anxiety will prevent the normal development of adaptive processes. Intelligence as a capacity is considered as an independent reality based on the criterion of behavior regulation. The method of internal organization of an integrated system of intelligence is a cross-functional communication of mental functions of different levels (memory, thinking, attention). If we consider intelligence as certain ability, it is necessary to talk about the adaptive value of intelligence for a human. High anxiety can prevent formation of adaptive behavior and lead to a disturbance of behavioral integration, reduce the possibility of self-actualization. High anxiety in children prevents effective schooling, reducing the ability to concentrate and mental performance, worsening the information reproduction and associative thinking. Anxiety can cause school neuroses, failure to adapt to a new situation, difficulties in intellectual activity, reduce mental performance, and cause difficulties in communication and establishing interpersonal relations with other people. Anxiety is a serious risk factor for the development of psychosomatic disorders and often causes stress. The results of the studies prove the data that high anxiety has a disruptive influence on the effectiveness of human intellectual activity. In this regard, the study of the anxiety nature and its impact on the intellectual and personal development of the child is of particular importance and relevance.",

    "abstract": "The professional application of ethics often lacks the necessary conceptual tools to construct adequate theoretical foundations that can be used for practical enterprise. Health care professionals, such as psychologists and sociologists, education institution administrators and teachers (among others) , are all, broadly speaking, supposed to be able to take responsibility for other people’s personal development. This makes the relative lack of attention given to theoretical foundations for knowledge on mental development and cognitive sciences all the more puzzling. This book focuses on an anthropological approach to mental illness, describing how schizophrenia can distort one’s experience of empathy and of the presence in the world through pathological indifference. It describes factual and phenomenological perspectives on a case of schizophrenia, based on the method of Eugène Minkowski.",

    "title": "Social Work Glossary: Mental Health",
    "abstract": "Mental health concerns itself with the operation of the mind including thoughts, emotions, affect and cognitions. As these are in themselves complex entities the way in which we understand mental health remains challenging. Mental health as a term is used broadly in professional practice, academic writing and popular media. It can be contrasted with other terms that have been used to understand the health of the mind, like mental illness which is deficit focused and medically orientated and the term mental disorder which in some settings provide a medical-legal definition. Additionally there are lay interpretations of the term mental health which are reflected in everyday beliefs, influenced by the media.  Terms such as ‘psycho,’ ‘barmy’ and ‘madness’ are examples of the everyday references to mental health within the public discourse. While lay definitions are often discriminatory and stigmatising they reveal the underlying opinions and attitudes that exist when mental health is talked about. These definitions should not be discounted as they reveal how everyday attitudes around mental health are informed by language, the media and personal experience.  The variety of ways of understanding the term mental health tells us that the term mental health is far from clear and does not hold a common shared meaning. The World Health Organisation considers that mental health is less defined by its deficit – mental illness/ mental disorder but is understood more positively. In its work the World Health Organisation notes that mental health and in particular mental distress is evident in all societies and in its attempt to provide a globally acceptable definition of mental health it highlights that the definition of mental health includes a “state of well being, being able to realise one’s own potential and is able to cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and make a contribution to his or her community” (WHO 2010 p6).  This definition positively avoids medical or legal terminology but does face some challenges like the practical application of well-being which can be subject individual interpretation.",

A singular meaning of well-being is difficult to identify, as there are several interconnected factors that contribute, including physical, social, financial, career, and community factors.1 However, most would agree that well-being involves “the presence of positive emotions and moods, the absence of negative emotions, satisfaction with life, and fulfillment and positive functioning,” as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.2 Positive mental health envelops the psychological elements that comprise well-being. Conversely, poor well-being has been found to be associated with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety.3 These conditions can have a negative impact on school or work performance, aspects of relations with friends and family, and one’s ability to participate in the community. Burnout and stress are also barriers to well-being and can lead to significant personal and professional concerns.4",

    "title": "Cognitive Remediation in Schizophrenia",
    "abstract": "Abstract It is well established that many people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia experience significant problems with thinking skills such as concentration, memory, comprehension of social information, reasoning, and organization. These are often experienced by the individuals themselves as debilitating and demoralizing, but crucially, they also can limit people in their capacity to achieve fundamental life goals, such as working, having fulfilling relationships and living independently, which underpin well‐being and a satisfactory quality of life. Cognitive remediation for schizophrenia is a psychological therapy that aims to improve thinking skills and consequently to benefit other more general areas of functioning and improve quality of life. This entry will summarize the foundational research background to the development and effectiveness of cognitive remediation; and the cutting‐edge research into the developments in our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive change and its relationship to improvements in everyday functioning, and new applications for cognitive remediation. The key aims for the field of cognitive remediation are now (i) to optimize its effectiveness in improving cognitive skills, but critically, in a way that ensures that these cognitive improvements have a measurable impact on other more general life skills, and (ii) to facilitate the wider dissemination of cognitive remediation into the clinical community. To achieve these goals, we need to establish an evidence‐based, theoretical underpinning to cognitive remediation, including an understanding of the active ingredients and how best to deliver the therapy.",

    "title": "RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STUDENT PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT FULFILLMENT AND EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE",
    "abstract": "Psychological contract theory is a framework for understanding the expectations and obligations that exist between individuals and organizations. In the context of education, students have certain expectations about what they will receive from their education, such as high-quality instruction, a supportive learning environment, and opportunities for personal growth. Organizations, on the other hand, have certain expectations of their students, such as academic achievement, responsible behavior, and contributions to the campus community. When students' expectations are met, they are more likely to feel that their psychological contract has been fulfilled. This can lead to a number of positive outcomes, such as increased satisfaction with their education, improved academic performance, and stronger commitment to their institution. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. It is a complex construct that includes a number of skills, such as self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and social skills. There is a growing body of research that suggests that emotional intelligence is linked to a number of positive outcomes, such as academic success, job performance, and mental health. In the context of education, emotional intelligence can help students to cope with stress, manage difficult emotions, and build positive relationships with their teachers and peers.",

    "abstract": "The Internet has grown increasingly relevant in the practice of forensic psychiatry. To a psychiatrist conducting a forensic evaluation, the evaluee's Internet use can be relevant in nearly all aspects of the analysis. An evaluee's Internet presence may help to confirm, corroborate, refute, or elaborate on the psychiatrist's general impression of the person. Questions about the individual's choice of screen names, activities, images, and phrases can be valuable conversational tools to increase candor and self-disclosure, even among less cooperative evaluees. Difficulties in mood or affect regulation, problems with thought process or content, and impaired impulse control may be apparent in the evaluee's behavior in various Internet forums-for example, hostile or provocative behavior in social forums or excessive use of gaming or shopping websites. Discussions about the evaluee's behavior on the Internet can help the psychiatrist to assess for impaired insight and judgment. Perceptual disturbances, such as derealization and depersonalization, may be related to an evaluee's overidentification with the virtual world to the neglect of real-life needs and responsibilities. Furthermore, digital evidence can be especially useful in assessments of impairment, credibility, and dangerousness or risk, particularly when the evaluee is uncooperative or unreliable in the face-to-face psychiatric examination. This discussion will provide illustrative examples and suggestions for questions and topics the forensic psychiatrist may find helpful in conducting a thorough evaluation in this new age of the Internet.",

Qualitative Grounded Theory analysis was employed to study children assembling toys from pictorial instructions. The resulting model showed that usability problems can have a striking impact beyond just performance, affecting the user's self-efficacy, particularly among girls who tend to use internal attributions and equate difficulty with low ability. Without sufficient self-efficacy, the child will likely choose not to engage with assembly tasks and may regard him or herself as inadequately skilled in that area. Usability professionals should consider adding self-efficacy measures to provide more complete assessments.",

    "title": "Cognitive chicken or the emotional egg? How reconceptualizing decision-making by integrating cognition and emotion can improve task psychometrics and clinical utility",
    "abstract": "Decision-making is an executive function, tapping into cognitive, emotional, and personality-based components. This complexity, and the varying operational definitions of the construct, is reflected in the rich array of behavioral decision-making tasks available for use in research and clinical settings. In many cases, these tasks are \"subfield-specific,\" with tasks developed by cognitive psychologists focusing on cognitive aspects of decision-making and tasks developed by clinical psychologists focusing on interactions between emotional and cognitive aspects. Critically, performance across different tasks does not consistently correlate, obfuscating the ability to compare scores between measures and detect changes over time. Differing theories as to what cognitive and/or emotional aspects affect decision-making likely contribute to this lack of consistency across measures. The low criterion-related validity among decision-making tasks and lack of consistent measurement of the construct presents challenges for emotion and decision-making scholars. In this perspective, we provide several recommendations for the field: (a) assess decision-making as a specific cognitive ability versus a taxonomy of cognitive abilities; (b) a renewed focus on convergent validity across tasks; (c) further assessment of test-retest reliability versus practice effects on tasks; and (d) reimagine future decision-making research to consider the research versus clinical implications. We discuss one example of decision-making research applied to clinical settings, acquired brain injury recovery, to demonstrate how some of these concerns and recommendations can affect the ability to track changes in decision-making across time.",

    "abstract": "The effect of \"emotional instability\" upon the measurement of intelligence is well known; the accurary of the measurement is impaired. Emotional factors strongly effect the \"fruitfulness\" and \"direction\" of the intelligence; but we still insist upon treating intelligence as a thing apart. Evidence is offered that intelligence is part of a total organic attitude involving also attitudes of mind, emotional conditions, ingrained habits, and conditioned behavior. In children of high-school age this total attitude is the essential factor in counseling and segregation. The greater the emotional contribution to the total attitude, the more subordinate is the intelligence. This attitude is a changing complex in response to situational factors. Transient situations may produce emotional disturbances reflected in lower results in mental testing at such times. The inequalities in mental tests from a given child are an index to his emotional capacity. The total organic attitude becomes more complex through the operation of a long-continued disturbing situation, possibly also through inherent characteristics of the individual reacting in extraordinary ways to temporary situations. Inasmuch as behavior grows out of this total attitude and decisions in domestic, educational, and vocational crises are dictated by it, the total attitude itself and the situational factors which produced it are the essential factors in counseling high-school children. Classes segregated according to these factors present more uniform teaching problems than classes segregated on the basis of intelligence tests alone.",

It is natural, then, that we should ask the following question. Can we meas ure specific factors associated with reading comprehension? Logical analysis and thoughtful speculation led many interested students of the reading process to describe reading comprehension in terms of several skills and functions. There seems to be wide agreement among them that reading comprehension can best be described in terms of multiple skills and abilities, rather than as a single or unitary function. Several fundamental questions are raised when we accept the multi-ability description of reading comprehension.",

Leisure activities are positive activities, identified psychologically by particular sets of behaviors and sociologically by their place in a leisure social world and often in a social institution (e.g. sport, art, entertainment). Leisure is defined and the concept of leisure experience examined. Next, the serious leisure perspective is introduced. The main part of the article explores the emotions of leisure experience in interpersonal relationships, contemplation/spirituality, volunteering, quality of life/well-being, happiness, and play and creativity.

    "title": "Human Intelligence",
    "abstract": "Intelligence can be defined as a general mental ability for reasoning, problem solving, and learning.Because of its general nature, intelligence integrates cognitive functions such as perception, attention, memory, language, or planning.Exploring the relationships between human intelligence and the brain requires a careful consideration of the structure of human intelligence. 1Individual differences in intelligence (cognitive abilities) are a prominent aspect of human psychology, and play a substantial role in influencing important life outcomes. 2Studies suggests that larger brain predicts greater intelligence. 3In contrast to looking for a unique component of intelligence, the triarchic theory of intelligence defines it as comprising three components: the metacomponents, the performance components, and the knowledge-acquisition components.The metacomponents refer to the executive processes involved in problem solving, including mental manipulation and management.The performance components work as the carrier to implement the outcome of metacomponents, i.e., carrying out the actions.The knowledge-acquisition components are associated with the mental processes to obtain new information involving selectively dealing with relevant information and combining various pieces of information. 4An efficient way to improve cognitive performance is to (1) dissect an unstructured and chaotic problem/ goal into simpler sub-problems/sub-goals; and (2) only a sub-goal of behavior needs to be achieved in each attentional episode or each piece of cognitive segmentation.The essence of this strategy is to reduce the load of cognitive control for the coordination of thoughts and actions between attentional episodes.Even within each attentional episode, cognitive control is necessary to achieve subgoaldirected behavior.Therefore, this strategy of cognitive segmentation is consistent with our information theory account of cognitive control that is to reduce uncertainty. 5The relationship among intelligence, cognitive control, and working memory was examined using structural equation modeling.Results showed that cognitive control shared a large amount of variance with working memory and both measures were strongly associated with fluid intelligence Gf (Gf, concerning the ability to solve problems by abstraction) and crystalized intelligence (Gc, related to learning from prior knowledge and experience), with a stronger association with Gf than Gc.These findings suggest that cognitive control, serving as a core construct of executive functions, contributes substantially to general intellectual ability, especially fluid intelligence. 6",

It starts with the birth of an individual and then it goes on till the last day of the individual. A teacher is an acknowledged guide or helper in process of learning. A teacher’s role-play may vary between cultures. It is through education on that man develops his thinking and reasoning, problem solving and creativity, positive sentiments and skills, good values and attitude. It is through education that man is transformed into human, social, moral and spiritual being. Over the past several years, emotional intelligence has found increased acceptance as a factor that is potentially useful in understanding and predicting individual performance at work. Emotional abilities hold the key to a successful Career. It helps the individual much in all his/her spheres of life through its various constituents or components namely knowledge of his emotions managing the emotions in other empathy and handling relationship. Everybody has his own emotional intelligence on different aspects like achievement, motivation, aspiration, adjustment, values, creative, and attitude interest and on the whole the entire personality.

High on its priority list have been topics such as early childhood experience and learning, motivation, perception, intelligence, language and concept development, personality and socialization. From the point of view of sport, one topic is very notable by its absence from this list, motor development. That is not to say that the acquisition of motor skills has been ignored but too often physical accomplishments have been used as no more than developmental milestones, marking out what were seen as more psychologically significant developments in terms of cognitive, perceptual or social skills. Indeed it is only in the last few years that motor development has gained recognition as a valued and separate area within the subdiscipline, with a growing literature devoted solely to the topic (see Gabbard, 1992).",

    "abstract": "▪ Abstract Perceptual learning involves relatively long-lasting changes to an organism's perceptual system that improve its ability to respond to its environment. Four mechanisms of perceptual learning are discussed: attention weighting, imprinting, differentiation, and unitization. By attention weighting, perception becomes adapted to tasks and environments by increasing the attention paid to important dimensions and features. By imprinting, receptors are developed that are specialized for stimuli or parts of stimuli. By differentiation, stimuli that were once indistinguishable become psychologically separated. By unitization, tasks that originally required detection of several parts are accomplished by detecting a single constructed unit representing a complex configuration. Research from cognitive psychology, psychophysics, neuroscience, expert/novice differences, development, computer science, and cross-cultural differences is described that relates to these mechanisms. The locus, limits, and applications of perceptual learning are also discussed.",

    "title": "Contextual Dissociation Theory",
    "abstract": "Contextual Trauma Theory (CTT) proposes that dissociation is a basic mode of human functioning, not an anomalous, inherently pathological phenomenon. From this perspective dissociation comprises a spectrum of manifestations from highly adaptive to extremely problematic. Problematic dissociation related to complex trauma is understood not only as a response to traumatization, but also an expression of developmental deprivation: insufficient emotional support and cognitive stimulation by a child's caretakers resulting in restricted neuropsychological, psychological, and social maturation, manifested as functional deficits. Within this framework, a key aspect of problematic dissociation is severely limited capacities for sustained attention, and consequently for focal awareness of, and experiential connection to, one or more of three major spheres: the personal; the interpersonal; and the environmental. In contrast, adaptive dissociation reflects instances of detachment from awareness that promote effective functioning (e.g., screening out potential distractions to sustain concentration on a demanding task). Individuals exhibiting complex dissociation lack the capacity to sustain an attentive, focused, coherent state of consciousness that would allow them to maintain adaptive dissociation while electing not to have their awareness absorbed by dissociative symptoms. In contrast, with sufficient developmental attainment comes the ability to direct and modulate awareness, experientially connecting or disengaging as needed.",

The underlying problems of the psychopathic defective are essentially identical with those of the superior psychopaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nThe mental integrations described as intellectual simply give color and direction to the abundant energies with which all three patients have been endowed.

    "abstract": "Obtaining informed consent is a standard procedure in research practice. However, it is not sufficient, even if an individual chooses to participate voluntarily in research process, for the researchers to be able to claim that they have obtained informed consent. The consent must be of sufficiently ‘high quality’: it must not only be informed, but also valid, i.e., it must contain the following three elements: adequate information, voluntariness, and competence. Although preparing informed consent is a difficult process in general, it is particularly challenging when working with certain populations, such as clinical groups who have language and literacy difficulties, e.g., dyslexia. A lack of understanding of the basis and specific characteristics of this disorder can have negative effects on people with dyslexia (PwD) such as in the form of unwanted misunderstandings, psychological stress, negative effects on their learning processes, as well as unethical treatment in the research process. Studies have shown that PwD can be particularly vulnerable to research that might exploit, imply, or attribute unsafe practices to them and their difficulties, especially in connection with research recommendations that require written informed consent. Easy language refers to the language adaptation of a text to facilitate both reading and comprehension, particularly for PwD. Therefore, the use of the easy language guidelines for language adaptation and graphical adjustment is important when obtaining informed consent from PwD.",

    "title": "Educating Professionals about Executive Functioning: Developing Strategies to Enhance Executive Functioning in our Communities",
    "abstract": "Executive Functioning (EF) refers to mental processes and skills required to organize the brain to act on information to reach a goal. Stated in another way, EF can be viewed as the managing system of the brain that coordinates all the activities our brainpower must accomplish. EF allows us to retain and work with a lot of information in our mind. It also helps us to filter distractions and switch from one topic or project to another. Specific skills of EF include: working memory, initiating and planning tasks and regulating behavior (impulse control, emotional control). Weak EF can occur in children with developmental disabilities (DD) and those without DD. EF dysfunction is viewed on a spectrum. Some children may have mild deficits; others may have more severe issues. Children may also have weakness in some skills and be proficient in others. EF dysfunction is not a diagnosis. It will, however, increase the difficulties of managing day-to-day activities and educational success for children/adolescents with this disorder. There is a dearth of literature on the incidence and prevalence of EF dysfunction. Even without specific statistics, special education and mental health experts are beginning to recognize the negative effect that weak EF has on a person’s academic and social abilities. Communities must become educated with issues associated with weak EF, in order to advocate for students’ needs. Learning strategies to improve students’ EF will enable children/adolescents/ students to reach their full potential as adults. This article will provide educational information and practical approaches for educators and healthcare professionals to assist families in managing EF in their children. Many of the strategies can be used in the schools and in the home to augment EF support. Adults needing EF enhancement may also find these same methods helpful.",

However, human experts are still susceptible to errors in judgment or execution, and failure to recognize the limits of knowledge. This would happen especially in semi-structured situations, in multi-disciplinary settings, under time or other stress, under uncertainty, or when knowledge is outdated Human errors are caused by cognitive biases, attentional slips/memory lapses, cultural motivations, and missing knowledge. The purpose of this research is to study errors of human experts committed in judgment and the general idea of critiquing systems as corresponding plan. Compared to expert systems, critiquing systems are narrowly focused programs useful in limited situations for collaborating with and supporting experts in their task activities. It supports an expert by detecting the human's errors by deploying various strategies that stimulate humans to improve their performance. A variety of types of critiquing systems has spread through numerous application areas.",

The present paper introduces the concept of mandevillian intelligence and reviews a number of strands of empirical research that help to shed light on the phenomenon. The paper also attempts to highlight the value of the concept of mandevillian intelligence from a philosophical, scientific and engineering perspective. Inasmuch as we accept the notion of mandevillian intelligence, then it seems that the cognitive and epistemic value of a specific social or technological intervention will vary according to whether our attention is focused at the individual or collective level of analysis. This has a number of important implications for how we think about the design and evaluation of collective cognitive systems. For example, the notion of mandevillian intelligence forces us to take seriously the idea that the exploitation (or even the accentuation) of individual cognitive shortcomings could, in some situations, provide a productive route to collective forms of cognitive and epistemic success.",

Classical theories of problem solving have emphasized the role of discovery or illumination as a primary motive to learn, but contemporary research has uncovered an array of highly predictive task- and performance-related motivational beliefs, such as self-efficacy, outcome expectations, intrinsic task interest, and learning goal orientations. Unlike trait motivational constructs, such as the need for achievement, these motivational beliefs change during the course of problem solving, and a complete account of their role must describe their interrelation with metacognitive and motor learning processes. Self-regulation models of learning and performance have integrated metacognitive, motoric, and motivational aspects of problem solving within a cyclical structure. We discuss how these task- and performance-related motivational beliefs instigate problem-solving efforts, and reciprocally how these beliefs are modified based on the outcomes of self-regulated solution efforts.",

Em relacao ao primeiro aspecto, muitos academicos recorrem ao suicidio como meio de escapar das suas angustias internas. Esses transtornos psiquicos podem ser exemplificados pela sindrome de Burnout, depressao, ansiedade, estresse relacionado ao meio academico. Entre os fatores externos e ambientais e importante salientar pressao social, apoio familiar, estigmatizacao, sobrecarga de responsabilidades, pressao excessiva do curso, mudanca de cidade e habitos e exaustao por atividades curriculares. A partir disso, percebe-se como consequencia o isolamento social dos academicos de medicina, podendo acarretar no desligamento do curso e a ideacao suicida que pode culminar na consumacao do ato extremo. A prevencao pode ser concretizada por meio de campanhas de conscientizacao e apoio psicologico nas universidades, com o intuito da promocao do bem-estar biopsicossocial do estudante. E importante salientar que esses projetos sejam implementados desde o primeiro periodo do curso, pois os academicos ja trazem consigo uma carga emocional negativamente afetada pelos processos seletivos para o ingresso na universidade. Foram selecionados 11 artigos para analises, a partir das quais demonstrou-se as categorias de discussao prevalentes: 90,90% das producoes literarias selecionadas abrangiam aspectos sociais e ambientais (pressao social, apoio familiar, estigmatizacao, sobrecarga de responsabilidades e tarefas, e pressao do curso); 63,63% aspectos e transtornos psicologicos que influenciam o risco de suicidio (estresse, depressao, ansiedade, medo e sindrome de Burnout) e somente 27,27% acerca de intervencoes e prevencao. Com relacao a categorizacao dos dados, constatou-se a ausencia de estudos de intervencao que retratem evidencias obtidas em observacoes individuais com delineamento experimental e evidencias de pesquisas quase-experimentais. Portanto, recomenda-se pesquisas acerca da problematica debatida, com a finalidade de levantar novos dados sobre esse cenario, levando em consideracao os altos indices de suicidios entre os estudantes de medicina e os fatores a eles relacionados.

It also affects the way of thinking, feeling, and situation handling of a person. A stable mental health helps in working with full potential in all stages of life from childhood to adulthood therefore it is of significant importance to find out the onset of the mental disease in order to maintain balance in life. The mental health problems are rising globally and constituting a burden on health-care systems. Early diagnosis can help the professionals in the treatment that may lead to complications if they remain untreated. The machine learning models are highly prevalent for medical data analysis, disease diagnosis, and psychiatric nosology. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> This research addresses the challenge of detecting six major psychological disorders, namely, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, Conversion Disorder, Depression, Mental Retardation, and Schizophrenia. These challenges are mined by applying decision level fusion of supervised machine learning algorithms. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> observations that we used for training and testing the models. Furthermore, to reduce the impact of a conflicting decision, a voting scheme Shrewd Probing Prediction Model (SPPM) is introduced to get output from ensemble model of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine (RF+GBM). </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> The proposed model generated the Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)-based average accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of 67% thus outperforming other machine learning models namely, Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> This research provides an intuitive solution for mental disorder analysis among different target class labels or groups. A framework is proposed for determining the mental health problem of patients using observations of medical experts. The framework consists of an ensemble model based on RF and GBM with a novel SPPM technique, namely SPPM (RF+GBM). This proposed decision level fusion approach significantly improves the performance in terms of Accuracy, Recall, and F1-score with 67%, 66%, and 67% respectively. This framework seems suitable in the case of huge and more diverse multi-class datasets. Furthermore, three vector spaces based on TF-IDF (unigram, bi-gram, and tri-gram) are also tested on the machine learning models and the proposed model. Experiments revealed that unigram performed better on the experimental dataset. In the future, more physiological parameters such as respiratory rate, ECG, and EEG signals can be included as features to improve accuracy. Also, the proposed framework can be tested on a wide range of mental illness categories by adding more mental illness diseases in the dataset which will result in an increase of class labels. </sec>",

The artifacts can be adjusted to the users' needs, introducing different configurations regarding their look, interaction and behavior, providing support to various purposes by coping with and enhancing different procedures.

    "title": "Psycho-Cognitive Human Deprivation: The Essence and Main Aspects",
    "abstract": "The relevance of the research is due to the need to initialize the cognitive activity of the psyche, eliminate internal obstacles and full use of its resources as well as ensure the assimilation of knowledge and skills. The article aims to reveal the essence and main aspects of psycho-cognitive human deprivation. Psycho-energetic and energetic-psycho-functional approaches were used. Within the framework of these approaches, the cognitive sphere through Psy-programs ensures the selection of information, and it is processing, the formation of the new mental, its transmission and use. Also, methods of analysis, synthesis, comparison and grouping were used. The essence of psycho-cognitive human deprivation was revealed, which is the stagnation or destructive process of the cognitive sphere of the psyche caused by either under-development, social immaturity or destruction of certain parameters of cognitive processes or lack, absence or unreliability of knowledge; psycho-sensitive, abstract-mental and mnemonic derivations as subspecies of psycho-cognitive deprivation; some features of the operational and functional activity of the cognitive sphere of the psyche of a deprived person are found out. Revealing the essence of psycho-cognitive deprivation and the definition of its main aspects will allow to develop the measures aimed, first, at its elimination and prevention; second, the development of the cognitive sphere and the full use of its resources; third, development of psy-programs using the resources of the unconscious, subconscious, conscious and superconscious in order to search for the latest knowledge, discoveries and inventions.",

    "title": "The power of focus: unlocking creative insight and overcoming performance barriers",
    "abstract": "Challenges, problems, and conflicts can be the seeds of growth, or the seeds of destruction. It seems worthwhile to develop skills for addressing and resolving life challenges in ways that promote growth. Problem solving skills are a component of any performance challenge whether athletic, academic, professional, or personal. However, the cognitive and physiological resources and processes associated with problem solving have the potential to act in ways that both enhance and inhibit effective problem solving and performance outcomes. The threat appraisal mechanism, the subconscious process of evaluating whether a challenge poses a threat, is designed to preserve the individual but can also work to interfere with an individual’s capacity for creative problem solving. Focus, a process capable of galvanizing an individual’s attention and energies toward a singular purpose, can erode performance just as powerfully by drawing energies away from performance goals. Insight into the interactions and interdependencies of underlying cognitive and physiological mechanisms and principles comprising the problem solving process would better inform the design of facilitative performance interventions for a variety of realms including business, academic, athletic, and interpersonal. The following experimental and quasi-experimental field study explored the relationship between cognitive appraisal, attentional focus, problem solving, and goal",

    "title": "Psychological Ways of the Development of Different Types of Thinking of Students as Their Soft Skills",
    "abstract": "The purpose of our article is to analyze psychological ways of the develop­ment of different types of thinking of students as their soft skills. Methods of the research. The following theoretical methods of the research were used to solve the tasks formulated in the article: a categorical method, structural and functional methods, the methods of the analysis, systematization, modeling, generalization. The experimental method was the method of organizing empirical research. The results of the research. We proved, that a distinction had to be made between theoretical and practical thinking. Practical thinking has the aim to solve certain problems or transforming practical situations, and often exists in conditions of time shortage. Theoretical thinking acts as a process of cognition. Another dichotomous classification of thinking divides it into analytical, namely, that which unfolds in time, consists of different stages in the consciousness of the person who thinks, who is intuitive, who proceeds quickly, does not have clear stages and who is realized in a little degree. A distinction is also made by us between creative and reproductive thinking. We believe that mental culture implies a productive nature of thinking, which cannot exist outside the assimila­tion of reproductive procedures by a person, therefore, both types of thinking are important for the formation of a mental culture. All these characteristics of different types of thinking are so called soft skills, which are the basis of the development of students as future professionals. Conclusions. To learn a new subject and solve a problem facing a person, the subject’s creative thinking progresses through the implementation of many operations that are components of the thinking process. The following groups of thinking components are conventionally distinguished: thinking operations –&gt; analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization, abstraction, concretization, clas­sification, systematization; thinking forms –&gt; concepts, judgments, inferences; thinking qualities –&gt; proveness, criticality, objectivity, laconicism, etc. We note that thinking cannot be reduced only to a system of intellectual operations. Occupying a central place in the structure of general intelligence, thinking and soft skills determine intelligence both procedurally and personally.",

    "title": "Comparative analysis of the level of adaptive behaviour according to place of residence of adults with moderate intellectual disabilities",
    "abstract": "Adaptive behaviour (AB) is a way of meeting personal requirements of natural and social surroundings. Rate of AB shows the level of which an individual is able to use the cognitive potential for adapting to the demands of everyday life. Persons with intellectual disabilities (ID) in the process of education are generally able to live a fairly independent life and work. However, they are never completely independent as they require different levels of management and support all of their lives. They follow the same legality in development as any other person; however, their development is slower and it shows deviations in the management of individual skills, habits, and developing abilities. Therefore, they manage to adapt their behaviour only to a certain degree. In an effort to make more objective assessment of the adapted behaviour, the intellectual ability of the individual was initially measured in the past which has not shown to be a sufficient criterion for the identification and classification of persons with ID. This has led to the development of measurement instruments for the determination of AB and consequently to the creation of numerous adapted behaviour scales. \r\nI assume in the thesis that the wards from the institution who receive a constant stimulus by the qualified staff show higher level of AB skills as wards in the domestic environment. My goal has been a comparative analysis of AB level according to the place of residence of adults with moderate ID. According to the place of residence, I divided the wards working at VDC between those living at home and those living within the institution. For the purpose of the research, I shaped an observation scale, based on existing AAMD and ABAS-II scales. It is divided into 7 areas which consist of total 117 claims with a 5-step scale from 0 to 4. It has been fulfilled by professional staff employed at VDC Toncka Hocevar. 27 adults with moderate ID, aged between 27 and 40 years, have been included in the comparison of those 14 wards from their domestic environment and 13 wards from the institution. By comparing both samples by areas I have found out that there is no statistically significant difference between the samples of wards from the domestic environment and the wards from the institution. The biggest differences are in the area of functional academic skills and there are none in the area of communication and work; elsewhere deviations are insignificant. With a properly designed scale and a comprehensive research the most critical areas and major differences of existing VDC could be assessed.",

    "title": "21st CENTURY SKILLS: special reference to the need of Life Skills",
    "abstract": "The way of life and work is transforming rapidly in the 21st century due to various reasons, specifically due to the technological advancement. As a result the skills to be acquired by a person are also transforming. Skill is nothing but the expertise to perform a task. NEP 2020 stresses on certain skills which can be grouped in to three main categories namely learning skills, literacy skills and life skills. NEP recognizes the importance of these skills and lays out a comprehensive framework for their development. In today’s complex life we come across different situations which essentially need certain life skills along with learning skills and literacy skills. The concept of life skill is referred as psychosocial competency, as it is psychological in nature and comprise of thinking and behavioral processes. The major classification of life skills includes thinking skills, personal skills or emotional skills and social skills. Thinking skills include self awareness, critical thinking, decision making, creative thinking etc. Personal skills include emotional intelligence, resilience, coping with stress etc. Social skills include interpersonal relationship, effective communication, empathy etc. As our education system becomes more technology based and mechanical, it is the need of the time to create proper environment for the development of different life skills in our new generation. This paper tries to discuss life skills and its importance in connection with NEP 2020, need of life skill development and measures to be adopted for the development of life skills in students through the process of education.",

    "title": "Plasticity in healthy old age : a multi-domain training approach",
    "abstract": "Aging has an impact on people’s social, cognitive, and physical functioning. Despite great individual variability, healthy aging occurs along with declines in the maximal performance of several cognitive abilities including spatial navigation and memory, visuomotor skills, and executive functions, while other abilities are spared or even improve. An increasing number of older adults fears age-related losses that affect quality of life and independent functioning. Therefore, maintaining cognitive abilities is of interest from both an individual’s perspective and from a societal one since the demographic change leads to the need of keeping older adults in the workplace.\r\nPlasticity refers to the malleability of cognitive and neural functioning. This malleability is preserved across the adult lifespan until very old age and is known to be exploited by training. Considerable scientific effort has been put into finding effective interventions to improve and stabilize cognitive and brain functioning during aging. However, evidence for domain-general and long-lasting improvements has been sparse, and the mechanisms of cognitive training are not well understood. The present thesis focuses on multi-domain training, a training approach that combines exercising cognitive, physical, and social abilities. Thus, it has the potential to increase each trained domain as well as the ability to orchestrate multiple domains.\r\nFirst, available multi-domain training studies are reviewed. This literature review concludes that previous multi-domain training approaches have not been significantly informative regarding the impact of a particular type of multi-domain training on transfer. To fill this gap, a novel training tool has been developed.\r\nThis novel training tool, called “Hotel Plastisse”, is introduced secondly. “Hotel Plastisse” is an iPad-based training specifically designed to compare the simultaneous training of three cognitive functions (multi-domain training) to the training of each single cognitive function (single-domain training). The trained domains are clearly defined and separable from each other. Thereby, training-related improvements can be related to transfer in a theoretically informed way. Furthermore, the training environment is designed as a motivating learning environment in a virtual hotel, incorporating an adaptive difficulty algorithm and providing detailed feedback. These are design aspects that are increasingly recognized as critical in the training literature.\r\nThird, a cognitive training study examines near and far transfer of single-domain and multi-domain training. Eighty-four healthy older participants aged 64 to 75 years trained either inhibition, visuomotor function, or spatial navigation (single-domain training groups), or the simultaneous combination of these three functions (multi-domain training group). With respect to near transfer, the single-domain and the multi-domain training groups did not differ. With respect to far transfer, improvements on attentional control were more pronounced in the multi- domain training group than in the single-domain training group. Furthermore, independent of training group, individuals with lower baseline performance showed higher training-related change on the transfer test battery compared to individuals with higher baseline performance. Six months after training, training-related improvements remained stable. The findings show that multi-domain training enhances functions that involve handling several different tasks at the same time, which is an everyday challenge especially for older people.\r\nFourth, functional brain network characteristics are compared between three groups of participants that differed with respect to their training history (multi-domain training group, visuomotor function training group, participants with no training history). One year after training, participants underwent high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) measurement to examine expertise-related functional connectivity and small-world network characteristics during performance on the multi-domain training task. The multi-domain training group performed significantly better than the visuomotor function training group and the control group (no training history). In addition, the multi-domain training group showed enhanced and\r\nmore efficient functional connectivity in a task-related network encompassing visual, motor, executive, and memory-associated brain areas. Hence, the findings show expertise-dependent differences in performance and neural network characteristics even a year after training.\r\nTaken together, the thesis presents evidence for cognitive and neural plasticity in healthy older adults induced by a simultaneous multi-domain training. Training regimes that target older adults’ ability to handle several tasks simultaneously may enhance the probability for an overlap with different situations. Future studies should take methodological approaches that allow researchers to relate inter-individual differences to training progress and transfer. In addition, neuroimaging will lead to a better understanding of the neurobiological bases of plasticity. Well-informed experimental paradigms combined with sophisticated behavioral and neuroimaging data analyses will provide further insights into the mechanisms of training- induced plastic changes in healthy aging, and will thereby advance the development of effective interventions.",

    "abstract": "Problem statement: Learning is a complex phenomenon which involves all the psychic functions and processes, in different moments in time their involvement varying according to age and psycho social environment. Research questions: The work discusses the level of instruction of the educators, parents, mentors, the dynamic of the formal and informal affiliation groups as variables of the learning effectiveness. Purpose of the study: The mnezico-prosexic functions are studied in direct report to practical exercises, highlighting the voluntary / involuntary ratio, the progressive memorization techniques, the attention as a factor of the motivational process and factor of scholastic success. Research methods: The measuring of the development index could be done in various ways: 1. The psycho-motor determination. 2. The social clinical determination, by delimiting the development structure: stages of intellectual development (Piaget); psycho-motor development (Gesell); affective development (Freud); moral development (Colbert). 3. The formative determination, which captures the learning capacity, without expecting that a certain manifestation to take place, but trying to capture and evaluate the individual potentiality (the proximal development area). Findings: The development factors are: genetic (phenotypic maturation), stimuli adequacy, on time apparition, the filtering function in sensitive people, the elasticity of the personality system. The influence of the environment is a condition for forming and learning. Starting from the procedure of acquiring information, we can make an analytical description of the construction of intellect sides - the capacities to: dissociate, abstract, generalize, understand, transfer, argument, classify. Conclusions: The traits described before match a certain dimension of the personality which is intelligence.",

    "title": "Cognitive Development in Adulthood",
    "abstract": "Abstract The term, “cognitive aging,” is typically used to refer to the area of developmental psychology focusing on the study of cognitive changes from young adulthood to very late life. Among the developmental processes of interest are those that reflect cognitive functioning, such as intelligence, memory, and reasoning. An underlying assumption is that cognition is used in different ways to accomplish different goals throughout adulthood, but that it is always a central component of one's concept of self—past, present, and future—and one's adjustment to challenges of everyday life. This area of lifespan developmental research is a particularly active one, in that it is at the crossroads of both classic theoretical questions and important issues of individual and social application. In this chapter, we summarize selected leading issues in the field of cognitive aging. These include: (1) intelligence and patterns of intellectual aging, (2) differential profiles associated with the “aging” of various systems of memory, (3) new topics in such memory‐related domains as metamemory and social‐interactive memory, and (4) emerging research in such novel domains as wisdom, creativity, compensation, and plasticity. We conclude that, because cognitive aging involves developmental processes that range from the neurological through the individual to the social levels of analyses, it will continue for the foreseeable future to fascinate scholars and anyone else who is curious about how and why cognitive changes occur throughout adulthood.",

    "title": "How selves differ within and across cognitive domains: self-prioritisation, self-concept, and psychiatric traits",
    "abstract": "How we build and maintain representations of ourselves involves both explicit features which are consciously accessible on reflection and implicit processes which are not, such as attentional biases. Understanding relations between different ways of measuring self-cognition both within and across such cognitive domains is important for understanding how selves may differ from one another, and whether self-cognition is best understood as largely uni-dimensional or more multi-dimensional. Further, uncovering this structure should inform research around how self-cognition relates to psychiatric and psychological conditions. This study explores the relations between different constructs of self-cognition and how variability within them relates to psychiatric traits. Our final dataset includes within-subject (n = 288, general population) measures of explicit self-concept (using both the Self Concept Clarity Scale and Self Concept and Identity Measure), implicit self-prioritisation in a shape-label matching task (for both reaction time and sensitivity) and measurement of traits for five psychiatric conditions (autism, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, depression and anxiety). We first test whether self-cognitive measures within and across domains are correlated within individuals. We then test whether these dimensions of self-cognition support a binary distinction between psychiatric conditions that either are or are not characterised in terms of self, or whether they support self-cognition as transdiagnostically predictive of the traits associated with psychiatric conditions. To do this we run a series of planned correlations, regressions, and direct correlation comparison statistics. Results show that implicit self-prioritisation measures were not correlated with the explicit self-concept measures nor the psychiatric trait measures. In contrast, all the psychiatric traits scores were predicted, to varying degrees, by poorer explicit self-concept quality. Specifically, borderline personality disorder traits were significantly more strongly associated with composite explicit self-concept measures than any of depression, anxiety, or autism traits scores were. Our results suggest that selves can differ considerably, along different cognitive dimensions. Further, our results show that self-cognition may be a promising feature to include in future dimensional characterisations of psychiatric conditions, but care should be taken to choose relevant self-cognitive domains.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to explore some of the ethical issues surrounding the assessment and determination of capacity of people with dementia in light of their meaning-making ability as shown through discourse. Discourse analysis, two illustrative cases, social construction theory and positioning are used to highlight some of the ethical dilemmas involved in basing a determination of capacity on the diagnosis of dementia and neuropsychological tests of cognitive function. Although neuropsychological tests have their place in assessing some aspects of cognitive function, aspects cognition such as meaning-making ability and selfhood cannot be assessed in a standard format. In dementia, there can be a differential impairment of recall memory while the personality, values and substantial long-term memory remain intact, as does implicit memory for recent events. People with dementia are vulnerable to being negatively positioned, thereby unfairly undermining their rights to make decisions about aspects of their lives. Assessing the capacity of a person with dementia to engage in decision-making is presently in need of examination so as to take into account the person's meaning-making ability and selfhood. Incorrect negative positioning, based on the diagnosis and defects in recall memory, can obscure intact cognitive abilities that allow a person to make decisions about aspects of living, creating the possibility of lasting harm being inflicted on the person with dementia.",

    "abstract": "Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendapatkan gambaran mengenai self efficacy pada remaja penyandang disabilitas daksa. Masa transisi dari remaja menuju dewasa merupakan proses yang sangat penting dalam perjalanan hidup seorang individu. Beberapa aspek yang dihadapi remaja pada masa ini antara lain mengembangkan keterampilan serta kompetensi yang diperlukan untuk mencapai kemandirian. Remaja dengan disabilitas daksa pun memiliki kebutuhan yang sama dengan rekan-rekan mereka yang tidak mengalami disabilitas. Namun kondisi keterbatasan fisik dapat menimbulkan permasalahan lain pada individu yang mengalaminya. Hambatan pribadi seperti harapan yang rendah akan kemampuan diri dapat menjadi permasalahan bagi mereka dalam melewati masa transisi tersebut. Salah satu upaya yang dilakukan oleh pemerintah untuk membekali remaja penyandang disabilitas daksa dengan kompetensi yang dibutuhkan dalam dunia kerja adalah melalui pemberian pelatihan keterampilan/vokasional. Menurut teori Kognitif Sosial, bagaimana orang berperilaku terkadang lebih baik diprediksi dari keyakinan mereka atas kemampuannya daripada kemampuan mereka yang sebenarnya, yang selanjutnya disebut sebagai self efficacy. Istilah self efficacy mengacu pada keyakinan individu akan kemampuannya untuk dapat menghadapi situasi atau menyelesaikan tugas secara efektif. Tingkat self efficacy remaja penyandang disabilitas daksa dalam mengikuti kegiatan pelatihan akan mempengaruhi seberapa besar usaha yang ia keluarkan dalam mengikuti program pelatihan, apakah ia mampu mempertahankan sikap positif terhadap tujuan pelatihan, serta ketekunannya meskipun menghadapi kesulitan. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode deskriptif kuantitatif untuk mendapatkan gambaran mengenai self efficacy pada remaja penyandang disabilitas daksa yang mengikuti pelatihan keterampilan di salah satu lembaga dengan sampel sebanyak 65 orang. Pengambilan data dilakukan dengan menggunakan kuesioner yang disusun berdasarkan teori self efficacy dari Bandura (1977), yang meliputi tiga aspek self efficacy : level, strength, dan generality. Data dianalisis dengan menggunakan statistik deskriptif (distribusi frekuensi). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa sebanyak 55,4% responden memiliki self efficacy yang tinggi. Sementara sebagian lainnya masih menunjukkan keraguan atas kemampuan yang mereka miliki. Rendahnya tingkat keyakinan akan kemampuan diri dapat menghambat pengembangan keterampilan yang dibutuhkan dan mempengaruhi kegigihan seseorang ketika menghadapi tugas yang sulit. Berdasarkan kondisi tersebut, selanjutnya peneliti merancang suatu program intervensi untuk membantu mereka meningkatkan self efficacy-nya.",

    "abstract": "Entrepreneurship can be a solution to the dilemma: “Labour is a form of education, a way of ensuring existence, gaining autonomy, a physical and mental training, a way of oppression, a form of occupational therapy, all together or …none of the variants listed?” Depending on the reference field and the perspectives offered by different specializations, work is defined as a physical or intellectual action, which develop material and emotional satisfactions. Especially in closed environments, it is practiced as a form of occupational therapy (ergotherapy), because it ensures a sense of usefulness, helping to maintain somato-psycho-emotional health. The schoolmasters highlight the formative values of work for students: evaluate the native skills and abilities, lead to the discovery of new unknown interests and talents, support the student in his perfection by inoculating the ideas of responsibility, order, discipline, etc. Before 1989, in detention environment labour was mandatory, but now, labour is an optional right. The two perspectives are diametrically opposed, and the issue was addressed only from the perspective of reduced job supply, both during detention and after release. There are few publications with strict reference to this topic. In general, the social reintegration of post-execution prisoners is addressed. At this moment, the main problem highlighted is integration/reintegration on the labour market, as the main facilitating step of maintaining the accumulations during the detention period and a primary factor for avoiding the recurrence. However, those who have served a custodial sentence do not have a \"ticket\" to the labour market. To be known and solved, the situation should be addressed continuously: prevention before detention, education/re-education/training / retraining during detention and placement on the labor market / retraining immediately after release.",

    "title": "The Evaluation of the Major Characteristics and Aspects of the Procrastination in the Framework of Psychological Counseling and Guidance.",
    "abstract": "Abstract It is important to understand causes and consequences of procrastination that is appeared common among general and academic population. Procrastination affects people in various domains of life such as academic, professional, social relationships, and finance management. A person with high procrastination may lose his/her work, drop out from school, or may endanger his/her marital life. Similarly, High procrastinators might increasingly experience psychological distress related to lack of sense of personal control, self-worth and lack of sense of self-perceived personal ability as deadlines approach. The purpose of this study presents theoretical and conceptual frames of procrastination that is an important variable of individual difference and common in general and academic population. Key Words Procrastination, Conceptual Framework, Psychological Counseling. Procrastination is a phenomenon in which a person neglects to attend to a necessary responsibility, such as a task or decision, in a timely fashion, often despite their good intentions or inevitable negative and unpleasant consequences. It is not unusual for people to procrastinate occasionally, but for some, procrastination is a chronic problem that causes considerable psychological discomfort and distress. Procrastination is especially common in the general and academic populations. Ellis and Knaus (1977) point out that 95% of American college students procrastinate. In Solomon and Rothblum's (1984) survey, 46% of students reported that they procrastinate on academic tasks at least half of the time. Harriott and Ferrari (1996) refer to procrastination as one of the least understood minor human miseries, affecting 15-25% of the population during their lifetime. Procrastination is pervasive, affecting many facets of life. Milgram, Batori, and Mowrer (1993) identify five categories of procrastination; (i) life routine procrastination, (ii) decisional procrastination, (iii) neurotic procrastination, (iv) compulsive procrastination, and (v) academic procrastination. Each theory related procrastination tends to address one side of procrastination problem and not the others. For example, behavioral perspective used to in the reinforcement theory has been the prevailing explanation of procrastination under the behavioral paradigm. According to the tenets of behaviorism, procrastination can be explained in terms of incentives students have for off work and the absence of incentives for effort that contributes to goal attainment (Briody, 1980). Within the psychology literature, earliest theories of procrastination came from the psychodynamic tradition, a school of psychology that emphasizes childhood experiences as an influential factor in adult personality, unconscious mental process as influences on everyday behavior, and internal conflict as an underlying root of most behavior (Matlin, 1995). As such, psychodynamic literature primarily characterizes procrastination as a problematic behavioral manifestation of underlying internal psychic drama, often involving feelings about and towards one's family. Based on their extensive clinical experience working with procrastinators, Ellis and Knaus (1977) emphasized that the irrational nature of procrastination and the ability of the procrastinators to actively identify, dispute and restructure their irrational beliefs, self defeating cognitions to bring about desired behavioral and emotional chances. Although they have defined procrastination in technical sense as putting off something until a future time-postponing or deferring action on something you have decided to do( p.7). Ellis and Knaus (1977) characterized procrastination as resulting from three basic and, often overlapping causes: self- downing (negative and disparaging self talk), low frustration tolerance, and hostility. These three causes are viewed as manifestations of a cognitive style that involves unrealistic views about the self, others and the world. …",

The five motivational orientations are developed on the basis of the young people's narratives about their motivation regarding school and learning and existing research literature and knowledge about what is central for young people's motivation. The five motivational orientations are: Knowledge motivation, mastery motivation, involvement motivation, performance motivation and, finally, relational motivation. Knowledge motivation is, thus, about reaching beyond them and being curious about the outside world; expanding their horizons and then trying to link knowledge to their own world. Even though some pupils have a strong orientation towards school and knowledge, there are also numerous examples of pupils who find it difficult to connect to different subjects or see the point of the knowledge they are supposed to acquire. One challenge is that the learning perspective in some of the more open and playful learning processes disappears for the students.",

    "title": "Social Skills Training with Children and Young People: Theory, Evidence and Practice",
    "abstract": "Deficits in social skills and social competence play a significant role in the development and maintenance of many emotional and behavioural disorders of childhood and adolescence. Social skills training (SST) aims to increase the ability to perform key social behaviours that are important in achieving success in social situations. Behavioural SST methods include instructions, modelling, behaviour rehearsal, feedback and reinforcement, frequently used in association with interpersonal problem solving and social perception skills training. Effective change in social behaviour also requires interventions that reduce inhibiting and competing behaviours, such as cognitive restructuring, self‐ and emotional‐regulation methods and contingency management. Research suggests that SST alone is unlikely to produce significant and lasting change in psychopathology or global indicators of social competence. Rather, SST has become a widely accepted component of multi‐method approaches to the treatment of many emotional, behavioural and developmental disorders.",

    "title": "THE ATTRIBUTES OF EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND ITS IMPACT ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT There is a debate of whether Emotional Intelligence is born or made when it comes to the field of higher education and students ‘academic performance The question that arises is: whether students should build on their practical and analytical knowledge transferred by theory only or they should acquire more Emotional Intelligence skills? The new paradigm of thinking encompasses creative and Emotional Intelligence as essential building blocks in most organisations. The current competitive environment implies on students to perform multiple tasks with efficiency and effectiveness, their academic knowledge and theory only will not help facing challenges but their right attitude and Emotional Intelligence towards circumstances will definitely be the added value needed for them to face complexities of life. These skills help to lead with impact for a future generation able to combine the Intellectual intelligence (IQ), inherited capacity which enables cognitive skills to be learned and the Emotional Intelligence (EI) not only as a concept or theory learned but as an agile tool applied for leveraging the standards of academic achievement. EI is a supplement in this sense to both Analytical and Practical intelligence. The underlying assumption of this research in hand is advocating that if academic performance deals with ambiguity and challenge, therefore Emotional Intelligence -whether inherited traits or acquired skills- is needed for a student to excel academically. On the academic level, this paper aims at identifying the effect of Emotional Intelligence on students’ academic performance in British education system. It will enable further and wider research in the field of education to deliver more findings on a more comparative scale. The information might be of interest to elaborate on more private as well as public higher education institutions as the survey will only include students from the Business department in the BAEPS faculty at the British university in Egypt. On the practical level, in the wave of Educational reform in Egypt and under the umbrella of 2030 strategy it is crucial to run such study to clarify the impact of EI on the quality of academic achievement for students and to encourage all educational institutions to enhance these skills to increase their students’ academic performance. The research could be upgraded to be applied on the business sector institutions in the field of business in general as today organisations are looking for employees – who are the future graduate students- who have the necessary knowledge as well as skills to deal with challenging situations.

The concept of self is an inevitable consequence of recursive social reasoning, but it is bound to cause logical paradox due to its self-reference. Broadly speaking, self is an example of metacognition, namely, a consequence of cognition applied to evaluate other cognitive processes, which includes the feeling of knowing and other abilities to select the optimal decision-making strategies. As the number and complexity of different learning strategies increase, this also produces undesirable side effects, including negative emotions, such as disappointment and regret, as well as potential failures of metacognition, which might manifest as mental illnesses.",

    "title": "Towards a balanced social psychology: Causes, consequences, and cures for the problem-seeking approach to social behavior and cognition",
    "abstract": "Mainstream social psychology focuses on how people characteristically violate norms of action through social misbehaviors such as conformity with false majority judgments, destructive obedience, and failures to help those in need. Likewise, they are seen to violate norms of reasoning through cognitive errors such as misuse of social information, self-enhancement, and an over-readiness to attribute dispositional characteristics. The causes of this negative research emphasis include the apparent informativeness of norm violation, the status of good behavior and judgment as unconfirmable null hypotheses, and the allure of counter-intuitive findings. The shortcomings of this orientation include frequently erroneous imputations of error, findings of mutually contradictory errors, incoherent interpretations of error, an inability to explain the sources of behavioral or cognitive achievement, and the inhibition of generalized theory. Possible remedies include increased attention to the complete range of behavior and judgmental accomplishment, analytic reforms emphasizing effect sizes and Bayesian inference, and a theoretical paradigm able to account for both the sources of accomplishment and of error. A more balanced social psychology would yield not only a more positive view of human nature, but also an improved understanding of the bases of good behavior and accurate judgment, coherent explanations of occasional lapses, and theoretically grounded suggestions for improvement.",

    "abstract": "The influence of complex cognitive processes on the decision-making is an extremely important factor in the field of emergency medicine, as it is closely related to the environmental, cultural and functional characteristics of the system. The article analyses the group, organisational and emotive aspects that interfere with the effectiveness of emergency staff, the role of intuition in analytical operating models, and the interrelations with the areas (cortical and subcortical) of the brain involved in decisional conflict situations. There are members of the emergency teams who are the organisers of the process, and who monitor it; they share the difficulty to act, as well as procedures, and guarantee the &ldquo;local knowledge&rdquo;, which often deals with limited information, emergencies and unexpected events in the clinic. The various professional roles involved in the decision-making process itself use diagnostic instruments and personal experience, which often makes use of a psychic function, namely, intuition. Intuition is an unconscious process that allows access to a large number of models, information, and data learnt and stored in the long-term memory, without the need for any clear conscious cognitive effort. In this context, the characteristics of intuition and its function and reliability are investigated, as are the value of heuristics in making decisions and its role in different cognitive styles. Improving the outcomes of the decision-making process and the levels of safety in an emergency requires shared rules and operating procedures, knowledge of the situation, awareness of the human tendency to make cognitive and emotional distortions, and an ability to blend, safely, intuitive cognitive and analytical styles, depending on the task at hand.",

Use of a conceptual framework for the assessment of decisional capacity can facilitate neuropsychological assessment of the four fundamental cognitive abilities that are involved in decisional capacity: understanding, appreciation, reasoning or formulating, and communicating a choice. Such capacity assessments are often part of a broader neuropsychological evaluation. The goal of this chapter is to provide neuropsychologists pragmatic guidance for capacity assessments, including a conceptual approach, an understanding of cognitive and functional issues, and information about assessment tools and report writing. Although neuropsychologists are asked to address a variety of capacity-related questions, this chapter focuses on the capacity to make medical decisions and the capacity to manage finances. The assessment processes illustrated for these decisions and abilities can be applied to other questions of capacity. Effective clinicians perform appropriate evaluations and arrive at sound decisions that balance respect for the examinee's autonomy with preservation of their safety and wellbeing.",

The language of inquiring systems is employed to describe differences in the conditions under which a problem can be considered solved. Differences in inquiring systems are outlined along the dimensions of the decision theory and structure terminology defined above. Formal operations and other well-structured problem-solving skills are compared to post-adolescent cognitive development, which deals with the ability to solve ill-structured problems.

    "abstract": "Situational approach to the analysis of activity of the personality in activity opens new opportunities for the analysis of individual life experience of the personality. In the present article the method of diagnostics and the analysis of loneliness as life situation is offered. The inventory \"Assessment of situational activity of the adult personality (ASA)\" allows to correlate primary categorization of a life situation – her assessment as daily, significant or difficult and type of behavioral strategy – adaptive, active and adaptive, coping-activity and hipercoping-activity (the allocated E.A. Belan special type of activity, an extreme form of mastering the expressed imbalance of personal and situational determination of activity); and also to diagnose 4 components of situational activity of the personality: physiological, mental, behavioral and reflexive. In total they make individual and estimated model of a situation. The fact of experience in itself of loneliness as life situation is less informative for understanding of individually special processes of activity of the personality especially as for the observer they are hidden in individual consciousness and aren't always distinctly realized by the personality. Meanwhile, primary categorization of a situation of loneliness, namely, perception by her personality as daily, significant or difficult, exerts impact on subjective characteristics of experience of loneliness. However the direct behavioral strategy of the personality in a situation of loneliness isn't interconnected with subjective characteristics of experience of loneliness that contradicts logic of situational activity of the personality. Given a contradiction causes need of accounting of individual and estimated model of a situation for the analysis of genesis of situational activity of the personality for a loneliness situation. It is shown that characteristics of individual and estimated model of a situation influence experiences and psychological states of the personality who is in this situation, ambiguously. The practice focused conclusions which can set the direction of psychological escort of the personality in situations of experience of loneliness are presented.",

    "title": "The principle of employability as a fundamental tool for managing people with disabilities and/or vulnerabilities",
    "abstract": "Introduction. Employability is a set of conditions—skills, understanding, and personal attributes (including physical and mental health)—that make individuals more likely to perform a particular job and succeed in their assigned occupations, benefiting themselves, their coworkers, the community, and the business and social economy.Disability refers to a person who has a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and medium- to long-term negative effect on their ability to perform normal daily activities, including work.The aim of those involved in employability management is to ensure its applicability to people with disabilities as defined by the social security system or by the work suitability requirements/restrictions formulated by occupational physicians. This objective must be achieved through a road map of practical and feasible solutions to enable all workers to be truly included in the work process, ensuring well-being and productivity.Objectives. Anyone with physical, mental, and/or cognitive limitations or who is otherwise diverse (including personal characteristics of the workforce such as age, sex, gender identity, and ethnic origin) must be allowed to work safely and productively by reducing occupational risks and eliminating the obstacles that stand in the way of this project.The objective should be achieved by designing and implementing workstations that comply with threshold limits for physical work, cognitive and mental demands, and by early detection of physical and mental functional deficits in work capacity.The first step is a proactive preventive approach to avoid having people with limitations and/or disabilities as a result of work activity. The second step is reactive and positive management of workers with disabilities/prescriptions and work fitness limitations.In fact, not all workers can achieve the same productivity as a person without a disability or impairment, even with technical or organizational ergonomic measures, due to the high level of disability. These workers must also be included in the employability management process.The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, adopted in New York on December 13, 2006, uses “reasonable accommodation” as a synonym for employability. Reasonable accommodation consists of “necessary and appropriate modifications and adjustments” to ensure “the right to work of persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others.” . The United Nations' goal is to have “decent work” for all people.The principles established by the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union on April 11, 2013, can be extended globally and to the extent of “reasonable accommodation”/ employability and could be applied, taking into account local legislation, not only to those who are recognized as disabled and handicapped by specific public bodies in accordance with the legislation of each country, but also to any worker suffering from a condition that compromises their full fitness for work, regardless of whether the disability is certified. Disability should not be assessed solely on the basis of the diagnosis of diseases, but by considering the overall residual functional capacity of each person and using standardized and validated questionnaires such as the ICF short version.Results. There are several critical issues to be addressed in order to achieve a common global approach to managing employability:Different legislation in different countries Resistance to accepting workers with severe disabilities or prescriptions/limitations that significantly limit their fitness for work (even if only in the short term) Different approaches are used in different countries for risk assessment.Different tools are used to assess the risk associated with ‘ergonomic problems’.Different criteria adopted to formulate the prescription/restriction by the occupational physician.Consequently, the difficulties are:Adopting a common strategy to map the risks associated with workstations.Having a standardized approach to link the workstation analysis phase with the phase relating to the worker's specific limitations in order to proceed with work reintegration. Properly managing the principles of employability.The employability of people requires awareness, knowledge, and commitment on the part of managers and leaders. They are key stakeholders in the efficiency of the employability management process. For this reason, one of the main issues is to provide and expand the culture of integration among leaders and managers to ensure that work is adapted to people with disabilities and specific physical/mental needs.The approach to correct employability management is summarized in the flowchart below. IMAGE By following the process shown in the flowchart, it is possible to identify certain priorities.For the Worker/Restriction Phase:All restrictions assigned to a worker to safeguard their health must be standardized using a code that can be linked to each workstation (at least country by country). Standardize the meaning of work requirements and restrictions between different sites/countries using a common language.The Workstation phase requires:Risk exposure data must be coded (chemical agents, vibrations, biomechanical overload) to map each workstation. The coding of risk exposure depends on the strategy adopted for risk assessment and must be linkable to the worker's restriction.The allocation phase will be the result of an analysis of the compatibility between the results of the cross-evaluation of the work phase and the workstation phase; in the event of incompatibility, it will be necessary to analyze how to adapt (if possible) the workstation with engineering or administrative solutions.The assessment of compatibility between the disability or chronic condition and the workplace can be expressed through a work plan defined in agreement with the worker's manager (team leader, supervisor, human resources member) based on the occupational physician's recommendations, supported by ergonomists in the event of ergonomic issues, and considering the health/ propensity of the worker, who modulates/avoids work activities/tasks that could be harmful or aggravate the worker's health conditions.Only if it is not possible to adapt the workplace or identify a personal work plan will it be necessary to identify a new job/work position. This is because it is necessary to consider the difficulty, often associated with the lack of guarantees of maintaining productivity on the one hand and acceptability/professional satisfaction on the other.Following the process shown in the flowchart, it is possible to identify some priorities.For the Worker/Restriction Phase:All restrictions assigned to a worker to safeguard their health must be standardized using a code that can be linked to each workstation (at least country by country). Standardize the meaning of work requirements and restrictions between different sites/countries using a common language.The Workstation phase requires:Risk exposure data must be coded (chemical agents, vibrations, biomechanical overload) to map each workstation.

    "title": "An Inquiry Into Certain Human Determinants of Organizational Creativity.",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the human determinants of organizational creativity.Information is derived from the reports of scientists, administrators, and educators, who are intensifying study of this topic.An understanding of the creative process facilitates apprecia tion of the nature of creative work, appraisal of creativity training programs, evaluation of environmental factors, and utilization of operational techniques.The creative process consists of seven interdependent and interweaving stages: early preparation, in which the mind assimilates great volumes of diverse information; intense encounter with the problem; conscious probing into the problem, its factors, and possible solutions; incubation, wherein subconscious processes attack the problem; illumination, the conscious recognition of momentous insight; verification or elaboration of the idea; and gaining acceptance of the creation.Recent psychological studies have isolated traits underlying creative ability.Tests are in use which measure these traits.Prominent traits of the creative person are intelligence, sensitivity fluency, flexibility, originality, and redefinition.He tends to be inner directed, sensitive to his own emotions, independent, selfconfident, dominating, and inhibited by exacting internal standards.He manifests a personality sufficiently integrated to reconcile viii ix internal ambiguities.Slight variations in personality profiles may determine the fields in which individuals excel creatively.Creativity normally declines gradually with age, after reaching a peak, usually between 25 and 40 years of age.Evidence suggests that creative ability may be increased through training.Participation in brainstorming sessions is found to increase ideational fluency and the production of good quality ideas.Other training techniques seem to enhance originality, sometimes at the expense of ideational fluency.Laboratory evidence suggests that subjects can be trained to be more original, that such behavior can be reinforced, and that such training has enduring effects.Environmental factors may encourage or inhibit creativity.In the creative environment, administrators evince a sincere desire for creativity and work toward achieving pervasive communications, flexible schedules, and some relief from routine work.The past is not w o r shipped, but regarded as a step toward a greater future.Incentives are based upon administrative insights into the need hierarchies and abilities of subordinates.The tendency toward conformity within groups m a y be weakened through manipulating group composition and attraction, and through encouraging productive interaction patterns.Full group participation and tolerance of goal-directed disagreement facilitate creative decisions.Augmenting general organizational creativity are techniques designed to help solve specific problems.Thought provokers (analytical techniques, forced choice techniques, and checklists) may aid indivi duals to visualize novel solutions not otherwise perceived.Group assault upon appropriate problems is also practiced, particularly brainstorming.Objective evidence suggests that brainstorming is a superior conference technique for obtaining many diverse ideas about open-end problems.It seems, however, that individual brainstorming may excel group brainstorming in number of ideas produced and number of good quality ideas.Worthy of watching is the Gordon technique, wherein a permanent panel is gradually informed of the problem during the session.To maximize organizational creativity, an integrated program appears advisable, including the use of material contained herein to staff the organization with creative personnel, to develop the creative abilities and propensities of all personnel, to provide a climate conducive to creativity, and to select judiciously from among operational techniques.",

    "abstract": "Only knowledge is not sufficient to make students succeed in the world. Students need to attain 21st century skills like problem-solving, creativity, innovation, metacognition, communication etc. to endure in the modern world. Problem-solving skill is one of the fundamental human cognitive processes. Whenever students face a situation where they do not know the way to complete a task, the problem occurs. Problem-solving is a process, which involves systematic observation and critical thinking to find an appropriate solution or way to reach the desired goal. The framework of problem-solving consisted of two major skills: observation and critical thinking skill. Observation skill refers to collecting data, understanding and interpreting the meaning of the information using all the senses. Critical thinking involves the individual’s ability to do the following: conceptualizing, logical reasoning, applying strategy, analytical thinking, decision making and synthesizing to solve any problem.",

    "title": "Understanding head injury and intellectual recovery from brain damage: is IQ an adequate measure?",
    "abstract": "A person's intelligence (or IQ) has long been synonymous with cognitive and general abilities to function daily on an effective level. When traumatic brain injury occurs, there is a natural desire to find some measure that identifies the amount of damage that has occurred and whether it is permanent or temporary. Given the popularity of the IQ test, there is a tendency to use this measure as such a yardstick. It is argued that such a global measure is not appropriate. The predominant reason that it is not a wise choice is that IQ test does not tap into many of the critical areas of a person's functioning, such as personality regulation, shorter-term memory, various types of attentional capacity, and the ability to organize and plan effectively. Rather, to truly and accurately reflect a person's neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses requires the use of many different measures, not just a single one such as an IQ score.",

To better adapt to the changing environment and daily challenges, people need to learn new skills and knowledge by practicing repetitively. The learning effect mainly depends on brain plasticity during training, and decreases over time due to becoming tired, losing energy, and failing to sustain attention. Cognitive fatigue (CF) is about the decrement in mental effort or self-motivation when engaging in cognitively demanding tasks.

Examining these tasks offers insights into dyslexia's underlying mechanisms and its impact on cognitive functioning. Compre-hending the interplay between neurocognitive processes and dyslexia is crucial for tailored interventions. Identifying deficits and strengths in these domains helps design intervention pro-grams that address individual needs.

    "abstract": "This article discusses the psychological impact of leisure across a lifetime using a life-course perspective, which assumes that people’s experiences at earlier life stages shape their following developmental trajectories. Since leisure activities are part of one’s lifestyle, adopting this perspective to leisure research is invaluable. By reviewing a variety of research, the article discusses 1) the progress of psychological leisure research and the impact of leisure on subjective well-being and cognitive functioning, 2) transitions in leisure and their relationship from a life-course perspective, and 3) the benefits related to the accumulation of leisure activities across the lifespan. The present review concludes that positive psychological achievement (e.g., self-worth, affirmation, and self-realization) and cognitive foundation (e.g., high levels of basic cognitive skills) shaped through leisure participation in early life stages help overcome challenges in later stages (i.e., successfully adapt to psychological vulnerability and cognitive decline in old age).",

    "title": "Metacognition’s potential for Existentialism in classrooms",
    "abstract": "Abstract The instrumentality and standardization of education may be important for functioning in contemporary societies. However, reducing education to measurable competencies may result in the loss of human value. Indeed, education becomes real when it relates to the reality of individuals. Existentialist education focuses on students’ freedom and agency; however, it is criticized for not having coherent and convincing educational guides. This analytical comparison paper argues that the premises of Existentialism and the components of metacognition may interact. While metacognitive awareness and thinking for essence lays the ground for individuality and autonomy, metacognitive knowledge relates to self-knowledge and not accepting ready-made concepts through self-questioning and dialogic encounters. Also, metacognitive experiences might mimic existential crises where individuals engage in highly conscious thinking during which metacognitive knowledge and regulation simultaneously help the individual deal with failure or anxiety. During such experiences, metacognitive regulation might facilitate individuals’ free choices and responsible engagement when building the self or handling difficulties. In this sense, enhancing metacognition may help individuals’ transition to the existing phase by building adequate self-knowledge and regulating thinking. This paper, finally, describes a set of pedagogies for fostering metacognition that could potentially facilitate existential attitudes or behaviors in mainstream classrooms.",

    "title": "The Relationship Between Student Development Theory and a Professional Abilities Model for Physical Therapy Education",
    "abstract": "Background and Purpose. Generic abilities define a repertoire of behaviors deemed essential for success in the physical therapy profession. Many physical therapist education programs have adopted some form of the generic abilities to foster and measure development of professional behaviors by students. Methods proposed for fostering development of professional behaviors include explicit instruction, role modeling, mentoring, guided reflection, and individual advising. Understanding of the cognitive and psychosocial development of individual students and appreciation of the impact of the developmental level on readiness to learn may help guide educators in choosing the most appropriate interventions for students across the spectrum of maturity and throughout the developmental process. The purpose of this article is to examine a model of generic abilities from the perspective of student development theory. Position and Rationale. Descriptors and sample behaviors of a model of generic abilities were analyzed in terms of the major tenets of 4 theories of intellectual and ethical development, cognitive development, and moral development. Aspects of psychosocial and identity development appear linked to all of the professional abilities. Cognitive development seems closely linked to behaviors of problem solving and critical thinking. Moral development may influence broad areas of professionalism, responsibility, and social responsibility. Discussion and Conclusion. An understanding of broad aspects of psychosocial, cognitive, and moral development may enhance the effectiveness of physical therapy faculty in nurturing development of professional behaviors in physical therapist students. The developmental process may be enhanced by fostering an environment that provides essential challenges and appropriate support for students across all 3 domains of development throughout the physical therapy curriculum.",

    "title": "Significance of self-efficacy model in educational work with adolescents",
    "abstract": "The frame of reference in this paper is based on Bandura's concept of self-efficacy. The theory of self-efficacy is based on the importance of subjective experience of personal competence in realizing different goals and tasks, rather than on real knowledge and skills. It supports reciprocal causation according to which a person is observed holistically through dynamic effect of personal factors (cognitive, emotional and biological), factors of the environment and behavior. Development of self-efficacy strongly determines future behavior of a person in achieving goals, since it initiates action, determines the amount of required effort, persistence in facing obstacles, and resilience in unwanted situations. Many different scales are used in assessing selfefficacy (e.g. Children's Self-Efficacy Scale, Parents' Self-Efficacy Scale, Teachers' Self-Efficacy Scale, etc.). They consist of several subscales that can greatly contribute to understanding adolescents and predicting their functioning, depending on the assessed contextual area. Previous researches confirmed the influence of students' selfefficacy on their academic achievements, professional aspirations, and prosocial behavior. In the last couple of years there have been more and more researches which analyze the role of self-efficacy in behavioral disorders, such as peer aggression, cigarette smoking, drug abuse, excessive use of the Internet, etc.",

    "title": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: implications for the classroom teacher",
    "abstract": "This article is the culmination of field observations, discussions with classroom teachers and a review of the existing research base for meeting the classroom needs of students with attention deficit hyperactive disordered needs. Specifically the article describes strategies that classroom teachers can utilize to better meet the attention needs of their students with attention deficit hyperactive disordered needs. Every strategy is discussed in terms of how the strategy should be implemented and this discussion is followed by a heading in which current research findings that relate to the strategy are briefly discussed. ********** Students labeled attention deficit hyperactive disordered (ADHD) display many characteristics that make the sustaining of attention problematic (Welton, 1999). Some of these characteristics include but are not limited to: (1) often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork; (2) often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork; (3) often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly; (4) often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities; and (5) often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort such as schoolwork or homework (Accardo, Blondis, Stein, & Whitman, 2000). However, in order to fully understand these characteristics, it is important to first understand the different parts that make-up the process of attention. For example, the process of attention demands that the learner focus that is pick or select something that needs attention. However, in order for the learner to be able to sustain or pay attention for as long as the required task demands, the learner must be able to resist or avoid things that remove his or her attention from where it needs to be. Depending upon the classroom situation, the learner may also need to shift or to move his or her attention to something else when the task demand requires slight modification. In this article, several strategies will be described that can be used by the teacher to better engage the attention of students with ADHD in his or her classroom. These strategies were created after several periods of observing students with ADHD and after several meeting with three classroom teachers that had students labeled as having ADHD in their classrooms. Strategy #1: To increase the use of positive reinforcement This strategy calls the classroom teacher' s attention to the frequency in which the student with ADHD receives negative comments or even punishments. When observing a student labeled ADHD, it was quite common to witness the teacher berating the student for his or her lack of focused attention, talking out of turn as well as participating in distracting behaviors like the clicking of a pen or the bending of a paper clip. However, once the teachers were shown the frequency in which they had delivered negative comments and we had an opportunity to discuss the replacement of these negative comments with positive verbal reinforcement (such as, You keep improving!; Wow, you have completed half of the page, I know you'll get the rest done by the end of the period!; Sensational effort, keep up the good work!). The teachers were truly amazed at the effort the students demonstrated in response to the positive comments was well as a decrease in the frequency in which negative behaviors occurred. Current Research Findings The use of positive verbal praise goes a long way toward fostering better self-esteem for learners with ADHD (McCluskey & McCluskey, 1999). A student's self-esteem or self-worth is fostered when the teacher creates a classroom environment in which the student with ADHD feels his or her efforts will be recognized. Through such recognition, the student with ADHD can perceive that they have competencies and that they will succeed at school-related tasks. …",

Correlational research has demonstrated that social rejection and low intellectual performance are related, as loneliness is associated with poor cognitive functioning. Experimental research has shed light on the correlational findings, as participants assigned to be rejected performed slowly and inaccurately on reasoning problems relative to participants assigned to control conditions. Hence, social rejection reduces intelligent thought. Evidence also indicates that rejection reduces self-control, as people who are rejected perform poorly on a wealth of self-control tasks.",

The adult population has about 50% probability of suffering of at least one episode of mental illness during their lifetime. The bearer of mental illness is seen as a different individual, unable to perform certain functions and even as a threat to society, conditions that increase their personal suffering, the fear of being rejected, despised and undervalued leading to its progressive social exclusion. Discriminatory attitudes undermine the harmonious coexistence among all, in our daily lives. The distortion and lack of information about mental illness can cause increasing stigma. Patients attempt to hide their problem for fear of being left out in different areas of your life. The demystification of incurability, dangerousness and disability of mental patients should be a priority. To change the way you think and see the other, we should meet the primary objectives: emancipation of the patient with mental disorder; reduction of discrimination and stigma; improvement of individual social competence and creating a social support system for long duration. The fact that we ignore our ghosts does not eliminate them. There should be made an effort to improve inclusion and not exclusion. The entire community is to be responsible for the rehabilitation and cure of the mental patient.",

    "abstract": "Introduction:   Decision   Capacity   Assessment is one of the functions of consultation psychiatry.  It  involves  the  ability  to  make choices autonomously and arises in a relevant way in clinical practice as a precondition to informed consent.Aims:  The  authors  pretend  to  review  the process underlying decision capacity assessment, as well as other relevant information published in this regard.Methods: Non systematic review of the literature, through electronic search in Medline/Pubmed.Results: The ability to decide can only be assessed  in  relation  to  a  particular  decision,  and  its  outcome  is  not  necessarily stable  over  time.  Similarly,  there  is  no single  diagnosis  that  allows  concluding for  incapacity,  nor  dispensing  its  proper evaluation.  It  depends  on  various  factors like  the  thought  content,  thinking  process or  cognitive  functions.  It  can  also  be  influenced by the individual’s level of edu- cation, personality traits, emotional states/ coping mechanisms or circumstantial factors. Every doctor should be able to carry out this evaluation. The liaison psychiatrist should  be  involved  in  case  of  suspected mental illness that can impair the ability to  consent  or  before  the  need  to  validate an assessment already taken. Appelbaum and Grisso proposed a systematic evaluation  based  on  the  following  criteria:  a) communication  of  choice,  b)  understanding, c) appreciation and d) rational decision making. In an attempt to minimize differences between evaluators, several assessment  instruments  were  developed, among  which  the  MacArthur  Competence Assessment  Tool  assumes  a  special  focus. Mini  Mental  State  Examination  has  also been  used  in  patients  with  cognitive  impairment, emerging proposals for correlating the scores obtained with the presence of decision-making. When a patient is unable to decide, it should be respected his best interest, and seek a “replacement decision”, with respect for ethics and the law.Conclusions: A patient who is able to deci- de must present: a) attention focused on the problem; b) ability to consider the different options proposed; c) ability to assess the risks and  benefits  and  d   ability  to  anticipate their possible results.",

    "abstract": "The learning principles usually not visually. The visual understood as an analytical and facilitate an idea. That is the visual is parallel to other representation. The visual ability is not only a tool, or a strategy, or a type of thinking, but also the chain of reasoning to achieve the formal analytic abilities. In this study, the visual ability examined, as a strategy or way of thinking to solve a problem. The question to be addressed is: How do students come to their mathematics identities based on visual imagery? The research conducted at classes of the preservice mathematics education students namely provides evidence for what is their identity relative to their experiences. The results conducted based on explorative studies for the visual abilities. The performance obtained during the teaching and learning, i.e., visualizing and answering analytically or visually, manipulating and answering analytically or visually or by formulas, and visualizing and the answering visually or analytically or based on the conditions. The performance linked to the visual representation and related to intuition underlies formal abilities. The visual perceptions disturbed by prior knowledge, and the level based on optical illusions, so the teaching and learning make a difference between potential and abilities. The analytical affects visual perception and the belief system, so difficult to construct knowledge. However, the level of thinking is different, i.e., not yet formal or new optical illusion. The visual model related to high-level thinking, which distinguished from the analytical thinking model. In the visual model, thinking activities based on the transformations and understood as the other operations in mathematics. The visual model also shows the analytic thinking and hierarchical. The visual and the analytical thinking integrated to develop a richer understanding of mathematical concepts. Through visual thinking, the mental processing was constructed and interpreted as mental objects and processed analytically. The next, exhibits the analytical, consist of the construction process from the visual, namely the reflective abstractions. The visual abilities not related to the duration of courses in the mathematics education department. The longer increases the analytic but in contrary to the visual. Through the learning of the visual abilities, the difficulties in solving the problems decrease, but resistant to the analytic show a specific performance. Visual learning reveals a hierarchical level of the thinking, so the best performance is the highest learning ability. When learning the visual abilities given, the performance increases.",

It impacts one's capacity to comprehend and communicate in both spoken and written language, perform mathematical computations, harmonize physical movements, and focus attention effectively. Children having learning disabilities might take more time to comprehend what is being taught than others. This might place them at a risk for poor academic performance causing them to have low self-esteem. The model is to detect children with learning disabilities, classify them into different categories, and then suggest certain exercises and suggestions to improve their condition hence motivating them and improving their self-esteem.",

    "abstract": "People with cognitive disabilities may experience challenges in consistently performing daily activities because they skip steps, struggle to track progress, or lack the motivation to complete them. These challenges are often along a range; people need assistive devices customized to their specific needs. However, existing assistive technologies, like prompting systems, lack the capabilities to customize support for diverse needs. With the advent of smart home devices, there are opportunities to design prompting systems that support diverse accessibility and motivational needs, thereby supporting the regular practice of daily activities. To understand design factors for such devices, we interviewed adults with cognitive disabilities, parents, and caregivers. Our participants described their needs for future prompting systems, including structuring tasks, supporting motivation, and introducing community support. This paper presents insights and design suggestions for context-aware assistive technologies that could help people with cognitive disabilities regularly perform everyday activities.",

    "title": "Cognition, Metacognition, and Self-Regulated Learning",
    "abstract": "Psychology’s attention to mental events took root in the middle of the 19th century and grew through studies of learning, forgetting, and problem solving. Following several decades during which behaviorism dominated the field, cognitive studies of learning rapidly expanded after the mid-1960s. Foci for research concerned how learners acquire different kinds information, particularly declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and schemas, and identifying cognitive operations learners can apply to transform experience into knowledge. What learners know significantly shapes what they learn. Prior knowledge often benefits learning, but inaccurate knowledge, called misconceptions, and skills applied indiscriminately can impede it. Effort to learn, called cognitive load, is not a unary concept. Designing learning tasks to focus cognition in ways germane to content is one key to effective instruction. Learners can think about their cognition and its properties. This is metacognition. Examples include judgments of whether and what is learned, planning shaped by the relative success in tasks and affective experiences, and decisions to abandon risky or unproductive tasks. Measures of metacognition, predominantly learners’ reports as opposed to direct indicators, correlate modestly with achievement, but this may reflect that students are not often educated in study tactics and learning strategies. Metacognition is a key factor in learners’ decisions about which study tactics and learning strategies they use, and a challenge learners face is overcoming overconfidence about what they know. The metacognitive decision-making event is modeled as an <sc>If–Then</sc> production. Metacognitive control of how learners choose to go about learning is conditional on metacognitive monitoring of conditions the learner believes will influence learning processes and outcomes. When learners experiment with approaches to learning, they engage in self-regulated learning (SRL). SRL is a very energetic area of research that spans investigations into learners’ metacognition about conditions for learning, operations on information, products resulting from those operations, and evaluations of products in terms of standards the learner holds; the COPES model. Like its foundation in metacognition, SRL also correlates modestly with achievement and is similarly challenged by relying on learners’ self-reports about SRL. However, learners can be taught how to better apply SRL which may realize benefits to achievement.",

    "abstract": "The article states that goal-setting is an integral formation, the meaning of life, on the way of self-realization, by means of which a person regulates and organizes his own life. It is demonstrated that in the structure of the ability to goal-setting there are the following components: intellectual, personal, activity. The personal (individual-personal qualities, value system) and activity (volitional qualities) components in women at different stages of self-realization have been studied and compared. It is established that students who are at the stage of self-understanding and self-perception are not capable of responsible goal setting because they have an ideal self-image, overestimated self-esteem, underdeveloped reflection and reduced efficiency of adaptation, conflict of values (universalism - achievement, security - independence, independence - comfort), a pessimistic view of future-oriented events without developed volitional qualities. It was found that female students have certain goals, but are not always able to present a more or less clear picture of the desired future, so the ultimate goal may not be justified and is unstable. It is shown that women at the stage of selfrealization live in the present, have a real idea of themselves, they lack full self-satisfaction, which with a strong self-esteem and generally positive assessment of their personality encourages respondents to further self-improvement. It has been shown that women use volitional qualities when achieving goals, have a conflict of values (stimulation - security), which is characteristic of mature adaptive individuals, with a certain level of dignity and flexibility.",

La relación de uno consigo mismo es crucial de cara al funcionamiento efectivo. Aprender a mantener una relación productiva con uno mismo ante los problemas es la meta de la psicoterapia.

    "abstract": "Abstract Theoretical and empirical efforts to develop valid methods by which to identify people with mental retardation and related disabilities have been underway for approximately 100 years. Recently, there is a growing consensus that mental retardation is best conceptualized as significant limitations in the multidimensional construct of personal competence. In addition to physical competence, personal competence is conceptualized to include, at the broadest level of conceptualization, the domains of conceptual, practical, and social intelligence. Due to limitations in personal competence, the defining characteristic of persons with mental retardation is an ongoing need for types and intensities of support that most others in society do not require. Current models of personal competence are described and the types of measurement tools available to measure essential dimensions of personal competence are discussed. Additionally, a systematic approach is described for assessing support needs and developing plans to meet these needs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Social cognition focuses on the mental processes involved in social interactions. In the participatory planning process, which puts into use the knowledge and skills of individuals through active interaction, the study of social cognitive abilities seems relevant. The objective of this article is to review the social cognitive factors and their implications in participatory planning and designing. Social cognitions are observed early in childhood and they develop over decades through experience. It appears that they are partially independent of formal intelligence. The existing data suggests that social cognition may have a biological basis in the form of neurophysiological substrates and genetic loci. Social cognitions help in comprehending, adjusting interpretations, thinking of multiple alternatives, social problem solving and in various other processes. Social cognitions are instrumental in dealing with a variety of interpersonal problems observed during interactions in the group and in coping with potential stressors like negative outcomes. Various factors like positive mood states, belief in self‐efficacy and goals may affect social cognition and planning and decision‐making processes. These findings suggest that practitioners and researchers of participatory change processes should pay attention to social cognition. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

    "title": "Self‐reported inner speech use in university students",
    "abstract": "Summary Remarkably little is known regarding what people talk to themselves about (inner speech use) in their everyday lives. Existing self‐directed speech measures (e.g., thought sampling and questionnaires) either uniquely capture inner speech frequency and neglect its content or classify self‐reported thoughts instances in overly simplistic categories determined by the researchers. In the current study, we describe an open‐format thought listing procedure as well as a refined coding scheme and present detailed inner speech content self‐generated by 76 university students. The most frequently self‐reported inner speech activities were self‐regulation (e.g., planning and problem solving), self‐reflection (e.g., emotions, self‐motivation, appearance, behavior/performance, and autobiography), critical thinking (e.g., evaluating, judging, and criticizing), people in general, education, and current events. Inner speech occurred most commonly while studying and driving. These results are consistent with the self‐regulatory and self‐referential functions of inner speech often emphasized in the literature. Future research avenues using the open‐format inner speech listing procedure and coding scheme are proposed.",

Les stratégies en prévention et en promotion de la santé mentale mises de l’avant dans les établissements d’enseignement postsecondaire offrent les plus belles possibilités de rejoindre un grand nombre de jeunes adultes. Cependant, malgré l’intérêt grandissant pour de telles initiatives en milieu scolaire, les méta-analyses et les revues des écrits scientifiques recensés mettent en lumière les difficultés reliées à l’évaluation des stratégies utilisées et aux possibilités de répliquer les interventions, particulièrement en ce qui a trait à la promotion. Les stratégies les plus efficaces sur le plan de l’amélioration de la santé mentale semblent être associées à la supervision d’exercices en lien avec l’intervention telles que les exercices de pleine conscience ( mindfulness ), les techniques cognitives-comportementales, la relaxation et le développement d’habiletés sociales.

    "abstract": "Humans have an exquisite set of psychological processes available to direct their attention and actions in order to prioritize, organize, and target their emotions and behaviors in a goal-oriented manner. Executive functions, which include working memory, inhibitory control, and attentional shifting are fundamental to cognitive strategies supporting effective self-regulation of emotions and behaviors. Executive functions include cognitive processes associated with working memory, inhibitory control, and attentional shifting. Deficits in these cognitive processes are found along with the dysregulated emotionality characteristic of anxiety disorders and depression. Effective emotion regulation is associated with prosocial behavior, social connections, strong working memory, and better physical and mental health. Executive functions – attentional shifting, working memory, and inhibitory control – are the underlying cognitive processes supporting effective self-regulation of emotions and behaviors. Anxiety disorders are associated with deficits in each of the traditional constructs of executive functions as well as cognitive reappraisal.",

    "abstract": "Purpose As corporate life is influenced by various things, there is no justifiable reason to believe that the spiritual power (capacity) should not be one of them. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to argue that workers need to develop another core competency, knowledge and skill, that is, spiritual intelligence (SI). Design/methodology/approach This paper draws on a literature review to support its conclusions. In this sense, this paper carefully examines relevant popular and academic books, handbooks, articles, papers, thesis and doctoral dissertations related to SI. In addition, this paper depicts a conceptual model of SI that is made up of some research propositions, namely, professional moral courage, altruism, hope state, optimism, cooperative capacity, organizational justice mindset and listening skill. Findings Overall, the literature review suggests that without such a capacity, we would be enjoying merely impoverished lives (here referred to as the outcome of a set of harmful aspects such as an existence without spiritual compass, meaning, worthy purposes and desire to face the shadows of our own personality). Practical implications This paper proposes that SI is the path to reach and develop our own spirituality. When this ability is triggered, we are potentially able to make some important contributions to the people that live around and rely on us. Originality/value This paper argues that SI can be regarded as a human capacity that connects us with the ultimate frontier, that is, the spiritual realm. As such, it is proposed that it can be cultivated over time in a careful and disciplined way by anyone that is really interested in developing his or her spirituality.",

    "abstract": "The demands of the world today have opened the field to the study of emotional intelligence, within the integral formation of the human being. A considerable number of researches conclude that emotions are a key piece of configuration for personal success, since the recognition and management of one's own and others' emotions results in people who are full and happy. Thus, society and the school are aware of the need for a specific curriculum that favors the identification and management of emotions. Emotions represent the way in which an individual reacts to various situations, learned through experiences and educated throughout the course of life. Emotional competencies regulate the emotional phenomena to which people are exposed daily. They allow students to solve problems and produce products in their different contexts of life. Opting, in this way, for a different way of being intelligent; which departs from the classical definition of rational intelligence, and which approaches the real social context. The development of emotional education in school is one of the most effective psychopedagogical innovations of recent years. Through the application of a plan of contextualized objectives, according to the educational level in which the group of students is located, and under the emotional leadership of the teacher, they respond to different social needs, which are not sufficiently addressed in ordinary academic competences. What means that to choose the diversification of capacities and the development of methodological strategies for the orientation, control and strengthening of the emotional aspect, will be the base of the success to maintain the good human relations and to obtain the personal and professional improvement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Intended to provide an overview of psychological research on life’s meaning for a philosophical readership, this chapter reviews multiple lines of enquiry. People find meaning in diverse places, so the questions (needs for meaning) may be more constant than the answers. Self-rated meaningfulness often emphasizes family, love, work, and religion, some of which seem little more than basic animal drives embellished with meaningfulness. Self-rated meaningfulness rises and falls in response to mundane events, increasing after seeing simple orderly patterns and while performing routines, and decreasing after interpersonal rejection. Searching for meaning is largely uncorrelated with finding or having it. Applying meaning to life may increase its incompleteness. Self-rated happiness correlates with meaningfulness, but important differences exist, including differential relevance of goal satisfaction, time span, interpersonal relations, stressful involvements, and self-expression.",

It is equally true that research questions can also affect how one understands or experiences topical issues in a later personal experience. The researcher's personal experience dealing with a child with attention hyperactivity disorder became a factor in her reaction to the suggestion that she herself was dyslexic. Reflecting on the labeling of people with deficit conditions resulted in increased understanding of her own situation and an altered perception of research objects. No matter how hard the researcher tries to be objective, he or she cannot escape the personal components of the interpretive framework being applied. Research is furthered when those personal constructions are acknowledged and examined. The dialectic between research and researcher cannot be ignored. (Contains 17 references.)

That's the underlying question of our research on the perception of computer science among the general population as to what constitutes their concept of it. Two qualitative studies based on grounded theory [6] lead to the development of a model of different types of situations of contacts (SoC). SoC can be classified as perceived and non-perceived contact situations. If a situation is not consciously perceived, a person's concept of computer science remains unchanged. If a situation is consciously perceived, the concept may evolve. The results show that the perception of computer science can either be classified as a \"tool\" which facilitates an individual's professional and private workflow or as an \"obstacle\", which can arise either from the use of software or other digital tools, or externally through guidelines, technical progress or through purchases by third parties (e.g. children and their environment). The distinction between perceived and non-perceived situations of contact and between a tool and an obstacle relies on an individual complexity rating.",

    "abstract": "Abstract General intelligence (g) is a highly practical ability that affects personal well-being in many aspects of life. This article reviews five key facts documenting its pervasive utility, and then illustrates how higher levels of intelligence enhance an individual’s performance and well-being in four realms of daily life: work, daily self-maintenance, chronic illness, and accidents. The first key fact is that people who do well on one mental test tend to perform well on all of them; that is, all mental tests correlate with one other. All measure mostly the same underlying ability factor, no matter what their manifest content or purpose. Mental abilities differ in their generality-specificity, and the general mental ability factor, g , is the most general of all. Second, high intelligence is expressed as a set of generic thinking skills that includes learning efficiently, reasoning well, thinking abstractly, and solving novel problems. These information-processing skills can be applied to virtually any kind of content in any context. Hence, third, everyday life continually requires individuals to learn and reason well. Fourth, ample evidence shows that general intelligence not only predicts many forms of success and well-being but usually does so better than socioeconomic status. More specific mental abilities add little to prediction beyond that contributed by g alone. Fifth, intelligence predicts performance better when tasks are more complex. Although higher intelligence is somewhat useful in many life arenas, it is particularly advantageous when jobs and daily tasks are more cognitively demanding. It is therefore important to know the distribution of task demands in different life areas. Four life arenas illustrate how more cognitively demanding tasks put less intelligent individuals at greater risk. Job analysis research has repeatedly shown that the major distinction among jobs is their cognitive complexity, for example, their requirements for obtaining, analyzing, communicating, and applying oral, written, pictorial, and behavioral information. Consistent with this finding, intelligence predicts job performance progressively better in higher level jobs,",

    "title": "Different intelligences’ role in overcoming the differences in employee value system",
    "abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to present the findings of the research about the role of different intelligences in overcoming the differences in employee value system as a source of success. Design/methodology/approach Based on their previous research, the authors used desk and informal field research, the Dialectical Systems Theory and its Law of Requisite Holism. Findings The integration of one’s personal development with one’s individual intelligence influences human value systems. Knowledge and developing of various types of intelligence matter: it lets individuals develop faster, in the long run. The higher one’s level of intelligence is, the easier one finds it to face problems or experience. Thus, one is becoming a mature personality, who can overcome extreme alternatives to the briefed human values. This process can also receive meaningful support from the exercise of social responsibility, which is one’s responsibility for one’s impacts on society, i.e. people and nature. Success of the process depends on “personal requisite holism”. The top managers need significantly more emotional and social competences than the others. Research limitations/implications The topic is researched with qualitative analysis in desk and informal field research. Quantitative methodological approach took place in the authors’ cited previous publications. Practical implications Work distribution makes the leaders and subordinates differ in prevailing values, too. Mastering of these differences will support business success, survival of jobs included and well-being of coworkers from both groups. Application of the cognitive, emotional and spiritual intelligences might help the organization meet this need. The fourth – physical intelligence – supports ensuring the psychological well-being at work; from this, other mentioned intelligences have been developed. Mastering of these differences can also receive support from methods of creative cooperation, social responsibility and personal requisite holism; the authors have reported about these elsewhere, and only point to these in this study. Social implications The more holistic intelligences system generates a more socially responsible society. Originality/value No similar concept is offered in the available literature.",

    "abstract": "Enduring cognitive or physical performance over extended periods of time is an important ability in daily life, prototypically required in many athletic, educational, and vocational contexts. A critical requirement for maintaining performance at a high level is that individuals continuously self-regulate various affective experiences (e.g., pain or boredom), thoughts (e.g., related to distractions or quitting), and behaviors (e.g., responding to feedback or increasing effort). The ubiquitous importance of self-regulation for performance has been recognized across psychological disciplines. In this special issue, we draw upon diverse insights from these disciplines to better understand the self-regulation of human performance.",

    "title": "Understanding Developmental Coordination Disorder",
    "abstract": "Almost every adapted physical education teacher, recreation therapist, or general activity leader knows at least one individual (and more likely knows several) who has difficulty learning sport skills, whose movements appear dissimilar from peers, and/or who doesn’t do well when playing games and sports. That same individual may have difficulty with fine motor skills, have very hard to read hand writing, and may look clumsy when performing daily tasks. This individual lacks coordination. It may be that this lack of coordination is the result of a concomitant disability, inadequate opportunities to develop motor skills, or just lack of effort. However, lack of coordination may also be a result of the individual having a developmental coordination disorder.Any individual experiencing coordination problems may feel left out, inadequate, unhappy, frustrated, and embarrassed by his or her ineptness. These feelings can result in said individual’s withdrawal and/or refusal to join in and participate in physical activity. Lack of coordination can also lead to that individual being disruption in an attempt to shift attention from away from his or her lack of competence. This individual may be “labeled” lazy, slow, clumsy, stupid, or troublemaker, but no matter what the label, the individual has a problem. Lack of coordination can have lasting effects in all areas of daily life. For the physical education student with a developmental coordination disorder, frustration can lead to refusal to participate and future negative attitudes about physical activity. Lacking coordination in motor activity can also, in later life, lead to complete aversion to leading an active lifestyle. But, while general assumptions regarding who has a developmental coordination disorder, who is uncoordinated due to a disability, and who is just having transitory difficulty mastering a skill, can be made, it is important for physical education, recreation, and sport professionals to be able to distinguish the specifics of developmental coordination disorder in order to provide appropriate and timely intervention. This article explores determination of developmental coordination disorder, causes of chronic coordination problems, how a lack of coordination relates to other disabilities, and how lack of remediation can have a negative lasting effect on an active lifestyle. Most important, this article will include techniques for activity professionals to use to assist a student with developmental coordination disorder in mastering physical activity and sport skills. These techniques are equally appropriate for implementation in one-on-one situations and large classes, as well as with sports teams.Subscribe to Palaestra",

    "title": "Dyslexia: Hidden talents in the workplace",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this PhD research was to apply the principles of Positive Dyslexia to the current status of dyslexia in the workplace, with the long-term aim of creating tools to enable companies to become dyslexia friendly. Positive Dyslexia, according to Nicolson (2015), has the main aim of allowing dyslexic people to find their strengths, to craft their lives according to these strengths and thus to exploit the possibilities that these can bring to their own lives, and for the advantage of others. Four studies are presented within this thesis. Taking as starting point the “Dyslexia Decathlon”, developed by two qualitative studies from S. Agahi et al. (2014) is a set of ten skills that were found to be characteristic in those with dyslexia. These ten skills were divided into three pillars (social, cognitive and work strengths) which were all underpinned by the capacity for unconventional thinking. The social pillar includes traits such as teamwork, empathy and communication; The Mental pillar is composed by innovation/creativity, visuo-spatial and big-picture thinking and the work pillar determination and resilience, proactivity and flexible coping. The empirical work undertaken for the assessment of the dyslexia decathlon used a sampling of successful dyslexic adults and entrepreneurs. Therefore one of the aims of this thesis was to establish whether the skills identified for the dyslexia decathlon skills also can be understood to be present at an earlier age or not. The findings were followed up, in order to develop principles that would allow companies to “talent manage” their dyslexic employees.\r\n\r\nStudy 1 was undertaken with 251 non-dyslexic students and 70 dyslexic students, all from the University of Sheffield. The findings from this study revealed that dyslexic students showed significantly higher entrepreneurial intentions and traits when compared with the non-dyslexic student sample, together with a range of significant differences in parts of the Dyslexia Decathlon.\r\nStudy 2 aimed to address the limitations present in Study 1, by using a qualitative approach to understand discrepancies in the finding associated with the themes of Resilience, Big Picture Thinking, Visual Spatial and Communication skills. The findings demonstrated that although dyslexic individuals have strong qualities and traits, such as the capacity for creativity, determination, resilience, persistence, strong communication skills and empathy (Eide & Eide, 2012; West, 2009), these four variables were also found to be underdeveloped in some aspects, hence the reason for some of the discrepancies expressed in the variables of Study 1. Therefore, there is a constant need for development in order for individuals with dyslexia to excel to their highest potential and advantage. Studies 3 and 4 changed focus to dyslexia in the workplace, and were designed to investigate the current approaches taken in Brazil and in the UK. Despite the ex nsive findings of strengths in dyslexia, it appears that companies are still greatly lacking in their knowledge of Positive Dyslexia, and in particular the potential benefits of “talent managing” their dyslexic employees. Study 3 assessed companies’\r\nperspectives and attitudes towards dyslexic candidates and employees. Senior and high-level personnel from SME to multinationals were interviewed in Brazil and in the U.K. An overall lack of awareness about Positive Dyslexia was identified within the workplace, whilst a reasonable knowledge of the conventional definition of dyslexia was apparent in the sample group used from the U.K. In the Brazilian sample, both the overall awareness about dyslexia and any specific knowledge about Positive Dyslexia knowledge was non-existent. In Study 4, a quantitative research study was carried out to understand the perspective of dyslexic employees as to disclosure of their dyslexia in the workplace. The major result was that of the identification of a positive significant relationship between a company’s senior executive’s disclosure of dyslexia and the acceptability from younger dyslexic individuals to follow suit. In summary, all of the studies show clear implications for the dyslexic employee’s lifetime in a company, from appointment\r\nto talent management.",

    "abstract": "Executive functioning (EF) is a cognitive capacity that is difficult to define succinctly. Most explanations of EF reflect some degree of self-regulation as applied to cognition, emotion, behavior, adaptive functioning, and even moral reasoning and choice. In line with this, multiple models have been proposed to account for and explain the range of capacities and acts that represent EF, although the predominant models are adult-centric, and as a result, less applicable to thinking about EF developmentally. It is difficult to ignore the fact that nearly every neuropsychological evaluation in the clinical setting reveals and then attempts to address some aspect of executive dysfunction (EdF). EF deficits have a significant impact in multiple domains of a person's life and the lives of others around them, including parents, teachers, siblings, and peers. The pervasive and at times quite impairing nature of EdF calls for attention and emphasis from researchers and clinicians alike.",

    "title": "What can performance tell us about learning? Explicating a troubled concept",
    "abstract": "The notion of “performance7rdquo; has a central place in the contemporary discourse of learning and competence. The notion is used to translate abstract ideas and ideals of lifelong learning, organizational learning, learning society, etc., into practical measures. Changes in performance provide the identifiable measures that learning has taken place, evidence of enhanced competency/capability. Different versions of the learning and competency/capability agenda may place different emphases upon the extent to which such performance changes may be predetermined or are essentially emergent, but the assumption remains that performance provides the basis for attribution that learning has (or has not) taken place. This article takes issue with the conventional notion of “performance” as unequivocally observable. Drawing upon traditional philosophical distinctions between behaviour and action, and interpretative, constructionist, situational, and relational traditions within the social sciences, the nature of performance is subjected to theoretical analysis. It is argued that performance cannot be taken as transparent evidence of learning. Rather the attribution of performance is itself the outcome of situated acts of interpretation, essentially contestable and negotiated, subject to reinterpretation and renegotiation. The key social processes by which such interpretation is accomplished will be shown to implicate issues of identity (and identity formation) and social practice (and its discursive production). The potential fruitfulness of the identity-practice model will be illustrated by applying it to the issue of graduate “employability”, in order to address problems with the conventional “skills” approach.",

    "title": "Defying some difficulties of the assessment of several generic competences",
    "abstract": "A reference to concepts, procedures and attitudes and also to acquisition of capacities was frequent when\r\npeople were interchanging opinions about the aspects that could be evaluated in a university-level student.\r\nNow, we speak in terms of competences: there are specific competences, generic competences,. Just\r\ntrying to speak about them is a hard job; to obtain competences will represent an enormous challenge. It’s\r\nimportant to mention the extensive difficulty to find a common definition of the word competence. One\r\nof the many meanings is: the knowledge needed to do something, the knowledge needed to do something\r\nwith people, the knowledge needed to do something with criteria, the knowledge of when and why is\r\nnecessary to do something. Common elements to the numerous definitions are the references to: a set of\r\nconceptual knowledge, the procedures and the attitudes, feasibility in its learning with recurrent training,\r\nan explanation on its attainment in the action, its use in an efficient work and a necessary context.\r\nSome of the reasons used for the work by the competences in the educative sphere are the overcoming of\r\nthe design based on content, the integration of diverse intelligences, the advance towards a unification of\r\nthe areas of the knowledge, the true connection with a final applicability of the education in the work. A\r\nformation in competences demands several experiences that integrate knowledge and the practical design\r\nto apply these experiences – including several (and/or many) of them -, selecting and preparing the\r\ndiverse scenes that promote them. One of the objectives of the hands-on session is to explain and to\r\ndiscuss about this kind of experiences, practical designs and stages.\r\nEven with all their limitations, the conventional tools have been useful for an evaluation of the degree of\r\nassimilation of the concepts and the capacities; nevertheless, the task is much more arduous - and with\r\nless explicit experience transmissible and transmitted - when a person moves in the reach of the\r\nevaluation in values and attitudes, and of the evaluation of the competitions located within a profile. In\r\norder to evaluate competences, the educational team defines evidences. This task must be done in team\r\nfor many reasons. For example, the fact that many competences transfer the borders of the concrete\r\nterritory in which an individual professor moves. The mentioned evidences will have to be pertinent,\r\nexcellent, adapted and realistic.\r\nOften, to elaborate a scheme of the knowledge associated to each competence will identify diverse\r\npossibilities to demonstrate the possession of this competence through its development in a practical\r\nframe. Nevertheless, some competences (or some groups of competences) can be resisted to the previous\r\npractice. Perhaps it would be possible to lodge here the ethical behaviour, the capacity to learn, the\r\nresponsibility, the team work, the creative and enterprising capacity, the multiple attention to\r\nsustainability and the subjects around the communicative capacity. Also the evidences for this sort of\r\ncompetences are targeted issues in the debates.\r\nWithin the previous frame, the authors of this contribution have made tasks destined to the specification\r\nof several elements, in the work of the CAU-AIDA group of the professors of several universities ,\r\nwithin the project #SEJ2007-65786 “Evaluation of competences of the university students in the face of\r\nthe challenge of the EEES: description of the current scenario, analysis of good practices and proposals of\r\ntransfer to different environments” and can offer some results of their task that shows there are options to\r\napproach some assessments about many generic competences. The planned procedure is to expose briefly\r\nsome experiences and the referred evidences, devoted to the assessment that can be transferred,\r\nconcerning each of the above mentioned generic competences.",

    "abstract": "Mental health is an integral part of the overall health of an individual. It is not just the nonexistence of any mental disorder but also includes one's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects our lives to a great extent by having an impact on the way we feel, act, and perceive. It is vital to pay attention to mental health as is the case with maintaining physical health to work constructively and to realize one's potential. Apart from depression, stress, and anxiety, there are several other types of mental disorders prevailing like Personality disorders, Psychotic disorders, eating disorders, and many more. Anyone can become a victim of a mental issue irrespective of gender, age, profession, and standard of living. Such issues must be predicted in advance to accelerate the process of diagnosing the problem so as to enhance the quality of life of the patient. Many such predictive models have been implemented with the help of algorithms associated with modern domains such as machine learning, deep learning, image processing, voice detection, and many more. This study aims at providing a comparative study of the works that have already been done in this domain and to find the best algorithm to predict mental illness thereby taking appropriate actions to combat such issues.",

Component cognitive abilities that constitute what collectively is known as executive function include the following: inhibition, that is, the ability to ignore distraction and stay focused, and to resist making one response and instead make another; working memory, that is, the ability to hold information in mind and manipulate it; cognitive flexibility, that is, the ability to switch perspectives flexibly, focus of attention, or response mappings. These abilities are crucial to all forms of cognitive performance. The ability to inhibit attention to distractors makes possible selective and sustained attention.",

    "title": "Beyond Risk and Protective Factors: An Adaptation-Based Approach to Resilience",
    "abstract": "How does repeated or chronic childhood adversity shape social and cognitive abilities? According to the prevailing deficit model, children from high-stress backgrounds are at risk for impairments in learning and behavior, and the intervention goal is to prevent, reduce, or repair the damage. Missing from this deficit approach is an attempt to leverage the unique strengths and abilities that develop in response to high-stress environments. Evolutionary-developmental models emphasize the coherent, functional changes that occur in response to stress over the life course. Research in birds, rodents, and humans suggests that developmental exposures to stress can improve forms of attention, perception, learning, memory, and problem solving that are ecologically relevant in harsh-unpredictable environments (as per the specialization hypothesis). Many of these skills and abilities, moreover, are primarily manifest in currently stressful contexts where they would provide the greatest fitness-relevant advantages (as per the sensitization hypothesis). This perspective supports an alternative adaptation-based approach to resilience that converges on a central question: \"What are the attention, learning, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making strategies that are enhanced through exposures to childhood adversity?\" At an applied level, this approach focuses on how we can work with, rather than against, these strengths to promote success in education, employment, and civic life.",

    "title": "Abductive Reasoning: A Design Thinking Experiment",
    "abstract": "Abstract Design thinking fundamentally relies on abductive reasoning. Diverse thinking types such as divergent thinking, systems thinking, and empathetic thinking have been adopted in design thinking education. Yet, it is very rare to address abductive reasoning to be integrated in a design thinking course because of deductive validity and inductive strength. In practice, the quality of design thinking is judged from design outcomes in terms of creativity and innovation rather than the application of abductive reasoning in thinking that is necessary for educators to develop diverse instructional strategies for design thinking. Through a design thinking experiment where abductive reasoning was structured for groups of students to modify their chosen fairy stories by challenging identified lessons/values/beliefs, we articulated relevant strategies from case analysis. As a result, we discovered the following six strategies for abductive reasoning: questioning on socially given identity; restructuring a hierarchy of values; de‐ and re‐contextualisation; perspective‐taking; being intersubjective through body swapping; and developing imaginative empathy for compassion. The six strategies support pedagogical aspects of design thinking such as collaborative problem‐solving and analytic and empathetic engagement; and thus, design educators can use them in developing instructional strategies to facilitate abductive reasoning in design thinking.",

In making inferences, observers utilize schematically organized knowledge and tendencies to react which they have acquired, either through experiences which are common to everyone as they grow up, or as result of particular individual experiences and training. Thus some inferences and judgements are closely similar in different individuals, while others show marked individual differences. Evidence supporting this thesis is given in examples drawn from everyday life and from experimental investigations.",

    "abstract": "The article presents the discourse around the search for a way the teachers of the educational institutions have to overcome a syndrome of the professional burnout (hereinafter -SPB).Since SPB is determined by a set of cognitive, affective and behavioral factors that are manifested in the self-sphere, the problem of resourcefulness in resistance to SPB as a threat to optimal functioning is still actual considering the following: 1) possible level of burnout in the form of stress, resistance and exhaustion; 2) the problem of self-regulation of individual behavior; 3) manifestations of certain signs of disorders of the internal structure of the individual, such as \"emotional exhaustion\", \"depersonalization\", \"reduction of professional achievements\"; 4) low level of individual desire for self-development and low self-esteem of the individual of the qualities that promote self-development; 5) the problem of perfectionism; 6) the problem with the motivation of professional activity; 7) lack of meaningful life orientations, etc.In identifying the eco-approach as a means of gaining resources to the resistance of the SPB, it is advisable to analyze various approaches to the issue and determine the principles of the existing concepts for understanding: 1) the phenomenon of \"burnout\" as a manifestation of professional activity on the individual; 2) the phenomenon of qualitative-oriented management, emphasizing the paradigm of \"system within system\"; 3) the phenomenon of uncertainty in psychology; 4) the phenomenon of \"integral personal characteristics\".The role of such constructs as \"nature of nature\", \"method of method\", \"principle of principle\", \"paradigm of paradigm\" and \"the resulted result\" as the narratives in the search for resourceful potential by a person is traced.So, in case of understanding (cognition) by the individual the nature of some complexity in all its paradoxes and contradictions, we can hope for his / her ability to overcome it in the multifactorial nature of certain manifestations and fluctuations.Lean-thinking will hinder existing obstacles being in this way.The article is focused on the readiness of the teacher to find resourceful and overcome non-resourceful strategies to achieve the goal, to advance in personal and professional development, to harmonize relations with others.Thus, in accordance with the above, the optimization of a sole purposeful functional system of the personalityis the criterion that characterizes the function of individual development, i.e. his / her adaptation to the special conditions of his / her activities, taking into account the personal factors.The urgency of the problem lies in solving the dilemma: the mismatch of the adaptive properties of the organism and the actual human experience, i.e. the possibility of acquiring certain skills, abilities, readiness (willingness).",

    "title": "Creativity, Automaticity, Irrationality, Fortuity, Fantasy, and Other Contingencies: An Eightfold Response Typology",
    "abstract": "A 4-decade long research program that had started out focusing on creative genius unexpectedly produced a general response typology potentially applicable to the average person on the street. In particular, attempts to define both creativity and noncreativity resulted in an eightfold typology of everyday human thought and behavior. Given any situation that may evoke a response, the alternative outcomes can be distinguished according to their initial probability, actual utility, and the person's prior knowledge of that utility. These 3 parameters then yield 8 major types of outcomes: (a) routine, reproductive, or habitual responses (based on acquired life and work expertise); (b) fortuitous responses (such as uninformed response biases); (c) irrational perseveration (or failing to learn from past mistakes); (d) problem finding (such as violations of expert expectations); (e) irrational suppression (refusing to do what's good for you); (f) creative or productive thoughts and behaviors (original, useful, and surprising responses); (g) rational suppression (such as those due to previous response extinction); and (h) mind wandering and behavioral exploration (such as fantasy, tinkering, and play). These distinct responses exhibit important interrelationships. For example, although habitual responses are antithetical to creative thought and behavior, creativity is fostered by problem finding, rational suppression, and mind wandering or behavioral exploration. Moreover, because the 3 parameters can assume continuous values between 0 and 1 inclusively, the typology allows for more finely differentiated thoughts and behaviors, including “satisficing” decisions that fall short of utility optimization as well as tentative hunches residing between absolute ignorance and certain knowledge.",

Contrasted with crystallized intelligence , or an individual's culturally acquired knowledge, fluid intelligence is a broad and overarching concept that involves multiple cognitive skills such as inductive reasoning, comparing relations, and abstracting, and is correlated with working memory and cognitive control. Tests intended to assess fluid reasoning, such as progressive matrices or figure classification, are often visual–spatial. Conceptual models of fluid intelligence are reviewed, together with alternative views. Prominent empirical findings relating to cognitive changes over the lifespan, historical changes in test performance, and the neural bases of fluid intelligence are considered, as well as individual and developmental differences that may contribute to and maintain flexibly adaptive “on‐the‐spot” thinking and reasoning capacity.",

    "abstract": "Mindfulness is being introduced into most every major sector of society, including education, medicine, business, government, and the military. An important distinction regarding control over mind-wandering that is often made in mindfulness training programs is attempting to suppress thoughts versus allowing thoughts to pass away without elaborating, judging, or analyzing them. For instance, using standardized measures of academic performance, some research teams have observed improvements after a brief mindfulness intervention. Many published mindfulness interventions do already include extensive didactic instruction of various mindsets related to mindfulness. However, mindfulness training may also influence mind-wandering and academic achievement indirectly by reducing levels of negative affect or by changing students' mindsets about their ability to control their attention. Strategies for reducing mind-wandering have immense practical significance given the robust relationship between mind-wandering and impaired task performance. Achieving stable improvements in mind-wandering may therefore require both an adaptive mindset as well as practices that enhance attentional control.",

Pero más allá de los ejemplos señalados, no encontramos desarrollos sistemáticos conductuales de los criterios para identificar como autónomo a un aprendizaje y distinguirlo de otro no autónomo. El presente trabajo pretende delimitar dicha noción, haciéndolo desde el marco teórico y epistemológico conductual. Asumiendo que los significados se establecen como uso, se analiza la práctica usual del término aprendizaje autónomo, derivando de ella diversos aspectos relevantes.

This chapter presents embodied practices that underscore how disorientation productively shifts our perspective from a focus on visibility and stability to a sensibility energized by proprioception and instability. In addition, it traces the implications of shifting orientations, getting lost, embracing the unforeseen, and moving in between states of knowing and unknowing. The practice of dwelling in the unforeseen requires a tolerance for ambiguity and conjures a state of being that is at once open to the world around us and grounded in our own sensory experience. Certain physical practices can train for a psychic tolerance for chaos, confusion, being off-balance or feeling uncomfortable—paving the way to respond to disorientation with curiosity rather than reacting with fear.",

    "abstract": "The concepts of «personal maturity» and «professional maturity» are often used in the literature, which are not identical since they describe different psychological realities. Personal maturity is defined by the authors as a key new formation of age, which radically changes the previous social situation of development, as a psychological new formation. That is, professional maturity may be a relatively autonomous entity that does not necessarily correlate with personal growth. Personal maturity is characterized by a process of internal personal transformation, the source of which is the individual's need for self-actualization and sense of identity. Autonomy is determined as the most important feature. Personal maturity within the functional approach framework is considered as a self-regulatory system, where the main function is the transformation (regulation) of the ontogenetic development process into a purposeful, systemic, personality-given process that acquires individual features in the means, conditions and purposes of this development. It is known that the effectiveness of socio-pedagogical activities largely depends on the level of training, theoretical knowledge and practical skills of the teacher, one’s skills and abilities to establish contact with the student. In our opinion, the best indicator of the quality of socio-pedagogical training, primarily, is the effective implementation of future professional activities. We believe that the criterion for ensuring the effective performance of professional duties is a high level of future teacher’s socio-professional maturity development. Social maturity consists of individual components like any complex, integral phenomenon. Certain states of personality that accompany one’s activities in various spheres of public life act as such components. There are many approaches in the scientific literature to building the structure of social maturity and to identifying the components that are of most importance and play the role of «supporting element» of the «core» of social maturity.",

    "title": "Evidence-based training of wisdom in business and management: Use of scientific insights about malleability of practical wisdom for rigorous interventions",
    "abstract": "Cultivation of practical wisdom in business depends on understanding of malleability of wisdom-related characteristics. Recent experimental evidence suggests dramatic malleability in core features of wisdom, which has implications for assessment as well as external and personal training. The present chapter aims to provide a systematic review of evidence concerning the malleability of critical features of practical wisdom – intellectual humility, consideration of change, as well as perspective-taking and integration. A particular focus is devoted to the role of situational factors in inhibiting or promoting practical wisdom. Results indicate that social contexts (e.g., being together with friends/work-colleagues) promote more practical wisdom than non-social situations, self-focused contexts inhibit practical wisdom, and contexts promoting ego-decentered mindsets (e.g., self-distancing) sustain practical wisdom in self-focused situations. Within-person (state) differences in wisdom across situations are at least as large if not larger than between-person (trait) differences. Insights about the malleability of practical wisdom also resulted in a novel state-sensitive approach to measure practical wisdom across both state and trait-level, allowing for ecological measurement of meta-cognitive processes in a cost-efficient and reliable fashion. The chapter concludes with speculation about implications for evidence-based intervention programs to foster practical wisdom in people’s lives.",

The mentally retarded, influenced by the same set of learning variables that influence and control much of the behavior of all humans, can experience a wide range of learning difficulties and deficits. The treatment or behavior change approach is an educational one. If a person is experiencing difficulty, he is presenting symptoms of a poor educational experience. The retarded may exhibit too much behavior in terms of general environmental requirements. Excessive behavior patterns are quite likely to be labeled as deviant or pathological by the social environment. Because of the apparent visibility of such behaviors, it is easy to notice conflict with or deviation from standards of conduct.",

The definition of goal priming is different from priming due to other psychological representations. Unconscious goal priming is able to induce motivational behavior and the effect of priming cue does not fade over time. The independent variables of goal priming are related to the subject's psychological states and the influence from others. The dependent variables of goal priming are related to the performances of tasks and the social relationships. The perception-behavior model, behavior choice model, evaluation preparing model and affect factors model explain the psychological mechanism of goal priming from the perspectives of unconscious and goal.

Independence is a complex process, demanding not only the example but also own and very often verified experiences.

Independence allows then for asking questions concerning oneself, own place among others, and these always stay in a close bond to own identity.

In recent years, a different view has gained ground. Aging, it is argued, should be treated not simply as a biological process but as a lived experience shaped by mind, body, and community. The Psycho-Nutritional Intervention Approach (PNIA) is an attempt to respond to this broader challenge. It draws together strands that have usually been kept separate: psychological counseling, a largely plant-based diet informed by sattvic principles, yoga and controlled breathing practices, mindfulness meditation, and creative activities such as music and cognitively stimulating games. None of these methods is new; each has its own literature. What distinguishes PNIA is the deliberate attempt to bind them into a single, practical framework that can be applied in community and clinical settings. This paper considers how PNIA may influence daily functioning, emotional resilience, and cognitive stability in older adults. To capture these effects, well-established geriatric tools are proposed, including the Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living, the Lawton–Brody scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale, the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Early pilot programs and wellness camps, though modest in scale and not without their limitations, suggest encouraging results. Participants frequently reported greater ease in self-care, brighter mood, and a renewed sense of social connection. Taken together, these observations indicate that PNIA may offer more than symptom relief. By combining modern gerontological insights with traditional Eastern practices, it opens the possibility of viewing old age not simply as decline but as a stage in which resilience, meaning, and new forms of growth can still be cultivated.",

We propose that a broader vision of well-being – or optimal functioning – should be the ultimate criterion. This conceptualization does not preclude performance but rather encompasses performance while including many other important aspects excluded from a narrow and limiting performance perspective. We present and build on historical and current perspectives that point toward the centrality of well-being (e.g., Psychology of Working, Critical Studies, Humanitarian Work Psychology, Occupational Health Psychology, and Positive Organizational Scholarship). The complexification of the ultimate criterion for well-being includes multiple perspectives, domains, and levels that have synergies and tensions. We believe this complexity adds increased rigor and realism that advances both our science and practice. A focus on well-being is also aligned with the broader field of psychology and societal concerns",

    "abstract": "Social skills training is a collection of various techniques which includes instructions, modeling, behavior rehearsal, corrective feedback, social reinforcement, and selected cognitive restructuring which can be effectively utilized to modify the social behavior of person with a broad range of interpersonal difficulties. Persons recovering from long term mental disorders tend to lose social skills though they may have residual skills which the mental health professionals need to identify and work upon. However, application of social skills training and approaches to the treatment of major psychiatric disorders is a challenge to the professionals working in the field of mental health. The present chapter focuses on the vital areas where mental health professionals need to focus with regard to building social skills while working with the persons recovering from mental disorders. Elucidating the very nature of the technique, it seeks to present social skills training as an essential and viable alternative to pharmacological treatment for treatment of persons with long term psychiatric illnesses. Person with social skill deficits, like an inability to express thoughts, feelings and emotions, arising either as part of the illness, or due to restriction of learning new opportunities to acquire, the chapter highlights how the technique can help the persons in treatment gain new social skills. Through case illustrations that entail the adoption of social skills as a technique, it elaborates the usage of the technique in holistic attempts to rehabilitate the client back into the mainstream of society.",

Mental enhancement not only facilitates peak performance, but it also empowers us to go anywhere and do anything with authority and conviction. Cognitively enabled employees have the necessary skills, knowledge, and ability to do their jobs. Unfortunately, few of us realize brain building is possible, or how to begin. Technically speaking, brain building is called cognitive skill development and has been in the psychology domain since the early 1960s. J. P. Guilford, eminent professor at University of Southern California, and a President of American Psychological Association, designed the Structure of Intellect, winning several prestigious awards for it. This intellectual model consisted of a cube of 126 different mental abilities. See J. P. Guilford & R. Hoepfner, 1971, The Analyses of Intelligence New York: McGraw Hill; R. J. Sternberg, 1991, Competence Considered, and 1992, Intellectual development, both Cambridge, MA: Yale University Press. Historically, cognitive skill improvement was isolated within progressive coastal school districts and Psychologists' private practices. Cognitive skill improvement was used successfully as a treatment in these arenas for learning and even psychological problems. Unfortunately, its use as a training tool was ignored, in spite of obvious work place implications. Most of us do not like to admit we have trouble processing information. We may feel insulted, and even become defensive at the very thought. However, we do not have to feel self-conscious about this type of self-improvement. Each of us is a unique individual, and information processing can vary 2 BEST COPY AWMLABLE across a considerable range from person to person. However, where possible, each of us should seek to optimize our mental abilities. Think of your mind as a valuable core aspect of your ability to be productive. Consider shaping it up, as you would fine-tune the engine of a sports car. Many, becoming aware that a way to speed up information processing exists, become enthusiastic about personal advancement and heightened work efficiency. It all boils down to getting more work done in less time, with less stress and effort. With the technical demands of the new century, and the elimination of training jobs because of new technologies, we should strengthen our brains and develop our own intellectual capital bank. Beginning: Understanding Our Brain Foundation. Unless our mental profiles are empirically tested, we can only guess what our individual strengths and weaknesses are. Psychologists and learning specialists are qualified to test and re-train cognitive skills on an individualized basis. However, formal testing evaluations are expensive and time consuming, so this becomes impossible for most of us. As a learning disability specialist, I tested and trained learning problems for years. Assessing specific learning difficulties, severe cases ADD, dyslexia, and ADHD, I wondered what the typical mental profile would be, and how it related to the workplace. It soon became evident. My clients from the general population soon included a wide array of people, from students, professionals, executives, engineers, the average employee, to athletes. I conducted many field tests with corporations and over a thousand students, as they are intact seated learning groups and do not travel on business missing training. I evaluated performance improvement change with nationally standardized cognitive skill measures and achievement tests. Although it is known we all have different learning style profiles, and there are more than fifty, I made some interesting discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Problem statement. The article presents the results of a theoretical study of the problem of emotional competence. It is shown that emotional competence is an important aspect of professional success. The formation and development of emotional competence of specialists allows them to achieve success in the professional sphere, and also allows to avoid psycho-emotional disorders and preserve mental ealth. Concepts of competence mainly focus on the mental processes that underlie the activity, on the knowledge that arises as a result of these processes and its organization, on conscious practice, or on talent or innate abilities. The processes that distinguish an expert from a novice include the following processes: planning, tracking, evaluation of problem solving, decision making. Experts and novices provide information differently; the former develop more complex strategies and activity monitoring than the latter. The success of professional activity also depends on personal qualities: a stable and positive system of relations with one's own inner and surrounding world, as well as the level of formation and development of emotional intelligence; specialists who better understand and manage their own emotions, adapt more easily to stressful and crisis conditions, are more proactive and responsible. The purpose of the article is to study the problem of emotional competence as the basis of professional success. Results of the research. Based on the above, we conclude that emotional competence can be considered as a psychological phenomenon that reflects the emotional maturity of an individual and summarizes the emotional, intellectual and regulatory components of the psyche involved in the process of achieving professional and personal goals. Emotional competence has such a significant impact on many aspects of a person's professional life and professional activities. The study of this problem helps to reveal the key mechanisms underlying professional success. The results of such studies can be used to develop education and training programs aimed at improving the emotional competence of employees, as well as to form a better understanding of how important it is to combine professional knowledge with the skills of effective interpersonal communication and interaction to achieve professional success.",

The framework presented, called the \"multiple systems model of reading\", views development as contingent cycles of construction and reconstruction that developmental resources at various levels of functioning (genetic, neural, psychological, behavioral, and environmental) contribute to. The model makes two key assumptions: (a) reading abilities are continuously distributed, and (b) the developmental process has distributed control; every observed outcome is jointly determined by multiple factors, including the developing organism itself. Ramifications of these assumptions for both research and educational practice are discussed. Educational practice is well served by respecting the complex, and sometimes idiosyncratic, nature of the developing organism, and by not allocating causal responsibility, or all the remedial efforts, of possible reading problems to any single cause.",

    "title": "Toward the study of the relationship between psychological defenses and psychosocial stress factors in modern foreign science",
    "abstract": "The phenomenon of psychological defenses is considered from the standpoint of various approaches (cognitive, psychodynamic, behavioral, etc.), to understanding this phenomenon. The novelty in the research of foreign authors of the first quarter of the 21st century is traced. Empirical studies of psychological defenses within the framework of the theory of “stress vaccination”, “minority stress” in connection with “distorted perception”, social control and psychological well-being are presented. The impact of social factors (stress, depression, etc.) on the development of immature psychological defenses in a person, which reduce the level of psychological well-being, the ability to cope with mental conditions and disorders, and the level of self-esteem, is relevant. In cases of gender discrimination, alienation (avoidance) is more often chosen, while stigmatization on some other grounds leads to self-condemnation, self-doubt, and depression. Separate studies are devoted to the negative consequences of the use of immature and neurotic psychological defenses, as a result of which positive results are devalued, and the task is perceived subjectively as more difficult, while the use of mature protective mechanisms increases the mental stability of the individual. A number of modern foreign studies are devoted to understanding psychological defenses as factors of recovery or degradation, for example, the interpretation of the mechanisms underlying depression as protective (“smoke detector”), and sleepwalking and night terrors as a causes of “failure” of more mature and adaptive psychological defenses. The latest research on the trigger of time and place in its relationship with the cognitive processes of a person experiencing a psychotic episode can provide a more favorable outcome on the path of recovery. The purpose of this work was to study the current directions of research on the problem of psychological protection in foreign publications of the late 20th — first quarter of the 21st century. The research methods were the analysis and structured presentation of literary sources of foreign authors on the problem of the phenomenon of psychological defenses in modern foreign science.",

    "title": "Reasoning Skills in Individuals with Mathematics Difficulties",
    "abstract": "Reasoning and mathematics skills are typically studied in separate literatures. Yet, these abilities are related at multiple levels. For example, understanding new concepts, selecting an appropriate strategy to solve a mathematics problem, or learning from feedback involves reasoning. There is also emerging evidence that the basic representations that underlie certain forms of reasoning and mathematics skills (e.g., ordering ability, creating a \"mental line\" representation, making comparisons) are overlapping. The main focus of this chapter is on how reasoning skills are affected by dyscalculia/mathematics difficulties, and how reasoning skills relate to mathematics performance. To address these questions, I first consider the cognitive profiles of individuals with dyscalculia. Dyscalculia is associated with a range of cognitive deficits (in working memory, long-term memory for order, spatial attention, etc.) that are not specific to the domain of numbers. It is essential to understand how cognitive abilities and resources might be affected in dyscalculia, as reasoning skills rely heavily on cognitive resources. I also give an overview of the various ways in which reasoning and mathematics abilities are related, and also consider the evidence regarding the extent to which reasoning abilities in individuals with mathematics difficulties are affected. These questions are important both from a theoretical and practical point of view, and one aim of the chapter is to highlight and discuss these implications. I also outline some important future directions for this line of work.",

    "abstract": "The concept of intelligence is usually conceived of and operationalized in terms of cognitive capacities—relatively fixed information processing operations that determine the efficiency with which preestablished goals are achieved. Intelligence, as operationalized in standardized assessment instruments, has not included the measurement of dispositions toward rational thought and behavior (i.e., the thought processes that fix beliefs proportionately to evidence and that maintain consistency among beliefs). This contrasts with the vernacular use of the term intelligence, which does subsume dispositions toward rationality. It is argued that educational researchers and social scientists should begin to consider the consequences of the discrepancy between scientific/professional and vernacular concepts of intelligence. In order to provoke thought about the discrepancy and the effects that it has on educational practice and social policy, it is proposed that the field consider the implications of a new psychological concept, dysrationalia: the inability to think and behave rationally despite adequate intelligence.",

    "abstract": "In consequence of the scientific literature analysis is defined that: Autoaggression is an activity, aimed consciously or unconsciously at inflicting self-injuries either physical or mental. An autoaggressive behaviour is expressed in the form of prompt planning and preparation to autoaggressive activity; in choosing consciously lethal ways of its realization; in long-term unaffective pre-suicidal period. Autoaggression manifests in self-accusation, self-abasement, inflicting injuries yourself with different stage of severity even coming up to suicide, and in self-harm — ranging in severity and including suicide, and in self-destructive behaviour (drinking, alcoholism, drug addiction, a choice of adventure sports, unsafe professions, provocative behaviour). In consequence of analysis of approaches to the research of autoaggression, the classification is proposed in order to systematization of existent information concerning to the proposed question.",

Regardless of an individual's experiences in a classroom, it is obvious th:a:t he engages in some sort of mental activity during every waking moment. When his thinking is not focused on a particular subject, there is still a parade of half-formed images, memories, speculations, and anticipations passing across his consciousness. Thus, the teacher who makes thinking an objective of education without specifying the kind, or kinds, of operations he is referring to by the term \"thinking\" can be assured of reaching his objective, but he should realize that the objective was met long before it was formed, and his efforts had little to do with the achievement.",

    "abstract": "The article examines the problem of managing health potential through psychological technologies, in particular the formation of an individual’s emotional intelligence. In the modern world, a person can hardly achieve absolute health (for reasons of environmental violations, high-speed socio-psychological standards of self-realization). At the same time, the individual’s area of responsibility is the process of migration of health indicators on the “Health – Disease” continuum and its approach/removal to/from the “label/ label Health”. We are talking not only about systematic monitoring of biochemical health indicators, but also psychological facts indicating the direction of the health vector. Psychological health factors include automated negative verbalizations of attitudes, needs, motives, and values; irrational character traits and subsequent psycho-emotional states. Awareness and control of negative psycho-emotional states constitute the essence of the process of developing emotional intelligence.",

Academic self-concept is specific to the educational context, so a student may be engaged in some academic pursuits but not connect to others. Disidentification from an academic pursuit usually causes withdrawal of effort. Anxiety is the emotion that has received the most attention from educational psychologists and librarians, but students also experience surprise, curiosity, enyoyment, confusion, frustration, and boredom. Confusion can be beneficial to learning if it is resolved before one feels overly frustrated.",

Due to the abstract nature of cognition, assessment is widely studied, yet impossible to perfect with any psychometric instrument. Methods of cognitive assessment range from informal (self-monitoring, self-report surveys) to formal (clinical interviewing, cognitive functional analysis, and psychophysiological measures). Limitations exist in the areas of accuracy, internality, and accessibility, as well as in the reliability and validity of available cognitive-behavioral assessments. Most assessments are not equipped to adequately take cultural considerations into account. Future trends are discussed, including the use of neuroimaging and technology for improving accuracy and understanding of cognitive-behavioral testing.",

The evolution of self concept is reviewed in light of the operation of the transition experiences – cognitive flexibility, generative intelligence, personal intelligences, motivation, and purpose through the use of retrospective interviews with twenty-four elite performers in three domains (business, sports, and music) who successfully and repeatedly transitioned to higher positions within their field.",

Ademas, existen evidencias de que se trata de un factor protector ante la realizacion de las conductas de riesgo. Sin embargo, no hay acuerdo en la definicion y modelos de inteligencia emocional. Asi, es posible encontrar diferentes enfoques, que se clasifican, principalmente, en modelos mixtos o de habilidad y tambien diferentes instrumentos que apresan el constructo.\nEn esta investigacion se pretende poner a prueba el modelo de inteligencia emocional de las cuatro ramas. Para ello, se llevaran a cabo dos investigaciones: En la primera de ellas, se comprobara la relacion entre la inteligencia emocional y las variables rendimiento academico, satisfaccion con la vida, realizacion de conductas de riesgo y apoyo social percibido y, en la segunda, se verificara si la inteligencia emocional se puede incrementar a traves de programas de entrenamiento. Esta potencial mejora se va a poner a prueba con dos entrenamientos, fundamentados en dos modelos diferentes de inteligencia emocional.\nEn la medida en que una validacion cruzada de resultados ayuda a una mayor generalizacion de los hallazgos encontrados, se realizaran las dos investigaciones en dos paises de habla hispana, Espana y Mexico. En la primera investigacion, participaran estudiantes universitarios y en la segunda, en Mexico, padres de ninos que acuden a una clinica de salud mental y, en Espana, profesorado no universitario.\nEsta tesis doctoral pone en cuestion el modelo de inteligencia emocional de las cuatro ramas. Por tanto, se precisa una revision en profundidad que permita acotar la definicion, los componentes, los instrumentos y la influencia de la inteligencia emocional sobre otros constructos.",

    "title": "Fostering and Measuring Skills: Interventions that Improve Character and Cognition",
    "abstract": "This paper reviews the recent literature on measuring and boosting cognitive and noncognitive skills. The literature establishes that achievement tests do not adequately capture character skills – personality traits, goals, motivations, and preferences that are valued in the labor market, in school, and in many other domains. Their predictive power rivals that of cognitive skills. Reliable measures of character have been developed. All measures of character and cognition are measures of performance on some task. In order to reliably estimate skills from tasks, it is necessary to standardize for incentives, effort, and other skills when measuring any particular skill.Character is a skill, not a trait. At any age, character skills are stable across different tasks, but skills can change over the life cycle. Character is shaped by families, schools, and social environments. Skill development is a dynamic process, in which the early years lay the foundation for successful investment in later years.High-quality early childhood and elementary school programs improve character skills in a lasting and cost-effective way. Many of them beneficially affect later-life outcomes without improving cognition. There are fewer long-term evaluations of adolescent interventions, but workplace-based programs that teach character skills are promising. The common feature of successful interventions across all stages of the life cycle through adulthood is that they promote attachment and provide a secure base for exploration and learning for the child. Successful interventions emulate the mentoring environments offered by successful families.",

    "abstract": "Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It is an integral component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in. Mental health is a basic human right. And it is crucial to personal, community and socio-economic development. Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders. It exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next, with varying degrees of difficulty and distress and potentially very different social and clinical outcomes. Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm. People with mental health conditions are more likely to experience lower levels of mental well-being, but this is not always or necessarily the case. This research paper will focus on those challenges and problems which are more serious rendering them into genuine mental health concerns. An attempt will also be made at discussing and explaining how these mental health problems can be dealt with and managed, while acquainting you with the existing forms of psycho therapy and intervention which are used.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue, as a psychophysiological state, is a normal human condition experienced as a result of mental or physical activity that consumes one's biological resources. In order to relieve its symptoms and to restore human's ability to continue work, a return to a fresh, relaxed state is required. It is usually obtained by an adequate amount of rest and/or sleep, but under the presence of some disadvantageous factors, such as too hot or too cold microclimate, high levels of noise at a workplace, work overload, psychological stress, lack of motivation, and others, e.g., family or health-related problems, this needed amount of rest simply may not fit into a normal 24-hour cycle of activity, resulting in the fatigue built-up. A fatigued worker becomes prone to performance deterioration, loss of concentration, misjudgment of his/her environmental safety, hazardous behaviors, anxiety and sleepiness. Therefore, worker's fatigue management is essential for improving productivity and quality of work, as well as for building worker's satisfaction, motivation and overall wellbeing. To supervise fatigue, appropriate tools for its measurement are required. This paper presents an overview of existing methods of fatigue measurement, including psychological (self-reports and questionnaires), physiological (i.e., changes in various body functions), and performance related (e.g., reaction time, sensory abilities) ones.",

These effects are related to personal motivations to enhance learning, recovery, or hard work on the part of others. Most jobs involve dealing with people; for teachers, managers, salespeople, and others this is the main task. Socially unskilled managers produce high levels of discontent, and consequent absenteeism and labour turnover among their subordinates. All kinds of mental patients have social behaviour problems. Schizophrenics are the worst, and are found very difficult to interact with. Assertiveness, the ability to influence or control others, has sometimes been equated with social competence. The social moves or signals of the social skills model are partly non-verbal, and perception and feedback is partly of the non-verbal communication of others. Assertiveness and rewardingness require special non-verbal styles of voice, face and posture.",

For instance, despite much commercial interest in and a potentially huge market for successful gamification products in the areas of education and health, much of the excitement is still based on speculation, and reception in parts of the academic community remains sceptical. The chapter aims to collate observations from multiple empirical studies and meta-studies and collect and highlight issues that need to be resolved or mitigated for gamification to progress. Such issues include unclear definitions, a limitation on small sets of elements employed with unclear effects, unintentional side-effects of competition, a confusing variety of operationalizations, the erosion of intrinsic motivation through extrinsic incentives, a disconnect between theoretical understandings and practical realizations, a strong focus on a behaviorist paradigm, studies' mixed, partial, and inconclusive results, a lack of attention to moderating factors, and methodological limitations.",

Cognitive abilities are hierarchically organized, which implies that general cognitive ability predicts performance on most tasks that involves active information processing. Physical abilities show a less well-defined structure; these abilities tend to be relevant to more narrowly defined tasks. Personality traits (especially the Big-Five—Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness) are most relevant to understanding interpersonal interactions. They are related to job performance, but this relationship is surprisingly weak. Interests are related to vocational choice, motivation, and satisfaction. Individual differences in core self-evaluations predict a willingness to take the initiative, to persevere, and to attempt to achieve challenging goals.",

It is possible that alerting instructors and students to these principles may lessen their occurrence.",

    "abstract": "Games play a significant part in the Physical Education curriculum. Some may argue that including young people with disabilities in games activities is challenging due to the element of competition, the level of skill required to take part and the need for teamwork. A Universal Design for Learning (UDL) approach is suggested when planning lessons from the outset. Employing UDL means that the teacher will consider all young people beforehand, rather than during or after the lesson, ensuring that any concerns are addressed in the planning stages. Cognitive focuses on the challenge of the mind, thinking skills and decision-making. Whilst psychomotor looks specifically at what the body can do. Affective focuses on the social interaction between a team and the socialisation that takes part in discussions and talks on and off the pitch. Key concepts such as outwitting an opponent will be applicable to most games.",

In most cases, the answer is closely related to the concept of â€œemotional intelligenceâ€ . Even if it is harder to measure and ascertain in comparison with accumulated experience or IQ, its force cannot be denied. Unfortunately, as a society, we continue to put more value on self-improvement, experience, intelligence and education. It would be great if among this things we an understanding of our emotions and those around us, but also to realize the major impact that emotions have on our lives every day.

In Social Cognitive Theory, self-efficacy judgments function as one proximal determinant of four classes of psychological processes: Selection Processes, Cognitive Processes, Motivational Processes, and Affective Processes. A central question in any theory of the cognitive regulation of motivation and action is the issue of causality. Progress in psychology, however, has often been impeded by measurement tools that are far from optimal. In the assessment of personal determinants of sociocognitive functioning, investigators commonly have chosen to employ omnibus tests. Self-efficacy judgments are elements of a dynamic system of self-beliefs. A wide variety of interventions, conducted in diverse psychosocial settings, have been shown to affect people's beliefs in their efficacy to handle the challenges of everyday life.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Researchers and practitioners have become increasingly aware that executive cognitive functions (ECFs) appear to choreograph abilities such as insight, planning, problem solving, and motivation into the goal-directed behavior required for daily living. Deficits in ECFs are common and result in specific behavioral and affective impairments that impact an individual’s cognition and ability to participate in rehabilitation. Irritability, mood swings, disorganization, apathy, indifference, and inattention are some of the manifestations of ECF deficits. Impaired ECFs due to head injury, stroke, disease process, or normal aging challenges both physical and cognitive rehabilitation. For effective rehabilitation treatment and discharge planning, it is essential for the practitioner to anticipate and recognize impaired ECFs in the client. In this chapter, we will discuss definitions of ECF, its anatomical correlates, the assessment of ECF, behavior associated with ECF impairment, and issues related to cognitive rehabilitation.",

    "title": "Cognition in Practice",
    "abstract": "How may we conceive of cognition in practice? What kind of thinking and reflection animate the accomplishment of action? These problems are usually settled by an intellectualist argument: to perform an action is mainly to execute decisions, to carry out plans or intentions, or to follow instructions. According to that view, cognition produces action, but it does not take place in the accomplishment of action itself Such an intellectualist view has been taken up again and developed by recent trends in cognitive science. Why focus on such a view? Because, by its systematizing of current assumptions in most of (he theories of action, it makes the conceptual framework of those theories very clear and allows one to see the inconsistencies of its underpinning. The alternative view outlined in this paper is based on an externalist and pragmatic conception of mind. It considers cognition as a social process and reintegrates it into the performance of situated actions. To do so, it grasps performance as a genuine praxis and specifies the thinking and reflection which animate it in relation to the phenomenon of 'embodied agency.'",

    "abstract": "Empathy is the ability to understand another one’s mental states in terms of emotions and thoughts. In the pubblic mind, often, this skill is directly related to the ability to act in a prosocial, or moral, way. Clinical literature shows us that some neural deficits and psychological disorders can actually cause a significant lack of empathic ability and therefore the implementation of socially maladaptive behaviours, even criminal. However, there are also some diagnostic categories characterised by failure to “put yourself in another’s shoes”, but patients don’t usually act in an antisocial way; then, not all the criminals meet the criteria for psychiatric diagnosis. So, the question is: only low levels of empathy leads to antisocial behaviours? And if so, does therapeutic interventions for empathic skill entail moral enhancement? The present work aim to answer to all those issues through a multilevel and cross-discilplinary analysis of psychology, neurosciences and philosophy literature.",

    "title": "Self-regulation involves more than metacognition: A social cognitive perspective",
    "abstract": "AbstractThe issues that Winne found troubling about student failures to self-regulate effectively were considered from a social cognitive perspective. From this viewpoint, self-regulation involves more than metacognitive knowledge and skill, it involves an underlying sense of self-efficacy and personal agency and the motivational and behavioral processes to put these self beliefs into effect. Views of self-regulated learning that do not include this core self-referential system have difficulty explaining human failures to self-regulate, especially when such efforts are known metacognitively to be helpful. To explain students' self-regulation failures as well as their successes in naturalistic settings, educational psychologists need to expand their views of self-regulation beyond metacognitive trait, ability, or stage formulations and begin treating it as a complex interactive process involving social, motivational, and behavioral components. Such a perspective reveals not only the complexity of self-regulation but also the human side of it-the role of our self-doubts, false beliefs, unfortunate self-monitoring, and strategy choice dilemmas.",

It has evolved with improvements in technology such as advanced computer systems and brain imaging systems, which have spurred the growth of neuroscience. As the number of tools for research in the field grows, the sophistication and complexity of models have grown. However, a unique characteristic of mathematical psychology is its potential role in all branches of psychology.

Social competence involves the ability to interact with and make judgements about other people. Whether someone can correctly write a cheque, for example, depends on instrumental competence; whether someone has good judgement about when and to whom cheques should be written depends on social competence. This distinction, although intuitively obvious to most clinicians, has not been fully developed either in research or practice settings, despite having a sound basis in neuroscience. A clinically useful assessment of competence should include instrumental competence and social competence, as well as adequate and systematic exploration of individual issues of context.

Perception Plays a Different Role in Different Language Games.It is through acting on and reacting to our environment, natural and social, that we acquire perceptual concepts.We acquire them in a social milieu in which we learn to recognise and speak about those things in our environment that affect and interest us.The language games that we thus learn to participate in concern relatively permanent features of our environment, shared with others (Strawson 1961).The concepts that we possess of substances, processes, events and other people are acquired through action and observation, but necessarily also through learning our native language through interaction with adults.Perceptual concepts are acquired through social intercourse, rather than through introspection and labelling.They are made manifest through our attempts to communicate and to act on the world.They grow through our participation in normative activities (Baker and Hacker 1985) in which adults play a predominant role.We also acquire psychological concepts and concepts of sensation through the same means, but our acquisition of sensation concepts depends on our prior grasp of perceptual concepts.We learn about colour, texture, solidity, viscosity etc. through 1 The distinction between judging and acting in a professional situation is made to take account of 'knowing to' examples (see Wiggins 2012 for examples).",

It involves balancing intrapersonal, interpersonal, and extrapersonal factors in the context of short- and long-term horizons. In one study of consumer choices, those rated wiser exhibited evidence of strong personal intentions, prudent deliberation, and a clear linkage from values and knowledge to action, each of which the wisdom literature features. Students in high school or in university business programs can engage with complex cases, moral dilemmas, and everyday problems in which they are tasked with applying wisdom components for deriving more constructive and uplifting solutions.",

Psychology has been described as a hub science, with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatmentof mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior, and typically work in university psychology departments or teach in other academic settings (e.g., medical schools, hospitals). Some are employed in industrial and organizational settings, or in other areas[9] such as human development and aging, sports, health, and the media, as well as in forensic investigation and other aspects of law. We will consider social factors of psychological problems in life through this paper.",

In a systematic review of work and sport-related resilience studies, 12 mental resources were commonly identified, associated with the building and maintenance of resilience, as well as occasional references to hope, focus, and self-sufficiency. The emerging concept of self-help, mindfulness as a model, the work of Seligman, mindset, goal setting, and if-then plans are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Behavior modification has been applied successfully to a wide range of problem areas with mentally retarded individuals. Programs have effectively developed behaviors related to self-care, social interaction, general deportment, work competence, language usage, and academic achievement, to mention major target areas. In spite of the successes achieved, or perhaps in light of them, several issues have become important in implementing or evaluating behavior modification programs. It is frequently assumed that if staff perform appropriately, consequences that follow their behavior will maintain the behaviors. This is probably a naive view of the natural contingencies and their power in shaping staff behavior. Unresponsiveness of clients to behavior modification programs can be attributed to other aspects of reinforcement or its delivery.",

    "abstract": "Students are motivated by the desire to satisfy their personal needs to achieve certain individual goals and aspirations. Motivation can vary according to interactions between internal factors (such as individual needs, interests, and values) and external factors. The most difficult practical problem is to understand the nature and quality of motivation in the classroom. Metaphors can help students understand and integrate information in an easier and more meaningful way. A substantial part of Social Psychology stems from the belief that social behaviors are based on people's perception of reality. Learning styles derive from four bipolar dimensions' (David, 2015, p. 204): extravert-introvert, which refers to the capacity to assimilate and analyze information through social interaction. Adolescence is marked by fluctuating levels of self-esteem and the adoption of different attitudes and styles until it stabilizes in youth and adulthood. Willpower comes into play at this stage, representing the subjective and most crucial aspect of self-regulation. Procrastination is often used as a way to cope with anxiety arising from initiating or completing tasks. The origins of the term can be traced back to the Latin word 'pregetare,' meaning to delay, hesitate, or postpone.",

Whilst this might seem to offer opportunities for psychology, their chosen method – self‐report questionnaires – is problematic. Happiness questionnaires are troubled by problems of definition, introspection, memory and insight; their population‐level summation is grossly inaccurate as a representation of everyday emotional experience; and both their reliability and their validity might be better accounted for as products of their ability to model, rather than to measure, psychological processes. Psychology therefore runs the risk of discrediting itself if it becomes too closely associated with these initiatives.",

So what determines calmness and happiness of life is mental health. Mental health is what determines a person's response to a problem, and his ability to adjust. Mental health is what determines whether people will have the excitement to live or be passive and lackluster.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Various types of errors are shown in a mentally retarded boy (CA 12:10, Tanaka‐Binet IQ 45–50) engaging in a standardized arithmetic achievement test for first‐grade pupils. The following issues on behavioral characteristics of the mentally retarded with arithmetic tasks are discussed from a special educational point of view. 1. Production of correct solutions depends heavily on self‐regulation, motivation and metacognition levels of the retarded with arithmetic tasks. Therefore, maintaing appropriate levels of these processes is a fundamental principle in encouraging the mentally retarded to do their best. 2. How the retarded deal with a task on figures depends on how the figures appear to them. It is a perceptual problem rather than an arithmetic one. 3. While the retarded can do well on a task by manipulating the objects in question in his daily life, they cannot solve the same task in an achievement test situation. They attempt to solve a task using a familiar strategy and are difficult to change the one used. They adopt a known strategy with a clue of particular word, phrase or part of story to deal with the tasks. 4. Realization of how to use the counting principles develops step by step, but understanding process of every principle on cardinal progression is one thing and that on multiple progression is another.",

Vocational services such as supported employment (SE) have helped people with severe and persistent mental illness to obtain community-based competitive jobs by finding them appropriate opportunities, often with accommodations and supportive services. SE is now regarded as an evidence- based practice. Related cognitive impairments in emotion recognition, theory of mind, attention, memory and executive function can make it even more difficult for workers with a psychiatric disorder to understand accurately what is going on between themselves and their social environment at work. Regular feedback provides workers with a psychiatric disorder continual reassurance about what they are doing right as well as what they need to improve on. Studies published in industrial and organizational psychology and management journals strongly endorse work performance evaluations and feedback to improve productivity. There is only a small literature on the use of evaluation and feedback in rehabilitation settings.",

Assessing anticipatory behaviors leads to a better understanding of child development, providing clues to the development of a child’s cognitive skills. On a theoretical level, several questions arise. Does a child who anticipates necessarily understand the situation he is in, or does he merely make a perceptive association learned through conditioning? Can it be stated with certainty that a child who does not (or cannot) anticipate does not understand? In the case of a child’s typical development, anticipation is also one means for understanding atypical development, such as autism spectrum disorder. On a practical level, whatever the underlying explanation, anticipation deficit could be one interesting screening procedure for detecting developmental disorders as early as possible.",

Nustatyta, kad viena dažniausių problemų yra mokymosi sunkumai, sąlygoti išorinių veiksnių, pvz., neracionalių mokymosi krūvių, mokymosi priemonių stokos ir pan. Nemažiau svarbūs yra ir vidiniai veiksniai, pvz., nepakankamai išlavėję studento valingas dėmesys, suvokimas, kalba ir t.t., bei asmenybės ypatumai, charakterio bruožai.

The term \"cognition\" can be defined as \"any form of information processing, mental operation, or intellectual activity, such as thinking, reasoning, remembering, imagining, or learning\". Generally speaking, cognition includes both bottom-up and top-down cognitive processes. Physical activities differ in many ways, ranging from more energetically determined activities, such as aerobic or strength exercises, to more information-oriented activities, such as coordinative or dual-task exercises.

Every behaviour that blocks pedagogical efforts is perceived as “an unwanted behaviour ”. Unwanted behaviours affect the lesson and the whole class negatively and stop us from achieving our goals. The effort, time and money spent for the educational purpose will go for nothing ultimately.These unwanted behaviours may arise from the class structure, the teacher or from the students. One of the reasons arising from the student is that of a biological reason. These are mentioned as brain damage, disease, malnutrition due to biochemicals and they have affect on unwanted behaivours. One of the unwanted behaviours is the hyperactive attitudes of the hyperactive children. Disease, nutrition, nerval, neurological condition, temper, genetic disorders, physical diabilities, variables like medication inclines to hyperactivity with some kids.

    "title": "How to Integrate Neuroethics into a Neuroscience Course – And Drive Student Engagement with Core Concepts",
    "abstract": "Students are thinking about ethical, moral, and societal implications of science-as individuals and communities- regardless of whether these topics are part of formal curricula. Ethical questions can arise from broad neuroscientific questions (What is consciousness?), emerging topics (e.g., synthetic biological intelligence), neurotechnologies (e.g., human brain organoids), and respective intersections (Could brain organoids be intelligent or conscious?). As a field of scholarship, the ethics of brain science, or 'neuroethics', can help students to situate what they are learning in the classroom within a broader socio-philosophical context that advances critical and ethical reasoning toward future neuroscience research or technologies. I will argue that neuroethics can also enhance student situational interest and cognitive engagement with core neuroscientific concepts that align with core learning objectives. Yet faculty face challenges when incorporating neuroethics topics into courses, which may include, but are not limited to i) lack of disciplinary expertise, ii) time or resource constraints within courses, or iii) the perceived lack of value in formally including ethics instructional content in courses focused on core concepts in neuroscience education. This Opinion article aims to demonstrate how these challenges can be overcome. I describe how the Value Reappraisal Model can be used as a process theory to guide integration of neuroethics into neuroscience curricula. My autoethnographic account of developing and teaching a new course provides a case study for faculty who are interested in creating curricular opportunities for students to engage with ethical issues by fostering deeper learning and appreciation of core concepts in neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "A novice designer is prone to making premature decisions. Rather than explore issues and research information and options, he may quickly jump to posing solutions and view design as a linear, step-by-step process. Instead of testing a variety of ideas, a beginning designer often becomes mesmerized by his initial ideas. An experienced designer, on the other hand, is much more likely conduct research and delay making decisions until the challenge has been fully explored [1]. She uses a variety of techniques to generate ideas, test them, and see how they inter-relate, sees design as an iterative process, has a variety of approaches, integrates feedback and reflects on the design process. She uses rational inquiry to cross-reference and integrate ideas, information, and personal experience. Such behaviour reflects beliefs about knowledge and its creation and such actions are hallmarks of the relativistic thinker [5] who can set goals, reflect on thinking, identify what is needed and understand why it is necessary. Although the individual seeks new experiences and multiple views, she also seeks to achieve",

    "title": "Psychological Mechanism of Sinibularity of Assessing Learner’s Listening Skills at Secondary Schools",
    "abstract": "The aim of this research is to define different kinds of means for testing of the understanding of a listened audio-text, such as non-verbal means, verbal ones and reproductive means. Methods of the research. There were used the following general scientific methods: the method of induction, deduction, analysis and synthesis, comparative and descriptive methods and explanatory ones. The results of the research. There were proposed the tasks for pupils at the lessons of a foreign language, updated the psychological mechanism of the cumulative feature of recognition, which allowed us quickly, almost simultaneously formulate for each person a new task and to do its co-image and recognize it in a view of that new design. It was shown that recognition itself did not become a problem for the pupil, because that problem would be determined the significance of the task itself. However, such a possibility itself in terms of tremendous perception of some task is quite questionable, but, at the same time, the pupil performs this task. This psychological mechanism is the mechanism of sinibularity. It was shown that sinibularity was a mechanism that actualized the similarity, compatibility of objects according to their individual components, details, features. It is the basis for the formation of associative chains and it is one of the factors that forms the concept. The sinibular associative chain is a mono-modal mental construction that will be created due to the identical features of different concepts of each object. The fixation of sinibular relations is based on the possibility of recognizing the object not only taking into account the pattern, but also understanding its individual details; irradiation of the significance of the object on its basic features and the peculiarities of their restructuring affects is based on some features, and the presence of form-semantic connections facilitate the connection of external features of the object with its internal qualities, properties and characteristics. Conclusions. The psychological mechanism of sinibularity provides pupils with the solution of linguistic problems and tasks at the lessons of a foreign language by updating basic four components of the philological consciousness of the person: the identification of features (or characteristics) of a certain lexical or grammatical structure; the range of variations of their significance in the paradigm of this group of linguistic units (so-called objective concept); the level of acceptability of this variation; the differentiation of this concept, etc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Distraction is frequently blamed for interfering with the ergonomic production of capital, for encouraging substandard performance. Indeed, it is frequently configured as an impediment to timekeeping, a thorn in the side of consciousness, a drag on intentional action, and a brake on decision-making. Reality, however, is complex. While distraction can interfere with timing, anxiety, memory, error, and fatigue, it can also be exploited under controlled conditions to enhance performance by helping the performer to maintain an open cognitive and physical responsiveness to the world and a pragmatic mode of engagement with the task at hand. Indeed, distraction ensures that the performer is in close contact cognitively and socially with the full phenomenological plenitude of sound, thereby contributing to performance’s transformative value as a way of accumulating social capital in everyday life.",

    "abstract": "Cuando las personas se enfrentan a situaciones incontrolables de forma repetida y constante, se puede producir un fenomeno psicologico llamado indefension o desesperanza aprendida , lo que provoca que se dejen de esforzarse por cambiar la situacion y puede tener consecuencias incluso en la salud fisica de los individuos. En terminos individuales, esta desesperanza se puede traducir en depresion y en disminucion de la capacidad cognitiva; y en terminos sociales, en pasividad social y reforzamiento del estatus establecido. La forma de enfrentarse a situaciones dificiles e incontrolables dependera de que tan preparada se sienta la persona para hacerlo, es decir, que tan autoeficaz sea. Las investigaciones sobre autoeficacia muestran que el lograr una meta de forma exitosa depende en gran medida de que tan capaz se sienta uno mismo para lograrlo y no tanto en funcion de las verdaderas capacidades que tenga, ya que mientras mas capaz se sienta, hara mayores esfuerzos e invertira mas tiempo, lo que lo llevara a terminar la tarea exitosamente. El presente articulo, explica la relacion que existe entre la desesperanza aprendida y la autoeficacia, a traves de las investigaciones que se han realizado en el tema e intenta demostrar la importancia de estas variables en la vida cotidiana.",

    "title": "THE ROLE OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION IN THE WELL-BEING AND SCHOOL PERFORMANCE OF PUPILS",
    "abstract": "Abstract. The ever-changing ideals of modern society often tend to set too bold goals based on theoretical knowledge that can lead to great results. All these can have negative influences on mental health, characterized by a high degree of stress, exaggerated emotional reactions, reduced cognitive activity, inappropriate behaviors in the educational and social environment. Under these conditions, the practice of physical activities can be the optimal alternative for primary school pupils in order to eliminate the mental tension accumulated during the theoretical classes held in the classroom. We can say that through these activities pupils can develop their ability to adapt to various conditions, thus being able to control the emotions that appear as a consequence of the harmful influences of a civilization characterized by nervous exhaustion. Physical activity, practiced in different forms can put condition on the multidimensional development of the human being, because physical exercise develops and trains. The practice of motor activities on medium and long term, has a esential role in maintaining an optimal state of health, in promoting the sets of values, behavioral, social and personal attitudes. The purpose of this research is to find out through a questionnaire, what are the options for pupils in primary education. The questionnaire will highlight issues regarding the way of conducting the physical education class and whether it manages to increase the level of satisfaction, generating a state of relaxation and good mood.",

    "title": "Optimizing Cognitive Load in Instructional Simulations and Games",
    "abstract": "Instructional simulation and games are usually used as substitutes for actual equipment, processes, real-life problems, and social situations. They allow observing outcomes of different learner actions and steps without involving actual hardware and people. They also provide environments for practicing important skills in an efficient (in terms of cost and time) way. From a cognitive load perspective, using actual equipment or human actors may not necessarily lead to the acquisition of expected knowledge and skills. High cognitive load involved in operating the equipment itself, performing required procedures, interacting with other people, especially when allowed time is constrained, may inhibit learning. In such high load situations, limited cognitive resources would be left for actual learning. Instructional simulations and games allow modeling such processes without time limitations and other cognitive constrains. Instructional simulations may also allow representing abstract knowledge structures and processes that are difficult to observe in real conditions. They may enhance the development of abstract thinking and problemsolving skills by offering environments for exploring and testing hypotheses. Many available instructional simulations and games represent mostly exploratory learning environments with limited guidance for learners. From a cognitive load perspective, any random exploratory or search procedures may impose excessive levels of working memory load thus interfering with meaningful learning (see Chapter II for more details about basic principles of cognitive load theory). Therefore, optimizing levels of instructional guidance represents the most important means of managing cognitive load and enhancing learning outcomes in such environments. This chapter starts with examining the role of simulations as instructional technology tools and describes means of enhancing instructional effectiveness of simulations and games.

Emotional intelligence tests are published in scientific and popular literature but it is not always obvious whether they measure namely intelligence or, however, a definite set of personality traits. The authors have made an attempt to create a measure for diagnostics of emotional intelligence as an ability to solve divergent and specific tasks which are concerned with emotions. As a result of several stages of experts' evaluation a set of questions has been formed which were approved in a pilot study which revealed the existence of gender specificity and no professional specificity of emotional intelligence. Two groups of schoolchildren were compared with respect to the mentioned indices: the first of which studied according to a profound curriculum in some subjects and the other one studied according to the general curriculum. The differences between the two groups were obtained in respect to all of the mentioned phenomena. Part of them is evidence to a better sociopsychological adaptation of schoolchildren from specialized classes whereas the other differences stand for a higher level of adaptation of children with special educational needs who study in usual classes. The obtained results allow formulating practical recommendations on how to increase the level of socio",

    "abstract": "The rapid pace of everyday life, as well as the life filled with stressful situations, everyday obligations, challenges and expectations, leads to a disturbance of tranquility, stability, comfortableness in people and in the most difficult case, disturbance of their state of health in different types. In the face of such a situation, social services emerge to help in the most productive way. Starting from the fact that human behavior is truly complex, social work is broad and uses numerous practice theories at different levels. Theory, in essence, refers to interconnected and systemically related groups of concepts and statements, which are organized in order to clarify relations on certain aspects. Social work may not have developed its own theory, but it successfully uses theories from other scientific disciplines. In order to have success in the realization of the social activities, it is necessary to have a ratio in theory and practice, because working without one of them is impossible. To be successful and effective in their work, social workers use a range of theories, working models and concepts with their clients, adapting them to their needs. It should be noted that social workers have the main role in providing customer assistance, and that is why they will occupy an important place in this paper. Contently we will try to give a concise explanation of the theories of social work and theories for social work, as well as the great responsibility of social workers who face daily challenges in this sphere.",

Each decision making process produces a final choice and the output will be an action or an opinion of choice (Decision Making). Decision making is, however, only a step in planning, even when it is taken quickly, with little thoughts and information or when it effects action for few minutes only. Everyone takes decision daily in his life for every course of action. Seldom there is a chance to judge a course of action in isolation, as every decision has to gear up other plans. In public organization consensus can be a goal, not a mandate for public decision-making. Public policies are the mixture of our values and opinions, technical knowledge and abilities, and political set up. These are the views often conflict with one another, but when they differ from the individual views, generate disregard for the opinions and perspectives of others.",

Personal belief about capabilities to complete the task successfully show the behavioral choices, persistance, perforamnce and attitude. It helps to explain why people differ widely even having same knowledge, skills and abilities. Will I succeed or fail? Will I be liked or laughed at? Should I do it or not? Answers of these questions are based on personal efficacy (competence). Expectations of success or failure at a particular task is influenced by the sense of self-efficay in that area. High self-efficacy students engage in more effective self-regulatory strategies at each level of ability. High self-efficacy has been demonstrated by high academic achievement. On the contrary, low self-efficay destroy the personality that leads to anxiety, depression and other negative traits. Some low self-efficacious students give up on or never begin a task that leads to failure. 264 students of secondary classes from private and government high schools of Rawalpindi were randomly selected to administer a self-prepared 21 item Likert scale. Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient was applied by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The results showed that academic achievement was associated with sense of self-efficacy. Self-efficacious students are competent to approach difficult tasks to take mastery. High self-efficacious students show their competency as they put required effort to get their targets. They are able to solve even more difficult problems. Self-efficacy increases the self competency among students.",

Het redeneren over andermans denken is noodzakelijk in sociale interacties, om het gedrag van anderen te begrijpen. In tegenstelling tot andere studies, die impliceren dat ‘sociaal redeneren’ complex is en gelimiteerd door cognitieve capaciteiten, laten wij zien dat mensen beter kunnen worden in deze vaardigheid. Cognitieve limieten verdwijnen door simpele ingrepen, zoals stapsgewijs trainen, visuele ondersteuning en het stellen van vragen. Ons onderzoek laat tevens zien dat suboptimale uitkomsten in sociale interacties soms te wijten zijn aan het gebruik van verkeerde strategieen. Simpele ingrepen kunnen ook hier uitkomst zijn: door mensen te helpen betere strategieen te ontdekken en toepassen. De belangrijkste bevinding van dit proefschrift is dat mensen sociale interacties daadwerkelijk interpreteren in termen van andermans denken, ook al is een niet-mentale interpretatie die formeel equivalent is, mogelijk. Zo wordt een rationale computer opponent niet hetzelfde behandeld als een equivalent mechaniek, ook al is de uitkomst in beide situaties hetzelfde. Bovendien is het spelen van een spel vanuit het perspectief van een ander moeilijker dan het spelen van datzelfde spel vanuit het eigen perspectief. Met andere woorden, sociaal redeneren gaat echt over andermans denken. Als zodanig, is het een unieke cognitieve vaardigheid.",

'Achievement' becomes a category of high subjective significance, which requires constant intersubjective recognition. Motor behaviour as an objectifyable phenomenon must be distinguished from personal motor activity, at however limited a level of constitutional and functional motor competency it may occur. Expectation of success, and the avoidance of failure, are intrinsic constituents of educational reality in dealing with a physically disabled child.

    "title": "Emotional intelligence: a review of the literature with specific focus on empirical and epistemological perspectives",
    "abstract": "Aims and objectives. The aim of this literature review was to evaluate and discuss previous research on emotional intelligence with specific focus on empirical and epistemological perspectives. Background. The concept of emotional intelligence is derived from extensive research and theory about thoughts, feelings and abilities that, prior to 1990, were considered to be unrelated phenomena. Today, emotional intelligence attracts growing interest worldwide, contributing to critical reflection as well as to various educational, health and occupational outcomes. Method. Systematic review. Findings. The findings revealed that the epistemological tradition of natural science is the most frequently used and that, therefore, few articles related to humanistic sciences or philosophical perspectives were found. There is no agreement as to whether emotional intelligence is an individual ability, non‐cognitive skill, capability or competence. One important finding is that, regardless of the theoretical framework used, researchers agree that emotional intelligence embraces emotional awareness in relation to self and others, professional efficiency and emotional management. There have been some interesting theoretical frameworks that relate emotional intelligence to stress and mental health within different contexts. Emotional learning and maturation processes, i.e. personal growth and development in the area of emotional intelligence, are central to professional competence. Conclusions. There is no doubt that the research on emotional intelligence is scarce and still at the developmental stage. Clinical questions pertaining to the nursing profession should be developed with focus on personal qualities of relevance to nursing practice. Different approaches are needed in order to further expand the theoretical, empirical and philosophical foundation of this important and enigmatic concept. Relevance to clinical practice. Emotional intelligence may have implications for health promotion and quality of working life within nursing. Emotional intelligence seems to lead to more positive attitudes, greater adaptability, improved relationships and increased orientation towards positive values.",

    "title": "Understanding Academic Creativity: An Application Of “Flow” Concept In Spiritual Perspective",
    "abstract": "In general sense academic output is measured in terms of grades obtained by students taking a particular course or with the level of understanding generated while undergoing the course. The output in terms of A grades is quite easy to comprehend, although, holds little value, the deeper understanding of the course holds much merit, although, it’s very difficult to comprehend. It is seldom reckoned how creatively a particular course is conceived, designed, delivered and helped to serve the academic fraternity. We try to demonstrate our understanding in all the spheres of our life, in action oriented thoughts, in perception about events, in interaction with the environmental stimulus. We sometime get bored with the mundane routine activities, but, sometimes quite get involved and absorbed in the process. Why particular tasks become mundane to somebody, while it absorbs somebody? Is it creative stimulus? Is it environment stimulus? Is it the personality traits? Is it the subject itself? Being creative in one’s profession often holds its objective treatment to the concept of creativity which is understood to be an expression of the individual talent in a form which is not controlled by the individual itself; rather it is understood to be performed by somebody who is beyond the individual. It may sound little bit tiring and confusing to understand that “being absent” is basically “being present” in a form where the expression of inner understanding happens when one allows the “Flow”. The concept of “Flow” as proposed by Csikszentmihalyi is understood in a perspective where the optimal experience of an individual towards the context of intrinsic motivation and positive experience (Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi, 2002) is influenced by the individual interaction of person and the environment. “Flow” is also influenced by certain characteristics of motivation, happiness, satisfaction, strength and positive emotions involved in the process where the “Flow” of an individual is enhanced and not obstructed by certain forces (Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre, 1989). The study setting involves academicians from a top level Institute of National Importance engaged in different Engineering, Social Science and Management streams to understand the “Flow”. Primarily observation method along with semi structured questions is employed to understand the responses of the individual, where the responses were allowed to express itself without any obstruction. Responses were gathered in an informal setting so that the respondents may not become aware and try to be politically correct. The findings can be effectively used to design policy intervention at an individual level to cull out the creative genius from a person.",

    "abstract": "Mental health describes a level of psychological well-being, or an absence of a mental disorder. From perspective of 'positive psychology1 or 'holism, mental health may include an individual's ability to enjoy life, and create a balance between life activities and efforts to achieve psychological resilience. Life skills refer to abilities that help promote mental well being and competence in young people as they face realities of The World Health Organization has defined life skills as, the abilities for adaptive and positive behaviour that enable individuals to deal effectively with demands and challenges of everyday life. Many abilities like decision making, problem solving, creative thinking, critical thinking, effective communication, interpersonal relationship skills, self- awareness, empathy, coping with emotions, coping with stress are different life skills. Life skills based education and intervention programs cultivate necessary abilities among children at very early level to maintain emotional and mental health. Developing life skills helps people translate knowledge, attitudes and values into healthy behaviour, such as acquiring ability to reduce special health risks and adopt healthy behaviour that improve their lives in general such as planning ahead, coping with stress and emotion, decision-making, and forming positive relationships.",

    "abstract": "To understand how persons self‐regulate, we need, as Cervone, Shadel, Smith, and Fiori (2006 ) assert, to refer to personality science, with which it is possible to identify the multifarious psychological elements and processes helping or hindering action programming, overcoming difficulties, and error correction. Personality disorder research and personality science itself demonstrate that dysfunctions in two skills—self‐monitoring and mindreading—worsen self‐regulation and lead individuals to fail chronically to achieve goals in the social domain. Here we describe how poor self‐reflection and biased mindreading impair self‐regulation in personality disorders and other clinical conditions and make some suggestions about how to tackle them in psychotherapy.",

    "title": "APROXIMACIÓN CONDUCTUAL A LA NOCIÓN DE APRENDIZAJE AUTÓNOMO",
    "abstract": "The new technologies and the rapid advance of knowledge highlight the relevance of adaptation to this changing context and the objective of being able to learn by oneself throughout life. Learner tasks considered as autonomous would include solving problems by oneself, raising new ones, and any activity carried out without the presence or collaboration of others. However, beyond these examples, there has been no development of the behaviouristic criteria for identifying a type of learning as autonomous and distinguishing it from another, non-autonomous type. The present work aims to help to delimit this notion, doing so within a behavioural epistemological framework. Assuming that the use of a term establishes its meanings, we analyze the way the term autonomous learning is normally employed, and derive several relevant aspects for the wanted definition.",

    "title": "Locus of Control as an Important Factor in Teacher's Rating of Highly Able Children",
    "abstract": "In our study on the identification of giftedness the role of intellectual and non-intellectual factors and their relation to each other are being investigated in the development of giftedness. We think that non-intellectual factors (positive personality traits, motivation, interest, etc.) do not predict giftedness in themselves but they are absolutely necessary in the actualisation of abilities. We presume that in some cases (“late-bloomers”, unequal development of intellectual, emotional and social factors) it is some personality characteristic that might play a decisive role in helping to foster the intellectual development. In this way the fact that the teacher notices some positive personality traits (strong internal control, responsibility, wide range of interests, strength of will etc.) and evaluates the child positively even if s/he does not really have good achievement, yet, can enhance the chance for later development.",
