## **The Biological and Neurological Basis of Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder**

### Introduction

Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED) represents a profound disturbance in social relatedness, characterized by a pattern of culturally inappropriate, overly familiar behavior with relative strangers (Bernet et al., 2010). This disorder, rooted in early childhood experiences of social neglect or deprivation, is not merely a behavioral issue but is increasingly understood as a neurodevelopmental condition (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015). The absence of adequate, consistent caregiving during critical developmental periods appears to fundamentally alter the biological and neurological systems that govern social behavior, attachment, and emotional regulation (Dozier et al., 2013; Sroufe, 1985). While the behavioral phenotype of DSED includes indiscriminate sociability and a lack of reticence with unfamiliar adults, the underlying mechanisms are deeply embedded in the child's neurobiology, shaped by experiences of profound adversity (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Repetti et al., 2002).

The primary etiological factor for DSED is severe social neglect, most starkly exemplified by institutional rearing (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Groark & McCall, 2011). Children raised in institutions often experience a high number of changing caregivers, limited one-on-one interaction, and a lack of contingently responsive caregiving (Groark & McCall, 2011; Yabar-Gago, 2019; 최종훈 유재현, 2011). This environment of "maternal deprivation" (Kennell & Bergen, 1966) or "deficient parental care" (Andersson, 2018) fundamentally disrupts the formation of selective attachments, which are crucial for normative social development (Ainsworth, 1989; Bowlby, 2013). The indiscriminate social behavior seen in DSED can be conceptualized as a maladaptive strategy developed in an environment where forming a specific, secure bond with a primary caregiver is not possible (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015).

From a biological perspective, these early adverse experiences are not passive events; they become biologically embedded, shaping the very architecture of the developing brain (Eisenberg, 1999; Raiten et al., 2025). The chronic stress associated with neglect, abuse, or institutionalization (Evans & Kim, 2012; Repetti et al., 2002) is believed to dysregulate key neurobiological systems, including stress-responsive hormonal axes and neurotransmitter pathways that underpin social cognition, fear learning, and reward processing (Granata, 2023). Consequently, the disinhibited social behaviors are not a conscious choice but rather the outward manifestation of a nervous system calibrated for an environment devoid of predictable, nurturing relationships (Narváez, 2019).

This chapter will explore the biological and neurological foundations of DSED, drawing exclusively on an analysis of the provided literature. While direct neurobiological studies of DSED are not present within this corpus, the extensive documentation of the psychosocial precursors and developmental consequences of early adversity allows for a synthesized, inferential understanding of the underlying mechanisms. We will examine how factors such as institutional care, family dysfunction, and attachment disruption—all well-documented risk factors for social maladjustment (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Fagan & Wexler, 1987; Repetti et al., 2002)—can be understood to shape the neurodevelopmental pathways that culminate in the DSED phenotype. This exploration will cover the putative roles of neurobiological systems, genetic and molecular factors, brain structure and function, and developmental neurobiology, ultimately framing DSED as a disorder of the developing social brain, profoundly shaped by the quality of early caregiving environments.

### Neurobiological Systems

The behavioral manifestations of DSED, such as a lack of appropriate social boundaries and an eagerness to engage with unfamiliar adults, are hypothesized to stem from dysregulation within several core neurobiological systems (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015). Although the provided literature does not contain specific neuropharmacological studies, it offers a rich foundation for understanding how early environmental adversity impacts stress-responsive systems, which are foundational to social and emotional regulation (Repetti et al., 2002; Evans & Kim, 2012).

**The Stress-Response System**

One of the most profoundly affected systems in children experiencing social neglect is the stress-response system, primarily involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and the sympathetic-adrenomedullary system (Repetti et al., 2002). Chronic stress, a hallmark of "risky families" characterized by conflict, aggression, and neglect (Repetti et al., 2002; Fagan & Wexler, 1987), is known to disrupt the normal functioning of these biological regulatory systems (Evans & Kim, 2012). Children in institutional care, foster care, or dysfunctional homes are exposed to prolonged and unpredictable stressors (Groark & McCall, 2011; Mynard, 2006; Haugland, 2005). This chronic activation can overwhelm physiological response systems designed for acute demands, leading to long-term alterations in their calibration (Evans & Kim, 2012; Granata, 2023).

The lack of a consistent, nurturing caregiver to buffer stress responses is a critical factor (Dozier et al., 2013). In typical development, a caregiver’s sensitive responsiveness helps the infant co-regulate distress, promoting the development of a well-modulated stress system (Feldman et al., 2013; Tsang et al., 2019). In environments of neglect, this co-regulation is absent, leaving the infant's immature systems to manage overwhelming stress alone (Dozier et al., 2013; Sroufe, 1985). This can lead to a state of hypervigilance or, conversely, a blunted physiological response to threat, both of which could contribute to maladaptive social behaviors (Granata, 2023). The disinhibited approach to strangers in DSED may reflect a failure of the stress-response system to signal potential danger in unfamiliar social encounters, a function that is normally calibrated through early attachment relationships (Heathers, 1954; Sroufe, 1985).

**Neurotransmitter Systems and Reward Processing**

Social bonding and attachment are mediated by complex neurochemical processes, particularly involving neuropeptides like oxytocin and vasopressin, and neurotransmitters like dopamine, which are central to reward and motivation (Swain et al., 2012). The formation of selective attachments is a rewarding process that reinforces proximity and interaction with a specific caregiver (Ainsworth, 1989). Children who experience early deprivation, such as those in institutions, lack the consistent, positive social interactions that are necessary for the normal development of these reward pathways (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Groark & McCall, 2011).

The indiscriminate friendliness of DSED could be interpreted as a dysfunction in the brain's reward system. Lacking the experience of a primary, rewarding attachment figure, these children may seek social stimulation from any available adult, failing to differentiate between familiar caregivers and strangers (Marshall & McCandless, 1957). This behavior may be driven by a generalized, non-selective seeking of social reward, reflecting a system that has not been tuned to prioritize a specific attachment figure (Swain et al., 2012). Furthermore, parental substance abuse, a common feature in the backgrounds of children in the child welfare system (Mynard, 2006; Alexander & Dibb, 1975), directly impacts these same neurochemical systems in the parent and creates a chaotic, unpredictable environment for the child, further disrupting the development of the child's own regulatory and reward systems (Levine, 1985; Johnson et al., 1998). This intergenerational transmission of risk can create a cycle where parental substance use disorders contribute to a caregiving environment that fosters attachment and regulatory problems in their children (Rohde et al., 2007).

**The Opiate System and Social Bonding**

The endogenous opioid system is also implicated in the pleasurable feelings associated with social connection and the pain of social separation (Alexander & Dibb, 1975). The comfort and warmth of a secure attachment relationship are thought to be mediated, in part, by the release of endogenous opioids (Gelenberg, 1989). Conversely, the distress of separation from an attachment figure involves a state akin to opioid withdrawal (Hoff et al., 1994). For children in institutional settings, the constant change of caregivers and lack of stable bonds means they may not experience the neurochemical rewards of attachment, while simultaneously experiencing the chronic stress of social loss or absence (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Clara, 2015). This may lead to an altered baseline in the opioid system, potentially contributing to a reduced fear of strangers and a diminished capacity to form deep, selective emotional bonds later in life (Datani, 2016). The link between parental opiate addiction and family dysfunction further highlights the vulnerability of these systems, suggesting that both genetic predispositions and environmental exposure in these families may converge to disrupt the neurobiology of social bonding in offspring (Alexander & Dibb, 1975).

In summary, while specific molecular evidence is absent from the provided texts, a strong theoretical case can be built linking the psychosocial adversities of neglect and institutionalization to the dysregulation of the stress-response, reward, and opioid systems. These neurobiological alterations likely form the core substrate for the indiscriminate and disinhibited social behaviors that define DSED.

### Genetic and Molecular Basis

The development of Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder is fundamentally rooted in environmental adversity, specifically the absence of adequate caregiving (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015). However, a complete biological understanding requires consideration of genetic factors that may confer vulnerability or resilience to such environmental insults (Repetti et al., 2002). The provided literature points toward a model where genetic predisposition and environmental factors work in tandem to shape developmental outcomes (Hemmingsson et al., 2022).

**Heritability and Gene-Environment Interaction**

While no studies on the specific heritability of DSED are available in the provided corpus, research on related outcomes suggests a role for genetics. For instance, studies of adoptees have shown that a biological background of alcoholism increases the risk for alcoholism in the adoptee, even when raised in a different environment, pointing to a genetic component for certain behavioral disorders (Cadoret & Gath, 1978). Similarly, antisocial behavior and other forms of psychopathology that are sometimes comorbid with attachment disorders have been linked to a combination of genetic risk and adverse family environments (Jaffee et al., 2003; Repetti et al., 2002).

This suggests a gene-environment interaction (GxE) model for DSED. Children may be born with genetic variations that affect the sensitivity of their neurobiological systems, such as those governing stress reactivity or social reward (Granata, 2023). In a supportive, nurturing environment, these genetic differences may have little or no negative impact. However, when exposed to the severe neglect characteristic of institutional rearing or dysfunctional families (Groark & McCall, 2011; Fagan & Wexler, 1987), these genetic vulnerabilities may be "activated," leading to the maladaptive neurodevelopmental pathways that result in DSED (Hemmingsson et al., 2022). For example, a child with a genetically-based high reactivity to stress might be particularly vulnerable to the chaotic and unresponsive care found in some institutions, leading to more severe dysregulation of the HPA axis and associated social-emotional difficulties (Repetti et al., 2002). This aligns with broader findings that "unfavorable hereditary tendencies" combined with a "total lack of security in human relationships" and a "disturbed home life" create the highest risk for severe psychopathology in children (Yerbury & Newell, 1944).

**Intergenerational Transmission**

The concept of intergenerational transmission of risk, which is a recurring theme in the literature, provides further, albeit indirect, evidence for a genetic and molecular basis (Hemmingsson et al., 2022; Weatherburn & Lind, 2000). Parents who themselves have a history of psychopathology, substance abuse, or antisocial behavior are more likely to create a risky family environment for their children (Wagner et al., 2003; Fagan & Wexler, 1987). This transmission can occur through multiple mechanisms. First, parents may pass on genetic vulnerabilities for these conditions to their offspring (Cadoret & Gath, 1978). Second, the parents' own behavioral problems disrupt their ability to provide sensitive and responsive care, creating the very environment of neglect that is the primary cause of DSED (Newcomb & Loeb, 1999; Repetti et al., 2002).

For example, a mother with a history of her own attachment disruptions may have difficulty forming a secure bond with her infant, perpetuating a cycle of insecure attachment across generations (Jacobvitz et al., 1991). This cycle is not purely psychosocial; it likely involves the transmission of both genetic factors related to social-emotional functioning and the environmental conditions that shape how those genes are expressed (Bengtsson & Psouni, 2008). The finding that family history of affective disorders, antisocial disorders, and substance abuse are consistent risk factors for youth suicidal behaviors and other maladjustment highlights this convergence of genetic and environmental pathways (Wagner et al., 2003).

**Molecular Mechanisms: An Inferential Approach**

At the molecular level, chronic stress from early adversity is known to induce epigenetic modifications—changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. While the provided sources do not discuss epigenetics, we can infer its relevance. The "biological embedding of environmental risk" (Jenkins et al., 2015) likely occurs through such molecular mechanisms. Experiences of neglect and abuse (Young et al., 1999) could lead to lasting changes in the expression of genes involved in the regulation of the stress-response system (e.g., glucocorticoid receptors) and in neurotransmitter systems that mediate social behavior (Granata, 2023). These molecular "scars" could explain the persistence of DSED symptoms even after a child is placed in an improved environment, such as a high-quality foster or adoptive home (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015). The observation that some children show considerable "catch up" while others have remaining difficulties (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015) could be due to individual differences in genetic resilience and the degree to which these epigenetic changes are reversible.

In conclusion, the genetic and molecular basis of DSED is likely complex, involving an intricate interplay between inherited vulnerabilities and the profound impact of the early caregiving environment. The provided literature supports a model of gene-environment interaction and intergenerational transmission, where family history and early adversity converge to shape the neurodevelopmental trajectories leading to the disorder.

### Brain Structure and Function

The profound behavioral alterations in DSED are presumed to be the surface manifestation of underlying differences in brain structure and function (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015). While the provided research corpus lacks direct neuroimaging or neuroanatomical studies, the extensive literature on the cognitive, emotional, and social consequences of early deprivation provides a basis for inferring which neural systems are likely implicated. The consistent finding that early, severe neglect leads to developmental delays across multiple domains suggests a widespread impact on brain development (Groark & McCall, 2011; van IJzendoorn et al., 2015).

**Functional Deficits and Implicated Neural Circuits**

The core symptoms of DSED—indiscriminate sociability and a lack of reticence with strangers—point to dysfunction in the neural circuits that govern social cognition, fear processing, and attachment (Dozier et al., 2013).

*   **Social Cognition and the "Social Brain":** The ability to form selective attachments and navigate social relationships appropriately depends on a network of brain regions often referred to as the "social brain," which includes areas responsible for understanding others' intentions, processing faces, and experiencing empathy (Swain et al., 2012). The development of these circuits is highly experience-dependent, shaped by early social interactions (Eisenberg, 1999; Tomasello, 2008). The impoverished social environment of many institutions, with its high caregiver-to-child ratios and lack of individualized, responsive interaction, fails to provide the necessary inputs for the proper maturation of these systems (Groark & McCall, 2011; Yabar-Gago, 2019). The "quasi-autistic" features sometimes observed in institutionalized children, such as impaired eye gaze and joint attention (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Carter et al., 2014), reflect a failure in the development of these fundamental social-cognitive skills and their underlying neural substrates.

*   **Fear and Safety Processing (Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex):** A key feature of DSED is the absence of typical fear or wariness toward strangers (Marshall & McCandless, 1957). In normally developing children, the amygdala and its connections with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are crucial for learning to distinguish between safe, familiar attachment figures and potentially threatening strangers (Sroufe, 1985). This learning process is guided by the caregiver, who serves as a "secure base" from which to explore and a "safe haven" in times of threat (Ainsworth, 1989). Children deprived of such a figure do not receive the consistent feedback needed to calibrate their fear-learning circuits (Dozier et al., 2013). Consequently, the amygdala may fail to be appropriately activated by unfamiliar social stimuli, and the PFC may fail to exert regulatory control, leading to disinhibited approach behavior (Granata, 2023). This is not an absence of fear in general, but a specific deficit in social fear regulation.

*   **Attachment and Reward (Limbic System):** The formation of a secure attachment bond is a deeply rewarding process that involves limbic structures integral to emotion and motivation (Swain et al., 2012). The lack of opportunity to form a stable, selective attachment in an institutional setting (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Zsubrits & Szikra, 2008) likely results in atypical development of these circuits. The indiscriminate friendliness of DSED may represent a search for social reward that is not channeled toward a specific figure, reflecting an underdeveloped or poorly differentiated attachment system (Marshall & McCandless, 1957).

**Structural Brain Alterations**

The functional deficits described above are likely paralleled by structural changes in the brain. Chronic exposure to high levels of stress hormones, as experienced by neglected children, is known to be neurotoxic, potentially affecting the development of brain regions sensitive to stress, such as the hippocampus (involved in memory) and the prefrontal cortex (involved in executive function and emotional regulation) (Repetti et al., 2002; Evans & Kim, 2012). Furthermore, the lack of cognitive and social stimulation in deprived environments (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015) can lead to reduced synaptic density and altered white matter development, a phenomenon consistent with the principle that experience shapes brain structure (Eisenberg, 1999).

The developmental delays observed in institutionalized children across physical, cognitive, and social-emotional domains (Groark & McCall, 2011) are strong, albeit indirect, evidence of widespread effects on brain development. While placement in a high-quality foster or adoptive family can lead to significant "catch-up" in development, suggesting a degree of neuroplasticity, some difficulties often remain, particularly in the social and emotional domains (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015). This persistence suggests that early deprivation may cause structural changes that are not fully reversible, leaving a lasting vulnerability.

In conclusion, while the provided literature does not offer direct neuroimaging evidence, the pattern of functional impairments associated with early, severe neglect strongly implicates the neural circuits responsible for social cognition, fear regulation, and attachment. The indiscriminate social behavior of DSED can be conceptualized as a functional outcome of a brain that has adapted to an environment devoid of stable, nurturing relationships, leading to atypical development of these critical neural systems.

### Developmental Neurobiology

Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder is fundamentally a disorder of development, emerging from a mismatch between a child's innate biological need for attachment and an environment that fails to provide it (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Dozier et al., 2013). The principles of developmental neurobiology, which emphasize critical or sensitive periods during which the brain is uniquely plastic and responsive to environmental input, are essential for understanding the disorder's origins and persistence (Eisenberg, 1999).

**Critical Periods for Attachment and Social Development**

The first few years of life represent a sensitive period for the formation of attachment relationships (Ainsworth, 1989; Sroufe, 1985). During this time, the infant's brain is rapidly developing circuits for social interaction, emotional regulation, and stress modulation, largely through interactions with a primary caregiver (Feldman et al., 2013; Swain et al., 2012). The caregiver's role is not passive; they actively structure interactions, creating a "scaffold" for the infant's developing social skills (Vandell & Wilson, 1987; Bakeman & Adamson, 1984). Through predictable, responsive care, the infant learns to trust the caregiver as a source of safety and comfort, forming a secure attachment that becomes the "internal working model" for future relationships (Bowlby, 2013; Sroufe, 1985).

The environment of institutional care directly disrupts this process (Groark & McCall, 2011; van IJzendoorn et al., 2015). With high child-to-caregiver ratios, frequent staff turnover, and care organized around tasks rather than relationships, infants in institutions are deprived of the opportunity to form a stable, selective bond (Yabar-Gago, 2019; 최종훈 유재현, 2011). This "maternal deprivation" (Kennell & Bergen, 1966) or "deprivational abuse" (Golden, 2003) during a critical neurodevelopmental window is the primary pathogenic mechanism leading to DSED. The brain circuits that should be tuned to recognize and prefer a specific attachment figure fail to specialize, resulting in a generalized and indiscriminate orientation toward all adults (Marshall & McCandless, 1957). The infant learns that no single person is a reliable source of comfort, and thus does not develop the selective social preference and stranger wariness that are hallmarks of typical attachment development around 8-12 months of age (Heathers, 1954; Jellinek & Kearns, 1995).

**The Role of Early Experience in Shaping Neural Systems**

Experience shapes the brain (Eisenberg, 1999). The development of complex behaviors depends on the interaction of genetic predispositions with environmental inputs during sensitive periods (Repetti et al., 2002). For social behavior, the most critical input is the social environment itself (Tomasello, 2008). Responsive social interactions—the "give-and-take" of early conversation (Masataka, 2003), shared attention to objects (Bigelow et al., 2004; Bakeman & Adamson, 1984), and sensitive comforting (Beth & Fechter-Leggett, 2012)—drive the pruning and strengthening of synaptic connections in the social brain.

In institutional settings, this crucial social input is often absent or distorted. Interactions are perfunctory and lack emotional warmth (Groark & McCall, 2011). The lack of a "secure base" inhibits exploratory behavior and learning (Sroufe, 1985), and the absence of a reliable "safe haven" leaves the infant's stress systems unregulated (Dozier et al., 2013). This impoverished experience leads to atypical development. For example, joint attention skills, which are foundational for social learning and language, are often delayed in institutionalized children (Carter et al., 2014), reflecting the lack of scaffolded interactions with a consistent adult (Bigelow et al., 2004). The neurobiological consequence is a brain that is poorly adapted for the nuanced, reciprocal, and selective nature of typical human social relationships (Feldman et al., 2013).

**Neuroplasticity and the Potential for Recovery**

The concept of developmental plasticity also offers hope. While early deprivation can have profound effects, the brain retains a capacity for change, especially if intervention occurs early (Eisenberg, 1999). Studies show that when children are removed from deprived institutional environments and placed into high-quality, stable foster or adoptive care, they can show remarkable "catch-up" in physical, cognitive, and even social-emotional development (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Holá, 1995). The provision of a sensitive, responsive caregiver allows for the formation of a new attachment relationship, which can begin to repair the developmental damage (Dozier et al., 2013). This recovery is a neurobiological process, reflecting the brain's ability to form new connections and recalibrate systems in response to an enriched, predictable, and nurturing environment.

However, the recovery is often incomplete (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015). The sensitive period for attachment is not infinitely plastic. Children who spend longer periods in deprived environments, or who are adopted at older ages, are more likely to have persistent difficulties, including symptoms of DSED (Hodges & Tizard, 1989; Curreli, 2018). This suggests that the early absence of key experiences may lead to irreversible changes or establish maladaptive patterns that are highly resistant to change, leaving a lasting vulnerability in the neurobiological systems for social engagement. The developmental trajectory has been altered, and while it can be redirected, the starting point of adversity continues to exert an influence throughout the life course (Repetti et al., 2002; Jenkins et al., 2015).

### Treatment Mechanisms

Interventions for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder are primarily psychosocial, focusing on creating a stable and nurturing caregiving environment to remediate the effects of early deprivation (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Dozier et al., 2013). From a biological perspective, these treatments are not merely behavioral but are powerful neurobiological interventions. They aim to leverage the brain's inherent plasticity to reshape the neural circuits that were miscalibrated by early adversity (Eisenberg, 1999).

**Restoring the Caregiving Environment: A Neurobiological Imperative**

The most potent intervention for a child with DSED is placement in a stable, sensitive, and responsive caregiving environment, typically a high-quality foster or adoptive family (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Holá, 1995; Kalland & Sinkkonen, 2001). The biological mechanism of this intervention is the provision of the experiential inputs that were missing during critical developmental periods. A consistent caregiver who is "crazy about them" (Unknown, 2003) provides the predictable, contingent interactions necessary for the development of secure attachment (Sroufe, 1985; Dozier et al., 2013).

This process has direct neurobiological consequences. The presence of a nurturing caregiver helps to down-regulate the child's chronically activated stress-response systems (Repetti et al., 2002). Warm, affectionate interactions stimulate the release of endogenous opioids and oxytocin, activating the brain's reward pathways and facilitating the formation of a new, selective bond (Swain et al., 2012). The caregiver scaffolds social interactions, such as joint attention and turn-taking, providing the structured input needed to build and strengthen neural pathways in the "social brain" (Bigelow et al., 2004; Bakeman & Adamson, 1984). The observed "catch-up" in development following placement in a good-quality family environment (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015) is the behavioral manifestation of this underlying neural repair and reorganization.

**Interventions Targeting the Caregiver-Child Relationship**

Specific therapeutic models have been developed to support foster and adoptive parents in caring for children with histories of maltreatment and attachment disruption (Dozier et al., 2013). These interventions often focus on training caregivers to be more sensitive and responsive to the child's cues and to provide a consistent "secure base" (Ainsworth, 1989). For example, interventions might coach parents to increase nurturing behaviors and to respond synchronously to their child's needs, thereby promoting the development of an organized attachment (Dozier et al., 2013).

The biological mechanism of such interventions is to enhance the quality of the relational environment, making it more therapeutically potent. By teaching a caregiver to read a child's often confusing or dysregulated signals, the intervention helps create the contingent feedback loop necessary for healthy neurodevelopment (Feldman et al., 2013). The caregiver learns to act as an external regulator for the child's emotions and behavior, a role that the child gradually internalizes as their own self-regulatory capacities mature (Evans & Kim, 2012). This process is thought to promote functional connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, enhancing top-down control over emotional and social responses (Granata, 2023). Family therapy approaches similarly aim to improve family functioning, reduce conflict, and strengthen positive relationships, which creates a more stable and less stressful environment, thereby supporting the child's neurobiological recovery (Serrano et al., 1962; Essex et al., 1996).

**Challenges and the Limits of Plasticity**

Despite the potential for recovery, treatment is often challenging. Children with DSED may struggle to form a selective attachment, continuing to show indiscriminate friendliness even with a dedicated caregiver (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015). Their internal working models, shaped by early experiences of abandonment or neglect, may lead them to distrust caregivers and resist intimacy (Datani, 2016). These behaviors can be stressful for caregivers, potentially disrupting the very relationship that is meant to be therapeutic (Dozier et al., 2013; Thompson et al., 2014).

From a neurobiological standpoint, these challenges reflect the enduring impact of early adversity. The sensitive period for attachment may have passed, leaving some neural systems less amenable to change (Eisenberg, 1999). Maladaptive patterns of social reward seeking may be deeply ingrained and difficult to modify. Therefore, while psychosocial interventions are the treatment of choice, their success depends on the degree of residual neural plasticity, the timing and quality of the intervention, and the capacity of the new caregiving environment to tolerate and manage the child's challenging behaviors (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015). The goal of treatment is not necessarily to erase the past, but to provide a new set of relational experiences that can foster the development of compensatory neural and behavioral strategies, allowing the child to form more adaptive and selective social relationships over time.

### Biological Subtypes and Heterogeneity

Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder, while defined by a core set of behaviors, is not a monolithic entity. The expression and severity of the disorder can vary significantly among individuals, suggesting underlying heterogeneity that may be rooted in distinct biological and etiological pathways (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015). Although the provided literature does not explicitly define biological subtypes, it offers a framework for conceptualizing this heterogeneity based on the nature of the early adverse environment and the child's individual characteristics.

**Etiological Heterogeneity**

The pathogenic environment of "social neglect" is varied (Dubowitz et al., 1993). Different forms of deprivation likely exert different pressures on the developing brain, potentially leading to distinct neurobiological and behavioral profiles.

1.  **Institutional Deprivation:** This is the most well-documented pathway to DSED (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Groark & McCall, 2011). The key feature is the lack of a stable, primary attachment figure due to high caregiver turnover and routinized, impersonal care (Yabar-Gago, 2019; 최종훈 유재현, 2011). This environment may lead to a subtype of DSED characterized by a primary failure to form selective attachments. The underlying neurobiology may involve an underdeveloped attachment system, with a failure to differentiate the neural response to familiar versus unfamiliar adults (Sroufe, 1985).

2.  **Maltreatment within the Family:** Some children develop DSED-like behaviors within their biological families, which may be characterized by severe neglect, abuse, or chaos (Young et al., 1999; Fagan & Wexler, 1987). In these "risky families" (Repetti et al., 2002), the child may form an attachment, but it is often disorganized, reflecting a caregiver who is simultaneously a source of comfort and fear (Solomon & George, 2011). This could lead to a subtype of DSED where disinhibited behavior coexists with signs of disorganized attachment, such as contradictory or confused behaviors toward caregivers. The neurobiology here might involve a conflict between the attachment and fear systems, leading to a dysregulated and unpredictable pattern of social engagement (Lyons Ruth, 2004). Parental substance abuse or mental illness are common contributors to this chaotic family environment, suggesting specific neurobiological and genetic risk factors may be at play (Seifer, 2003; Rohde et al., 2007).

3.  **Multiple Foster Placements:** Children who experience numerous moves within the foster care system suffer repeated disruptions of attachment bonds (Rittner et al., 2011; Unrau et al., 2010). Even if some placements are with nurturing caregivers, the repeated loss can be traumatic and prevent the consolidation of a secure internal working model (Dozier et al., 2013). This may result in a subtype of DSED characterized by a superficial sociability that masks a deep-seated fear of abandonment and an inability to commit to new relationships (Tennyson, 2013). The underlying biology may involve a sensitized stress-response system and an avoidance of the neurochemical "pain" of attachment loss, leading to a strategy of shallow, transient connections.

**Heterogeneity in Comorbidity and Outcome**

The clinical presentation of DSED is also heterogeneous. Some children exhibit "pure" disinhibited behavior, while others present with comorbid conditions. For example, van IJzendoorn et al. (2015) describe how institutional rearing can lead to either "indiscriminate social behavior" or "quasi-autistic" features. This suggests that early deprivation can push development along different pathological trajectories, likely reflecting an interaction between the specific nature of the deprivation and the child's individual vulnerabilities (Repetti et al., 2002).

Furthermore, children with a history of neglect show a wide range of outcomes. Some may primarily exhibit the externalizing, disinhibited behaviors of DSED, while others may show more internalizing problems like anxiety and depression (Clara, 2015). This divergence could reflect different underlying biological profiles. For instance, one child's stress system might become chronically hyperactive, leading to anxiety, while another's might become hypo-responsive, contributing to a lack of social fear and disinhibition (Granata, 2023). Individual differences in temperament and genetic makeup undoubtedly play a role in shaping these diverse outcomes (Sroufe, 1985).

In summary, the concept of a single "DSED biology" is likely an oversimplification. The disorder is better conceptualized as a final common behavioral pathway resulting from several distinct etiological routes. Future research should aim to delineate these subtypes by integrating detailed histories of early adversity with assessments of comorbid psychopathology and, critically, with direct measures of neurobiological functioning. Understanding this heterogeneity is crucial for developing more targeted and effective interventions.

### Future Directions

The collective body of research provided offers a robust and compelling account of the profound impact of the early psychosocial environment on child development, establishing a strong foundation for understanding disorders of social engagement. The literature consistently links early adversity—such as institutional rearing, family dysfunction, neglect, and disrupted attachments—to a range of negative outcomes, including the disinhibited and maladaptive social behaviors characteristic of DSED (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Repetti et al., 2002; Groark & McCall, 2011; Dozier et al., 2013). However, a significant gap remains in the direct elucidation of the biological and neurological mechanisms that mediate this relationship. The provided sources allow us to build a strong inferential case, but they highlight the urgent need for research that bridges the gap between psychosocial observation and neurobiological measurement.

A primary direction for future research is the direct investigation of the neural circuits implicated in DSED. While we can hypothesize that the "social brain," amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and reward pathways are involved (Swain et al., 2012; Granata, 2023), these hypotheses require empirical testing. Longitudinal studies employing structural and functional neuroimaging (e.g., MRI, fMRI) are needed. Such studies could follow children from high-risk environments, such as institutions or the child welfare system, and track changes in brain development in relation to both their early experiences and their subsequent placement in nurturing or less-optimal environments (Kortenkamp & Ehrle, 2002). This would allow researchers to identify the specific neural signatures of early deprivation and to map the neurobiological processes of recovery and "catch-up" (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015).

Second, the role of specific neurochemical and hormonal systems must be explored more directly. The literature on stress (Evans & Kim, 2012; Repetti et al., 2002) strongly suggests dysregulation of the HPA axis. Future studies should measure cortisol patterns and reactivity in children with DSED to confirm this. Similarly, the hypothesized roles of oxytocin, vasopressin, dopamine, and endogenous opioids in mediating attachment and social reward (Swain et al., 2012) need to be investigated. This could involve measuring peripheral levels of these substances or, in animal models, directly manipulating these systems to observe effects on social behavior following early deprivation (Gromov, 2011; Yano‐Nashimoto et al., 2023).

Third, the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of DSED represent a critical frontier. The current literature supports a gene-environment interaction model (Hemmingsson et al., 2022), but the specific genes involved are unknown. Candidate gene studies could examine polymorphisms in genes related to the stress-response system (e.g., glucocorticoid receptor gene) or neurotransmitter systems (e.g., dopamine and serotonin transporter genes) to see if they moderate the impact of early neglect on DSED symptoms. Furthermore, epigenetics offers a powerful tool for understanding how adversity gets "under the skin" (Repetti et al., 2002). Studies examining DNA methylation patterns in children with DSED could identify the molecular mechanisms through which early experience alters long-term gene expression and brain function.

Fourth, the heterogeneity of DSED requires further exploration. The proposal of subtypes based on etiology (e.g., institutional deprivation vs. in-family maltreatment) needs to be tested with biological measures (Fagan & Wexler, 1987; van IJzendoorn et al., 2015). It is plausible that different pathways to DSED result in distinct neurobiological profiles, which may, in turn, have different prognoses and require different treatment approaches. For instance, a child whose disinhibition stems from a primary failure to form an attachment may have a different neural profile and treatment needs than a child whose behavior stems from a disorganized attachment to an abusive caregiver (Solomon & George, 2011).

Finally, the biological mechanisms of treatment need to be better understood. We assume that providing a nurturing environment promotes neural plasticity (Eisenberg, 1999), but how this occurs is a black box. Research could use neuroimaging before and after evidence-based interventions (e.g., attachment-focused therapies for foster parents; Dozier et al., 2013) to document treatment-related changes in brain structure and function. This would not only validate the neurobiological basis of these psychosocial therapies but could also help refine them to be more effective.

In essence, the future of DSED research lies in integrating the rich psychosocial knowledge base, exemplified by the provided literature, with the powerful tools of modern neuroscience. The "what" (the adverse environment) and the "so what" (the behavioral outcome) are well-described; the "how" (the mediating biological mechanisms) is the critical next step.

### Conclusion

Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder is a complex and challenging condition that arises from one of the most fundamental failures of the early human environment: the absence of a stable, nurturing, and selective attachment relationship (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015; Dozier et al., 2013). The evidence synthesized from the provided body of literature, though lacking direct neurobiological data, constructs a coherent and compelling picture of DSED as a neurodevelopmental disorder. Its origins lie not in inherent pathology, but in the biological embedding of profound early psychosocial adversity (Repetti et al., 2002; Jenkins et al., 2015).

The behavioral hallmarks of the disorder—an indiscriminate and overly familiar approach to strangers—can be understood as a logical, albeit maladaptive, developmental outcome for a child whose early environment did not support the formation of a specific, secure attachment bond (Sroufe, 1985). Environments of severe neglect, particularly institutional rearing, are characterized by a deficit of the consistent, responsive, and emotionally available caregiving that is essential for tuning the developing brain's social, emotional, and stress-regulatory circuits (Groark & McCall, 2011; Eisenberg, 1999).

We have inferred that this experiential deprivation leads to the dysregulation of key neurobiological systems. The chronic stress of an unresponsive or chaotic environment likely alters the calibration of the HPA axis and other stress-response systems, leading to an atypical response to social threat (Evans & Kim, 2012). The lack of a primary, rewarding attachment figure is hypothesized to disrupt the development of the brain's reward and motivation circuits, leading to a non-selective and generalized seeking of social contact (Swain et al., 2012). These functional alterations are almost certainly accompanied by structural changes in the brain, shaped by a combination of gene-environment interactions and the powerful influence of experience on neural architecture (Hemmingsson et al., 2022; Eisenberg, 1999).

Ultimately, DSED serves as a stark reminder of the profound and lasting impact of the early caregiving environment on human biology. The disorder is a testament to the brain's remarkable plasticity and its capacity to adapt to the environment it encounters, even when that environment is pathologically deficient. While this plasticity also offers a window for recovery through interventions that provide nurturing and stable care (van IJzendoorn et al., 2015), the persistence of symptoms in many cases underscores the critical importance of the sensitive periods of early development. A comprehensive understanding of DSED, therefore, requires a biopsychosocial perspective that fully acknowledges the intricate and inextricable link between our earliest relationships and the very wiring of our brains. The path forward must integrate the psychosocial wisdom of the past with the neurobiological tools of the future to better prevent and treat this devastating disorder of social connection.
