# Chapter 7: The Biological and Neurological Basis of Phencyclidine Use Disorder

## Introduction

Phencyclidine Use Disorder represents a significant clinical and public health challenge, characterized by a complex constellation of psychological, behavioral, and physiological sequelae stemming from the misuse of the synthetic arylcyclohexylamine, phencyclidine (PCP) (Dove, 1984; Cohen, 1979). Originally synthesized in the 1920s and later explored as a promising intravenous anesthetic agent under the trade name Sernylan in the late 1950s, PCP's initial therapeutic potential was quickly overshadowed by a high incidence of severe and unpredictable adverse effects during post-anesthetic emergence (Dove, 1984; Winter, 2020). These untoward effects, including delirium, agitation, and profound psychosis, led to its discontinuation for human use in the 1960s (Cohen, 1979; Winter, 2020). Subsequently, PCP found a niche as a veterinary anesthetic, but its ease of manufacture and potent psychotropic properties facilitated its diversion into the illicit drug market, where it became a prominent substance of abuse by the 1970s, known by street names such as "angel dust," "hog," and "PeaCe Pill" (Bey & Patel, 2007; Cohen, 1979; Dove, 1984).

Phencyclidine abuse is primarily a youthful activity, often consumed as part of a polydrug abuse pattern alongside substances like alcohol, sedatives, and marihuana (Cohen, 1979; Petsonk & McAlister, 1979). The drug can be administered through various routes, including inhalation (smoking), insufflation (snorting), ingestion, or injection, each influencing the onset and intensity of its effects (Bey & Patel, 2007; Dove, 1984). The clinical presentation of PCP intoxication is notoriously variable and dose-dependent, spanning a wide spectrum of pharmacological activity that includes psychotomimetic, anesthetic, sympathomimetic, anticholinergic, and dopaminergic effects (Castellani et al., 1982). This broad range of activity contributes to its reputation as one of the most potent and dangerous psychotomimetic compounds, capable of inducing a psychosis clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia (Garey, 1979; Høiseth et al., 2005).

From a biological perspective, Phencyclidine Use Disorder is rooted in the drug's profound and multifaceted interactions with key central nervous system (CNS) pathways. Its primary mechanism involves non-competitive antagonism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a critical component of the glutamatergic system that governs synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Høiseth et al., 2005). This action is shared with its derivative, ketamine, which is often studied as a pharmacological probe for understanding the effects of dissociative anesthetics (Mozayani, 2002; Meyers & Charles, 1978). Beyond the glutamatergic system, PCP exerts significant influence on dopaminergic pathways, which are central to reward, motivation, and the pathophysiology of psychosis (Castellani et al., 1982). This dual impact on glutamate and dopamine neurotransmission is thought to underlie its high abuse potential and its capacity to precipitate severe psychiatric decompensation (Dove, 1984; Garey, 1979).

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive academic overview of the biological and neurological basis of Phencyclidine Use Disorder, drawing exclusively from a defined set of research literature. It will explore the intricate neuropharmacology of PCP, detailing its effects on major neurotransmitter systems and cellular mechanisms. The chapter will also examine the functional consequences of PCP use on brain circuits, the biological underpinnings of its acute toxicity and chronic effects, and the pharmacological rationale for current and potential treatment strategies. Understanding these fundamental mechanisms is critical for clinicians managing the acute and chronic consequences of PCP use and for researchers striving to develop more effective interventions for this complex disorder.

## Neurobiological Systems

The profound and often unpredictable clinical effects of phencyclidine are a direct consequence of its complex interactions with multiple neurobiological systems. Unlike many other drugs of abuse that have a relatively selective primary target, PCP exhibits a broad range of pharmacological activity, engaging several key neurotransmitter pathways simultaneously (Castellani et al., 1982; Dove, 1984). This multifaceted action accounts for its unique combination of hallucinogenic, stimulant, and depressant properties, as well as its significant medical and psychiatric morbidity (Garey, 1979; Cohen, 1979).

### The Glutamatergic System and NMDA Receptor Antagonism

The principal neuropharmacological action of PCP is its role as a non-competitive antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor (Høiseth et al., 2005). Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, and NMDA receptors are crucial for synaptic plasticity, learning, and higher cognitive functions. By binding to a site within the NMDA receptor's ion channel (the "PCP binding site"), PCP blocks the influx of calcium ions, thereby inhibiting glutamatergic neurotransmission (Høiseth et al., 2005). This mechanism is shared with its derivative, ketamine, which is often used as a clinical and research model for PCP-like effects (Meyers & Charles, 1978; Mozayani, 2002).

The disruption of NMDA receptor function is believed to be the primary driver of PCP's hallmark dissociative and psychotomimetic effects (Høiseth et al., 2005; Rivera-Garcia & Cruz, 2023). This "dissociative anesthesia" is characterized by profound analgesia and amnesia without the complete loss of consciousness or significant cardiorespiratory depression seen with traditional anesthetics (Winter, 2020; Bey & Patel, 2007). The NMDA receptor hypofunction induced by PCP can elicit a clinical syndrome with positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms that are strikingly similar to those observed in schizophrenia (Høiseth et al., 2005; Garey, 1979). This observation has led to the development of the "glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia," which posits that dysregulation of the glutamatergic system may be a core pathophysiological feature of the disorder (Høiseth et al., 2005). The profound hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and disorganized thought processes frequently seen in PCP intoxication are considered direct functional consequences of this NMDA receptor blockade (Richards et al., 1979; Garey, 1979). The effects of related compounds, such as dextromethorphan (DXM), which can produce PCP-like psychological symptoms at high doses, further support the role of this mechanism in producing psychosis (Martinak et al., 2017).

### The Dopaminergic System

In addition to its effects on the glutamatergic system, PCP has significant dopaminergic activity (Castellani et al., 1982). This action is critical for understanding its abuse potential and its overlap with stimulant-induced psychosis. PCP has been shown to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine, leading to increased synaptic concentrations of this neurotransmitter, particularly within the mesolimbic pathway, which is central to the brain's reward system (Castellani et al., 1982; Svetlov et al., 2007). This mechanism is similar to that of other potent psychostimulants like cocaine and amphetamines (Svetlov et al., 2007; Mullen et al., 2019). The euphoria and feelings of omnipotence reported by users are likely mediated by this acute enhancement of dopaminergic transmission (Bey & Patel, 2007).

The dopaminergic action of PCP also contributes significantly to its psychosis-inducing effects (Castellani et al., 1982). The hyperdopaminergic state created by PCP is consistent with the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, which links positive psychotic symptoms to excessive dopamine activity (Mullen et al., 2019). The paranoia, agitation, and stereotyped movements seen in PCP intoxication are hallmarks of this dopaminergic overstimulation (Castellani et al., 1982; Cohen, 1979). This dual-hit mechanism—disrupting glutamate signaling while amplifying dopamine signaling—may explain why the psychosis induced by PCP can be so severe and, in some cases, prolonged (Richards et al., 1979; Garey, 1979). The use of dopamine antagonists like haloperidol has shown some success in managing the psychotic symptoms of PCP intoxication, providing clinical evidence for the involvement of this system (Castellani et al., 1982).

### Sympathomimetic and Anticholinergic Effects

PCP intoxication is frequently accompanied by a sympathomimetic toxidrome, characterized by hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and hyperthermia (Castellani et al., 1982; Bey & Patel, 2007). These effects are attributed to PCP's ability to inhibit the reuptake of catecholamines, including norepinephrine, similar to the action of amphetamines (Mullen et al., 2019; Castellani et al., 1982). This sympathomimetic surge can lead to significant medical morbidity, including cardiovascular crises and hyperthermic complications (Dove, 1984).

Furthermore, PCP possesses anticholinergic properties, which contribute to its clinical profile (Castellani et al., 1982). Anticholinergic effects can manifest as dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, and delirium (Castellani et al., 1982; Bostwick et al., 2012). The delirium, characterized by confusion, disorientation, and fluctuating levels of consciousness, can compound the underlying psychosis, making clinical assessment and management more challenging (Cohen, 1979). The successful use of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine to reverse some of the central and peripheral symptoms of PCP intoxication provides further support for the clinical relevance of its anticholinergic activity (Castellani et al., 1982; Jastak, 1985).

### Other Neurochemical and Cellular Mechanisms

The neurobiological impact of PCP extends beyond the major neurotransmitter systems. Research has indicated that PCP blocks potassium ion channels in brain tissue, a mechanism that could contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability and potentially lower the seizure threshold (Khansari et al., 1984). Seizures are a known complication of high-dose PCP intoxication, and this effect on ion channel function may be a contributing factor (Garey, 1979).

Additionally, specific binding sites for PCP have been identified on lymphocytes, and the drug has been shown to depress both humoral and cellular immune responses in vitro (Khansari et al., 1984). This finding of phencyclidine-induced immunodepression suggests that the drug's effects are not confined to the CNS and may have broader physiological consequences (Khansari et al., 1984). While the clinical significance of this immunomodulatory effect in the context of PCP Use Disorder is not fully understood, it highlights another layer of the drug's complex biological activity and raises questions about potential long-term health effects, such as increased susceptibility to infections (Khansari et al., 1984).

In summary, the neurobiology of Phencyclidine Use Disorder is characterized by a "pharmacological storm" affecting multiple critical brain systems. The primary antagonism of NMDA receptors drives the core dissociative and psychotomimetic experience, while concurrent potentiation of the dopamine system fuels its addictive properties and exacerbates psychosis. These central actions are coupled with significant sympathomimetic and anticholinergic effects that produce a dangerous and unpredictable state of physiological arousal and delirium.

## Genetic and Molecular Basis

The development of Phencyclidine Use Disorder, like other substance use disorders, is likely influenced by a complex interplay of environmental, behavioral, and biological factors. However, the specific genetic and molecular underpinnings that confer vulnerability to this disorder remain largely undefined within the provided body of research. The available literature does not contain studies investigating the heritability of PCP use disorder, candidate gene associations, or specific genetic polymorphisms that might predispose individuals to the adverse effects or rewarding properties of the drug. This represents a significant gap in the comprehensive biological understanding of the condition.

Despite the absence of genetic studies, it is possible to delineate the molecular basis of PCP's action by examining its known interactions with cellular components. The primary molecular target of PCP is the NMDA receptor complex (Høiseth et al., 2005). The drug binds with high affinity to a site located within the receptor's ion channel, physically obstructing the passage of ions and thereby acting as a potent channel blocker (Høiseth et al., 2005). This interaction is non-competitive with respect to glutamate, meaning PCP can block the channel even when the receptor is activated by its natural ligand. This specific molecular interaction is the foundation of PCP's profound effects on glutamatergic signaling and is a key distinction from other classes of hallucinogens which primarily target serotonin receptors (Rivera-Garcia & Cruz, 2023; Mahapatra & Gupta, 2016).

At the molecular level, PCP also interacts directly with dopamine transporters, inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine from the synaptic cleft (Castellani et al., 1982). This action increases the concentration and duration of dopamine signaling, a mechanism shared with highly addictive stimulants such as cocaine (Bravo et al., 2022). This molecular interaction provides a direct link between PCP use and the activation of the brain's reward pathways, which is fundamental to the development of addiction (Svetlov et al., 2007).

Further diversifying its molecular portfolio, PCP has been demonstrated to block potassium ion channels in brain tissue (Khansari et al., 1984). Ion channels are fundamental to regulating neuronal excitability, and the blockade of potassium channels can lead to a state of hyperexcitability, which may contribute to the risk of seizures observed in acute PCP intoxication (Garey, 1979).

An intriguing and unique molecular finding is the identification of specific PCP binding sites on lymphocytes (Khansari et al., 1984). This suggests a direct interaction between PCP and components of the immune system, which was subsequently supported by in vitro evidence of PCP-induced immunodepression (Khansari et al., 1984). The existence of such specific binding sites outside the CNS implies that PCP's biological effects may be more widespread than previously thought, although the functional role of these lymphocyte receptors and the clinical implications of this interaction in chronic users remain to be elucidated.

In essence, while the genetic architecture of vulnerability to Phencyclidine Use Disorder is not addressed in the available literature, the molecular basis of the drug's action is characterized by its high-affinity binding to several critical protein targets. Its function as an NMDA receptor channel blocker, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and a potassium channel blocker collectively forms the molecular foundation for its complex and dangerous psychoactive and physiological effects.

## Brain Structure and Function

Phencyclidine profoundly alters brain function, leading to a spectrum of effects ranging from euphoria and dissociation to severe psychosis and coma (Cohen, 1979; Garey, 1979). While the provided literature does not include structural or functional neuroimaging studies to visualize these changes anatomically, a great deal can be inferred about PCP's impact on brain function from its pharmacokinetics and the well-documented clinical neurology of intoxication.

### Pharmacokinetics and Brain Penetration

PCP's effects on the brain are heavily influenced by its physicochemical properties. It is a highly lipophilic (lipid-soluble) weak base, characteristics that facilitate its rapid transit across the blood-brain barrier (Bey & Patel, 2007). This property ensures a fast onset of central effects, particularly when the drug is inhaled or injected (Bey & Patel, 2007). Once in the CNS, the brain's high lipid content serves as a reservoir for the drug, leading to cerebral PCP concentrations that may be nine times higher than those in the serum (Bey & Patel, 2007).

This sequestration within the CNS, combined with a large volume of distribution throughout the body's adipose tissues, contributes to PCP's prolonged and often fluctuating clinical course (Bey & Patel, 2007). The drug has a long elimination half-life, estimated to be around three days, meaning its effects can persist for an extended period (Bey & Patel, 2007; Dove, 1984). This pharmacokinetic profile explains why patients can experience symptoms for hours or even days after a single dose and why chronic users may exhibit persistent psychiatric symptoms (Richards et al., 1979). Furthermore, PCP is actively secreted into the acidic environment of the stomach, where it becomes ionized and "trapped," only to be reabsorbed in the more alkaline small intestine (Bey & Patel, 2007). This process of ion trapping and enterohepatic recirculation can contribute to a prolonged or recurrent toxidrome, as illustrated in cases of massive overdose where drug-containing packets remain in the gastrointestinal tract for extended periods (Young & Crapo, 1992).

### Dose-Dependent Functional States

The functional state of the brain under the influence of PCP is highly dose-dependent (Cohen, 1979; Bey & Patel, 2007). At low doses (1-10 mg), users typically experience a state of stimulation, euphoria, and altered body image, consistent with the drug's dopaminergic and dissociative properties (Cohen, 1979; Castellani et al., 1982). Users may feel a sense of omnipotence, social prowess, and superhuman strength (Bey & Patel, 2007).

As the dose increases, the primary anesthetic and dissociative properties become more prominent. This leads to a state of profound analgesia, amnesia, and detachment from the environment (Winter, 2020). It was this "dissociative anesthesia" that was initially sought for surgical procedures (Dove, 1984). However, in a recreational context, this state is often accompanied by ataxia, dysarthria, and bizarre, stereotyped movements, reflecting widespread disruption of motor and sensory processing (Castellani et al., 1982; Cohen, 1979).

At high doses, PCP intoxication can lead to severe CNS depression, resulting in stupor, coma, seizures, and respiratory arrest (Garey, 1979; Young & Crapo, 1992). The progression to coma can be protracted, with serum drug levels remaining persistently elevated for weeks in cases of massive overdose, leading to prolonged periods of unresponsiveness until the drug is cleared (Young & Crapo, 1992).

### The Phencyclidine Psychosis

Perhaps the most dramatic functional consequence of PCP use is the induction of a psychotic state that is often clinically indistinguishable from acute schizophrenia (Garey, 1979; Høiseth et al., 2005). This is not merely a transient hallucinatory experience but can be a prolonged psychiatric syndrome characterized by paranoia, formal thought disorder, delusions, and both auditory and visual hallucinations (Richards et al., 1979; Castellani et al., 1982). The psychosis can be accompanied by extreme agitation, unpredictable hostility, and bizarre or violent behavior, making these patients a significant challenge in emergency and psychiatric settings (Cohen, 1979; Garey, 1979).

This functional brain state is thought to result from the synergistic disruption of glutamate and dopamine systems (Høiseth et al., 2005; Castellani et al., 1982). While the acute toxic psychosis typically resolves as the drug is eliminated, some individuals experience a protracted psychotic episode lasting for days or weeks after the last known use (Richards et al., 1979). It is hypothesized that chronic PCP use may kindle a persistent vulnerability to psychosis, or that the drug may trigger a latent psychotic disorder in predisposed individuals (Dove, 1984; Garey, 1979). The management of this state often requires hospitalization and supportive measures, as the benefit of psychotropic drugs can be questionable in the acute toxic phase (Richards et al., 1979).

In summary, PCP's unique pharmacokinetic properties allow it to rapidly enter and accumulate in the brain, leading to a prolonged and profound disruption of normal function. This disruption manifests as a dose-dependent continuum of altered functional states, from stimulation to dissociation, psychosis, and ultimately, life-threatening coma.

## Developmental Neurobiology

The impact of phencyclidine on the developing nervous system is a critical area of concern, particularly given that its abuse is primarily a youthful activity (Cohen, 1979; Petsonk & McAlister, 1979). The adolescent and young adult brain is undergoing significant maturational processes, including synaptic pruning and myelination, rendering it potentially more vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of substances that disrupt fundamental neurotransmitter systems. While the provided literature lacks direct studies on the developmental neurobiology of PCP in humans, valuable inferences can be drawn from research on its close pharmacological relative, ketamine, and from the clinical patterns of PCP use.

Ketamine, a phencyclidine derivative, shares the same primary mechanism of action as an NMDA receptor antagonist (Meyers & Charles, 1978; Bey & Patel, 2007). Research on the effects of perinatal ketamine exposure in animal models provides a crucial window into the potential developmental neurotoxicity of this class of drugs (Cheung & Yew, 2019). These studies raise concerns that exposure during critical periods of brain development could interfere with neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and apoptosis, potentially leading to long-term structural and functional deficits (Cheung & Yew, 2019). The NMDA receptor plays a pivotal role in activity-dependent brain development, and its blockade by drugs like PCP or ketamine during gestation or early life could have lasting consequences on neuronal circuitry and cognitive function (Cheung & Yew, 2019).

Clinical reports on ketamine use in children further highlight the unique vulnerabilities of the developing brain. Prolonged adverse reactions, including psychic disturbances and recurring hallucinations (or "flashbacks"), have been described in children following ketamine anesthesia (Meyers & Charles, 1978; Perel & Davidson, 1976). These phenomena, which are less commonly reported or have different characteristics in adults, suggest that the immature brain may process and respond to dissociative anesthetics differently, potentially leading to more persistent or severe psychiatric sequelae (Meyers & Charles, 1978, 1979).

The pattern of PCP abuse itself points to a developmental dimension. The drug became widely available and used among adolescents and young adults in the late 1960s and 1970s (Cohen, 1979; Dove, 1984). This demographic preference may be driven by psychosocial factors, but it also means that exposure is occurring during a sensitive neurodevelopmental window. The long-term consequences of initiating PCP use during adolescence are not well-defined in the provided literature, but it is plausible that chronic disruption of glutamatergic and dopaminergic systems during this period could alter the trajectory of brain maturation, potentially increasing the risk for later-life psychiatric disorders, including persistent psychosis or cognitive impairments (Dove, 1984; Garey, 1979).

Furthermore, the risk of unintentional exposure in very young children adds another layer of concern. Occult pediatric intoxication has been documented as a result of exposure to the smoke and even the butts of PCP-laced marijuana cigarettes (Bey & Patel, 2007). Such passive inhalation can lead to significant toxicity in infants and toddlers, whose developing brains and metabolic systems are ill-equipped to handle the drug (Bateman, 1989; Bateman & Heagarty, 1990). The clinical presentation in these cases can include neurological symptoms such as drowsiness, unsteady gait, and even seizures, highlighting the profound impact of PCP on the youngest and most vulnerable populations (Bateman, 1989; Bateman & Heagarty, 1990).

In conclusion, while direct research on the developmental neurobiology of PCP is absent from the provided sources, evidence from the closely related compound ketamine suggests significant risks. Exposure during perinatal and pediatric periods may induce neurotoxicity and lead to prolonged psychiatric symptoms. The prevalence of PCP abuse among adolescents occurs during a critical phase of brain maturation, raising concerns about long-term neurocognitive and psychiatric outcomes.

## Treatment Mechanisms

The management of Phencyclidine Use Disorder encompasses two distinct clinical challenges: the treatment of acute intoxication and the long-term management of dependence. The biological basis for therapeutic interventions is directly linked to PCP's complex pharmacology and pharmacokinetics. Given the drug's potent and multifaceted effects, treatment is often complex and remains largely supportive, as no specific antidote has been established for reversing all aspects of PCP toxicity (Garey, 1979; Bey & Patel, 2007).

### Management of Acute Intoxication

The primary goal in treating acute PCP intoxication is the support of vital functions and the prevention of harm to the patient and others (Cohen, 1979). Due to the high risk of agitation, violence, and self-injurious behavior, environmental management, such as placing the patient in a quiet, low-stimulus environment, is a crucial first step (Richards et al., 1979).

Pharmacological interventions are aimed at controlling specific symptoms. For severe agitation and psychosis, benzodiazepines are frequently used to provide sedation (Castellani et al., 1982). Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, enhance the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which can help to counteract the generalized CNS hyperexcitability induced by PCP (Bostwick et al., 2012; Drummer, 2002). In cases of severe, unmanageable psychosis, dopamine-blocking antipsychotic agents like haloperidol have been administered (Castellani et al., 1982). The rationale for using haloperidol stems from PCP's known dopaminergic activity; by blocking dopamine D2 receptors, haloperidol can mitigate the positive psychotic symptoms (Castellani et al., 1982; Nasrallah, 2013). However, the use of phenothiazine antipsychotics like chlorpromazine has been viewed with caution due to their potential to lower the seizure threshold and exacerbate anticholinergic effects (Castellani et al., 1982; Richards et al., 1979).

Given PCP's anticholinergic properties, interventions targeting the cholinergic system have been explored. The administration of physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases synaptic acetylcholine levels, has been shown to improve some symptoms of acute intoxication (Castellani et al., 1982). This provides a clear example of a treatment mechanism directly opposing one of the drug's neurochemical actions (Jastak, 1985; Savage & Metzger, 1978).

Another cornerstone of management is enhancing the elimination of the drug. Because PCP is a weak base, its excretion can be accelerated by acidifying the urine (Bey & Patel, 2007). This process, known as "ion trapping," involves administering agents like ammonium chloride or ascorbic acid to lower urinary pH. In an acidic environment, PCP becomes more ionized and less lipid-soluble, which reduces its reabsorption from the renal tubules back into the bloodstream, thereby promoting its clearance (Bey & Patel, 2007). This intervention is particularly relevant because of PCP's long half-life and tendency to accumulate in the body (Bey & Patel, 2007; Young & Crapo, 1992). For massive overdoses, continuous gastric suction may also be considered to remove the drug that is actively secreted into the stomach (Bey & Patel, 2007).

### Management of Dependence and Withdrawal

The provided literature focuses more on acute toxicity than on the long-term treatment of dependence. Chronic PCP use is known to lead to dependence, characterized by compulsive drug-seeking behavior and the emergence of severe depression with suicidal ideation upon cessation (Garey, 1979; Dove, 1984). However, a specific, well-defined withdrawal syndrome comparable to that of opioids or benzodiazepines is not consistently described. The management of PCP dependence primarily relies on psychosocial interventions and supportive care aimed at maintaining abstinence and addressing the profound psychiatric consequences, such as persistent depression or psychosis (Garey, 1979; Dove, 1984).

There are currently no specific pharmacotherapies approved for Phencyclidine Use Disorder. The treatment of co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, such as depression or anxiety that persist after detoxification, would typically involve standard psychotropic medications, though their efficacy in this specific population is not detailed in the provided sources (Garey, 1979). The management of PCP abuse is often part of a broader approach to polydrug use, as it is frequently consumed with other substances like cocaine, opioids, or benzodiazepines (Budd, 1981; Cohen, 1979). Therefore, a comprehensive treatment plan must address all co-used substances.

## Future Directions

The existing body of literature, as represented by the provided sources, offers a foundational understanding of the pharmacology and clinical toxicology of phencyclidine. It firmly establishes PCP's role as a potent NMDA receptor antagonist with significant dopaminergic, anticholinergic, and sympathomimetic properties (Castellani et al., 1982; Høiseth et al., 2005). However, a critical examination of these sources also reveals substantial gaps in knowledge, highlighting numerous avenues for future research that are essential for a complete biological and neurological picture of Phencyclidine Use Disorder.

One of the most striking omissions is the near-complete absence of research into the genetic and molecular basis of vulnerability. The provided papers do not address questions of heritability, candidate genes, or epigenetic modifications that might predispose individuals to initiating PCP use, developing dependence, or experiencing its most severe psychiatric sequelae. Future genetic association studies, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), are needed to identify potential risk alleles. Investigating genetic polymorphisms in the NMDA receptor subunits, dopamine transporters, or the enzymes responsible for PCP metabolism could provide critical insights into individual differences in drug response and toxicity.

Another major gap is the lack of neuroimaging research. The provided literature contains no studies utilizing techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or structural MRI to investigate the acute or chronic effects of PCP on the human brain. Such studies are vital to move beyond a purely functional description of PCP-induced psychosis. Future research should employ these methods to delineate the specific neural circuits disrupted by PCP. For instance, fMRI could clarify how NMDA antagonism alters functional connectivity within the default mode network or frontoparietal control networks, providing a neural correlate for the dissociative and psychotic experiences. PET imaging with specific radioligands could quantify changes in dopamine receptor density or glutamate transmission in chronic users, helping to elucidate the neurobiological basis of tolerance and dependence.

The long-term neurocognitive and psychiatric consequences of chronic PCP use are frequently mentioned but poorly characterized from a mechanistic standpoint (Garey, 1979; Dove, 1984). While clinical reports describe persistent depression and psychosis, prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to track cognitive domains such as executive function, memory, and attention over time in former users. Correlating these functional outcomes with structural brain changes (e.g., cortical thickness, white matter integrity) would help to determine the extent of PCP's potential neurotoxicity.

Furthermore, while the acute management of PCP intoxication is well-described, the development of targeted pharmacotherapies for Phencyclidine Use Disorder is an urgent priority. The current treatment paradigm is reactive and symptom-based (Cohen, 1979; Bey & Patel, 2007). Future research should focus on developing medications that can specifically modulate the glutamatergic or dopaminergic dysregulation caused by chronic PCP use to reduce craving and prevent relapse. Given the parallels with ketamine, which is being investigated for depression, there may be therapeutic potential in exploring compounds that modulate the glutamatergic system in novel ways to treat the anhedonia and depression associated with PCP cessation (Andrade, 2017; Whizar-Lugo et al., 2017).

Finally, the unique finding of specific PCP binding sites on lymphocytes and its immunomodulatory effects warrants further investigation (Khansari et al., 1984). The connection between the central nervous system and the immune system is an area of growing interest in psychiatry. Future studies could explore whether the immunodepressive effects of PCP contribute to the medical morbidity seen in chronic users or if this interaction has any bearing on the drug's psychiatric effects.

In conclusion, while the foundational pharmacology of PCP is established, the path forward requires a multidisciplinary research effort integrating genetics, advanced neuroimaging, cognitive neuroscience, and immunology to build a comprehensive, modern understanding of the biological basis of Phencyclidine Use Disorder.

## Conclusion

Phencyclidine Use Disorder is a condition defined by the profound and perilous effects of a drug with a uniquely complex neurobiological profile. Originally developed as a dissociative anesthetic, PCP's journey from a promising medical agent to a major drug of abuse is a direct reflection of its powerful and multifaceted pharmacology (Dove, 1984; Winter, 2020). The biological basis of this disorder is rooted in PCP's capacity to simultaneously disrupt multiple critical neurotransmitter systems, producing a clinical picture of unparalleled variability and severity (Castellani et al., 1982).

The core of PCP's action lies in its potent non-competitive antagonism of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, a mechanism that underpins its signature dissociative, analgesic, and psychotomimetic effects (Høiseth et al., 2005). The resulting state of NMDA receptor hypofunction provides a compelling pharmacological model for schizophrenia, capable of replicating the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of the endogenous psychosis (Garey, 1979). This primary action is critically compounded by PCP's potent inhibition of dopamine reuptake, which activates the brain's reward circuitry and contributes to its high abuse potential, while also exacerbating psychotic symptoms (Castellani et al., 1982). The convergence of glutamatergic disruption and dopaminergic hyperactivity creates a potent synergy that drives both the compulsive use and the severe psychiatric decompensation associated with the disorder.

This central mechanism is further augmented by the drug's sympathomimetic and anticholinergic properties, which manifest as a dangerous state of physiological hyperarousal and delirium, increasing medical risk (Castellani et al., 1982; Bey & Patel, 2007). The drug's pharmacokinetic profile, characterized by high lipophilicity and a long half-life, ensures prolonged and pervasive effects on brain function, contributing to the persistent and often fluctuating course of intoxication and psychosis (Bey & Patel, 2007; Young & Crapo, 1992).

Despite this foundational knowledge, the biological understanding of Phencyclidine Use Disorder is far from complete. The provided literature reveals a striking absence of modern neuroscientific inquiry, with no data on the genetic factors conferring vulnerability or the specific structural and functional brain changes associated with chronic use. The current understanding is built largely upon clinical toxicology, case reports, and foundational pharmacological studies from several decades ago (Cohen, 1979; Dove, 1984; Garey, 1979). While treatment strategies for acute intoxication are logically derived from PCP's known pharmacology—utilizing benzodiazepines for agitation, dopamine antagonists for psychosis, and urine acidification for elimination—there remains a clear and unmet need for targeted pharmacotherapies to treat the underlying addiction. As research into related compounds like ketamine continues to advance our understanding of the glutamatergic system in psychiatric illness (Andrade, 2017), it is imperative that this knowledge is applied to develop novel and effective interventions for the enduring challenge posed by phencyclidine.
