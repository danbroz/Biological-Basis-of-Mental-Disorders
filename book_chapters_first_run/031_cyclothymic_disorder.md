# Chapter 31: Cyclothymic Disorder

# The Biological and Neurological Basis of Cyclothymic Disorder

## Introduction

Cyclothymic disorder represents a chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance that occupies a critical space within the bipolar spectrum (Sharabyani, 2016; Chiaroni, 2005). Defined by numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode, the disorder must persist for at least two years (Alloy & Abramson, 2010). Unlike the more severe presentations of Bipolar I and Bipolar II disorders, which are characterized by discrete episodes of mania and major depression, cyclothymia is marked by a persistent instability of mood, with oscillations between depressive and hypomanic states that are subsyndromal in intensity and duration (Alloy & Abramson, 2010; Klein & Wender, 2005). Despite its classification as a "milder" form of bipolar illness, cyclothymia is associated with significant functional impairment and a heightened risk for developing full-blown Bipolar I or II disorder (Perugi, 2010; Brieger & Marneros, 1998).

From a biological and neurological perspective, cyclothymic disorder remains one of the least-studied affective conditions. The vast majority of neurobiological research has focused on the more severe poles of the mood spectrum, namely major depressive disorder (MDD) and Bipolar I disorder (BD-I) (Falkai et al., 2013). Consequently, our current understanding of the biological underpinnings of cyclothymia is largely inferential, extrapolated from the extensive body of work on related mood disorders. This chapter aims to synthesize this knowledge, constructing a neurobiological model of cyclothymia by drawing upon evidence from studies of bipolar disorder, depression, and other related psychiatric conditions. We will operate under the prevailing hypothesis that cyclothymia is not a distinct entity but rather a developmental stage or a persistent, sub-threshold expression of the same underlying neurobiological vulnerabilities that give rise to more severe bipolar illness (Akiskal, 1994; Erten, 2021).

This approach posits that the characteristic mood lability of cyclothymia (Alloy & Abramson, 2010) reflects a fundamental dysregulation in the neural circuits and neurotransmitter systems that govern emotional homeostasis. The subsyndromal depressive periods likely share pathophysiological mechanisms with major depression, including alterations in monoamine systems and stress-response pathways (Juruena, 2012; Anisman et al., 2005). Conversely, the hypomanic periods may represent a sub-threshold manifestation of the neurobiological state of mania, involving dopaminergic hyperactivity and dysregulation in reward-processing circuits (Belmaker, 2004; Dodd, 2007).

By examining the genetic and molecular basis of bipolar spectrum disorders, the structural and functional brain abnormalities identified through neuroimaging, and the neurodevelopmental trajectories that precede the onset of full-blown affective episodes, we can assemble a plausible, evidence-based portrait of the biology of cyclothymia. This chapter will explore these domains in detail, acknowledging the current limitations and controversies while highlighting the critical need for research focused specifically on this prevalent, yet understudied, condition. Understanding the biological basis of cyclothymia is not merely an academic exercise; it is crucial for improving early detection, refining diagnostic criteria, and developing targeted interventions to prevent the progression to more severe and debilitating forms of bipolar disorder (Miklowitz & Chang, 2008).

## Neurobiological Systems

The persistent mood instability that defines cyclothymic disorder (Alloy & Abramson, 2010) is widely believed to stem from fundamental dysregulation across multiple integrated neurobiological systems. While direct evidence from cyclothymic populations is scarce, a robust body of literature on bipolar disorder, depression, and related conditions provides a strong foundation for understanding the underlying pathophysiology (Falkai et al., 2013; Ghaemi, 2018). The core of this dysregulation appears to involve key neurotransmitter systems, the neuroendocrine stress-response axis, and disruptions in circadian biology.

### Neurotransmitter Systems and Neuropharmacology

The cycling between subsyndromal depressive and hypomanic states in cyclothymia suggests an imbalance in the primary monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems: serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) (Falkai et al., 2013; Willner, 1984). These systems are central to the regulation of mood, energy, motivation, and arousal, and are the primary targets of most psychopharmacological interventions for mood disorders (Janicak, 2014; Montgomery et al., 1993).

**Dopamine (DA):** The dopamine hypothesis, originally developed for schizophrenia, posits that an excess of dopamine activity is linked to psychotic symptoms (Dodd, 2007; Mauri, 2016). This framework has been extended to the manic phase of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by elevated mood, increased goal-directed activity, and sometimes psychotic features (Belmaker, 2004; Carlson & Pataki, 2014). The hypomanic periods in cyclothymia, involving euphoria, high energy, and impulsivity (Alloy & Abramson, 2010), likely represent a milder form of this dopaminergic hyperactivity. The efficacy of antipsychotic medications, which are dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, in treating mania supports this model (Dodd, 2007; Cookson, 2005). Conversely, drugs that stimulate dopamine release, such as amphetamines and cocaine, can cause psychotic and manic symptoms (Mauri, 2016; Cole & Katz, 1964). In cyclothymia, this may manifest as a heightened sensitivity to reward and increased novelty-seeking behavior, which has been linked to dopaminergic pathways in other disorders like Parkinson's disease with pathological gambling (Voon et al., 2007). The partial agonist activity of drugs like aripiprazole, which acts as a dopamine-serotonin system stabilizer, may be particularly relevant for the mood instability of cyclothymia, theoretically reducing dopaminergic tone during hypomanic states and increasing it during depressive states (Grover et al., 2006).

**Serotonin (5-HT) and Norepinephrine (NE):** The depressive phases of cyclothymia are thought to share neurobiological substrates with major depressive disorder, where deficits in serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission are strongly implicated (Anisman et al., 2005; Sahakian & Morein‐Zamir, 2011). The therapeutic action of most antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), is based on increasing the synaptic availability of these neurotransmitters (Montgomery et al., 1993; Juruena, 2012). Symptoms common in cyclothymic depression, such as low energy, anhedonia, and sleep disturbances (Alloy & Abramson, 2010), are consistent with dysfunction in these systems (Arbuck, 2022). However, the use of antidepressants in the bipolar spectrum, including cyclothymia, is complex. Antidepressant monotherapy can precipitate a "manic switch" or induce a state of chronic irritable dysphoria, suggesting that simply increasing serotonergic or noradrenergic tone can destabilize an already vulnerable system (Dias, 2010; Swann, 2009; Kora & Kaplan, 2008). This iatrogenic mood elevation underscores the delicate balance of monoamine systems in mood regulation and highlights the fundamental instability inherent in bipolar spectrum disorders.

**GABA and Glutamate:** Beyond the monoamines, the balance between inhibitory (gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA) and excitatory (glutamate) neurotransmission is critical for central nervous system homeostasis and is implicated in the pathophysiology of severe mental illnesses (Sommer & Arango, 2017). Perturbations in GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling have been linked to the pathophysiology of both catatonia and alcohol withdrawal, conditions which can involve extreme psychomotor agitation or retardation (Yarlagadda et al., 2007; Zutshi et al., 2007). This suggests that these systems may contribute to the psychomotor changes seen in both depressive (retardation) and hypomanic (agitation) states of cyclothymia (Alloy & Abramson, 2010). The efficacy of mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants like valproate and lamotrigine, which modulate GABAergic and glutamatergic activity, further supports the involvement of these systems in bipolar spectrum disorders (Erten, 2021; Tondo et al., 2005). This suggests that the mood cycling in cyclothymia may reflect an underlying instability in the brain's fundamental excitatory-inhibitory balance.

### Neuroendocrine and Circadian Systems

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the body's primary stress response system, is frequently dysregulated in mood disorders (Meyer & Hamel, 2014; Juruena, 2012). Chronic stress and adverse life events are potent triggers for depressive episodes (Goodyer et al., 2000; Harris, 1991). In depression, hyperactivity of the HPA axis, leading to elevated cortisol levels, is a common finding (Anisman et al., 2005; Loosen, 1994). This hypercortisolism can have neurotoxic effects, particularly on the hippocampus, and may contribute to the cognitive symptoms of depression (Sonino & Fava, 1998; Meyer & Hamel, 2014). The subsyndromal depressive periods in cyclothymia likely involve a similar, albeit potentially less severe, HPA axis dysregulation, contributing to symptoms of fatigue and anxiety (Alloy & Abramson, 2010).

Disruptions in circadian rhythms are a core feature of bipolar disorders (Falkai et al., 2013; Coca, 1994). Sleep disturbance, including both insomnia and hypersomnia, is a cardinal symptom of both depressive and hypomanic states in cyclothymia (Alloy & Abramson, 2010). This aligns with findings that sleep deprivation can have acute antidepressant effects but can also trigger hypomanic mood swings (Mauracher et al., 2024; Goetze & Tölle, 1981). The internal pacemaker, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, governs the 24-hour cycles of sleep, hormone release, and body temperature (Latta & Van Cauter, 2003). Dysregulation of this system, potentially influenced by genetic factors and environmental cues like light exposure, may contribute to the mood instability of cyclothymia (Zou et al., 2022). The link between seasonal changes and mood, as seen in Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which is often considered part of the bipolar spectrum, further highlights the importance of circadian biology in affective illness (Sher, 2003; Roecklin & Rohan, 2010).

## Genetic and Molecular Basis

Cyclothymic disorder is understood to be a highly heritable condition, existing within the broader genetic architecture of the bipolar spectrum (Sharabyani, 2016). While direct genetic studies of cyclothymia are rare, its strong clinical and familial link to Bipolar I and Bipolar II disorders allows for robust inferences to be drawn from the extensive genetic research on these more severe conditions (Erten, 2021; Mitchell et al., 2008). The prevailing model suggests that cyclothymia represents a phenotypic expression of a shared genetic liability, influenced by a complex interplay of multiple genes and environmental factors (Vonk, 2016).

### Heritability and Familial Aggregation

Family, twin, and adoption studies have consistently demonstrated that bipolar disorder (BD) is one of the most heritable psychiatric illnesses (Vonk, 2016; Marinković et al., 2001). First-degree relatives of individuals with BD-I have a significantly elevated risk of developing not only BD-I but also BD-II, major depression, and cyclothymia (Tondo et al., 2005; Cadoret & Winokur, 1972). The presence of a cyclothymic temperament is a recognized feature in relatives of bipolar patients and is considered a risk factor for developing a more severe mood disorder (Erten, 2021; Perugi, 2010). This familial aggregation strongly suggests a shared genetic vulnerability across the bipolar spectrum, with cyclothymia potentially representing a milder, sub-threshold manifestation of this liability (Brieger & Marneros, 1998). Twin studies further reinforce this, with monozygotic twins showing much higher concordance rates for BD than dizygotic twins, pointing to a substantial genetic component (Dodd, 2007). The heritability of BD is estimated to be as high as 60-85% (Vonk, 2016; Marinković et al., 2001).

### Candidate Genes and Molecular Pathways

The search for specific genes underlying bipolar spectrum disorders has been challenging, pointing towards a polygenic architecture where many genes of small effect contribute to overall risk (Stringer et al., 2015). Research has focused on genes involved in neurotransmitter regulation, neurodevelopment, and circadian rhythms.

**Neurotransmitter-Related Genes:** Given the central role of monoamines in mood regulation, genes related to dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine have been primary targets (Falkai et al., 2013). The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), particularly the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, has been extensively studied in depression and anxiety, with some evidence suggesting its involvement in BD (Marinković et al., 2001). Similarly, genes involved in dopamine metabolism, such as catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which degrades dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, have been investigated (Marinković et al., 2001). Variants in the COMT gene may influence cognitive function and emotional regulation, processes that are disrupted in cyclothymia (Sahakian & Morein‐Zamir, 2011).

**Neurodevelopmental and Synaptic Genes:** A growing body of evidence suggests that bipolar spectrum disorders, like schizophrenia, are neurodevelopmental in origin (Groisman & Seminatore, 2003; Remschmidt, 2008). This perspective has shifted focus towards genes involved in neuronal migration, synaptic plasticity, and brain maturation (Fernández-Egea & Jones, 2023). Genes such as *Neuregulin-1* (NRG1) and *Dystrobrevin binding protein 1* (DTNBP1), initially identified in schizophrenia research, are also considered candidates for BD, suggesting some shared genetic overlap between major psychotic disorders (Gao et al., 2023; Stringer et al., 2015). These genes play roles in processes like NMDA receptor signaling and synaptic development, which are fundamental to brain connectivity and function (Sommer & Arango, 2017).

**Circadian Rhythm Genes:** The profound disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms in bipolar disorder has led to investigation of "clock genes" (Zou et al., 2022). Genes such as *CLOCK*, *BMAL1*, and *PER3* form the core molecular machinery of the circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (Latta & Van Cauter, 2003). Polymorphisms in these genes have been associated with mood disorders, including BD, and may contribute to the vulnerability to sleep disruption and mood destabilization that is characteristic of cyclothymia (Zou et al., 2022; Coca, 1994).

### Gene-Environment Interactions

It is widely accepted that genetic predisposition alone is not sufficient to cause cyclothymia or other bipolar spectrum disorders; environmental factors play a crucial role in triggering the onset and influencing the course of the illness (Vonk, 2016). Stressful life events, particularly those involving personal loss or disappointment, are potent precipitants of depressive episodes (Goodyer et al., 2000; Harris, 1991). Childhood adversity, including abuse and neglect, is a significant risk factor for the development of mood disorders in adulthood, possibly through epigenetic mechanisms that alter the long-term expression of stress-related genes (Bouras & Lazaratou, 2012; Arnow, 2004). This interaction between a genetic diathesis and environmental stress is a cornerstone of modern psychiatric etiology and is highly relevant to cyclothymia, which often has its onset in adolescence or early adulthood, a period of significant psychosocial stress (Buitelaar, 2012; Akiskal, 1994). For instance, an individual with a genetic vulnerability in their HPA axis regulation might be more susceptible to developing the chronic mood instability of cyclothymia following early life trauma (Meyer & Hamel, 2014).

## Brain Structure and Function

While specific neuroimaging studies on cyclothymic disorder are sparse, a wealth of data from studies on Bipolar I and II disorders provides a strong basis for inferring the structural and functional neural correlates of the condition. These studies consistently point to abnormalities in brain regions and circuits crucial for emotion regulation, reward processing, and cognitive control, suggesting that cyclothymia represents a less severe manifestation of this same underlying neural circuit dysfunction (Dell’Osso et al., 2012).

### Structural Neuroimaging Findings

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in bipolar disorder have identified a range of subtle but consistent anatomical differences compared to healthy controls. One of the most replicated findings is ventricular enlargement, particularly of the third and lateral ventricles (Dell’Osso et al., 2012). This finding is not specific to bipolar disorder, as it is also one of the most consistent findings in schizophrenia (Dodd, 2007), suggesting it may be a general marker of neurodevelopmental abnormality in severe mental illness (Remschmidt, 2008).

Beyond ventricular changes, volumetric studies have implicated key nodes of the cortico-limbic circuitry. The limbic system, including the amygdala and hippocampus, is central to emotional processing and memory (Dell’Osso et al., 2012; Arbuck, 2022). Some studies have reported volumetric changes in these regions in bipolar patients, although findings have been inconsistent regarding the direction of these changes (e.g., increased or decreased volume). The prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly its medial and orbital subregions, is critical for top-down regulation of emotion and executive function (Lepping et al., 2015). Reductions in the size of the frontal lobe and other cortical grey matter regions have been reported in both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, potentially underlying deficits in cognitive control and emotional regulation (Dodd, 2007; Tamminga et al., 1998).

White matter abnormalities are also a prominent feature. These are often observed as hyperintensities on T2-weighted MRI scans, particularly in periventricular and deep subcortical white matter (Dell’Osso et al., 2012). These lesions may reflect disruptions in myelination or axonal integrity, impairing the connectivity and communication between distant brain regions. Such disruptions in the structural connectome could contribute to the poor integration of emotional and cognitive processing that characterizes mood dysregulation.

### Functional Neuroimaging and Neural Circuits

Functional neuroimaging techniques like functional MRI (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have provided crucial insights into the dynamic brain activity underlying mood states in bipolar disorder. A central model posits a dysregulation of the cortico-limbic circuit, involving a hyperactive ventral-limbic network and a hypoactive dorsal-cortical network (Ghaemi, 2018).

**The Ventral-Limbic Network:** This network, which includes the amygdala, insula, ventral striatum, and ventromedial PFC, is heavily involved in the identification of emotional stimuli and the generation of affective states (Arbuck, 2022). In bipolar disorder, hyperactivity in this network, particularly the amygdala, is often observed, especially during manic states and in response to emotional stimuli (Dell’Osso et al., 2012). This heightened limbic reactivity may underlie the emotional lability, irritability, and intense affective experiences that characterize both full manic episodes and the subsyndromal hypomanic periods of cyclothymia (Alloy & Abramson, 2010). PET studies have also implicated increased dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia, which is part of this network, in the pathophysiology of mania and psychosis (Dodd, 2007).

**The Dorsal-Cortical Network:** This network, encompassing the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and hippocampus, is essential for executive functions, cognitive control, and the top-down regulation of emotion (Frommann et al., 2010). In bipolar disorder, particularly during depressive states, hypoactivity in this network is frequently reported (Dell’Osso et al., 2012). This "hypofrontality" is also a key finding in schizophrenia (Dodd, 2007) and is thought to contribute to negative symptoms and cognitive deficits (Tamminga et al., 1998). In the context of cyclothymia, reduced activity in this regulatory network could impair the ability to dampen negative emotions and inhibit impulsive behaviors, contributing to both the depressive symptoms (e.g., poor concentration, indecisiveness) and the reckless behavior seen in hypomanic states (Alloy & Abramson, 2010; Sahakian & Morein‐Zamir, 2011).

The interplay between these two networks is crucial. The mood instability of cyclothymia can be conceptualized as a failure of the dorsal-cortical system to adequately regulate the hyper-reactive ventral-limbic system. This imbalance leads to swings between states of excessive negative affect (depression) and excessive positive or irritable affect (hypomania), without the ability to maintain a stable euthymic mood.

## Developmental Neurobiology

Cyclothymic disorder is fundamentally a condition of developmental significance, with its typical onset in adolescence or early adulthood and a course that often precedes the emergence of more severe bipolar disorders (Akiskal, 1994; Buitelaar, 2012). Understanding its biological basis therefore requires a developmental neurobiology perspective, which considers how genetic vulnerabilities and environmental factors interact across sensitive periods of brain maturation to shape the trajectory of affective illness (Miklowitz & Chang, 2008).

### Early Onset and Prodromal States

The onset of bipolar spectrum disorders frequently occurs during adolescence, a critical period of neurodevelopment involving synaptic pruning, myelination, and the maturation of fronto-limbic circuits responsible for emotional regulation (Janas–Kozik et al., 2025; Buitelaar, 2012). It is now recognized that a substantial proportion of adults with bipolar disorder report the onset of symptoms before the age of 18 (Faedda et al., 1995; Duffy, 2007). Cyclothymia, with its early onset and chronic, subsyndromal nature, can be conceptualized as a prodromal state or an early manifestation of this underlying vulnerability (Dias, 2010; Skjelstad et al., 2012).

Research into individuals at high clinical risk for psychosis has identified a prodromal phase characterized by non-specific symptoms such as anxiety, depression, social withdrawal, and sleep disturbances, often accompanied by a decline in functioning (Schultze‐Lutter, 2016; Triki et al., 2012; Yung, 2011). A similar trajectory is observed in the development of bipolar disorder, where early signs may include mood lability, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and disruptive behaviors (Miklowitz & Chang, 2008; Carlson & Pataki, 2016; Boylan & Eppel, 2008). Cyclothymic temperament, characterized by marked shifts in mood and energy, is a significant feature in youth who later develop bipolar disorder (Erten, 2021). These early, often non-specific, disturbances likely reflect the initial expression of neurodevelopmental abnormalities before the full syndrome crystallizes (Sommer & Arango, 2017). For instance, anxiety disorders such as OCD often anticipate the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence, suggesting they may be part of the same developmental continuum or early markers of risk (di Giacomo et al., 2023).
