# Chapter 12: The Biological and Neurological Basis of Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition

## Introduction

Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition occupies a unique and critical space at the interface of neurology, internal medicine, and psychiatry. Historically, a distinction was often drawn between "organic" conditions with a clear pathological basis and "functional" psychiatric disorders that lacked an obvious disease process (Isenberg & Garcia, 2008). This dichotomy obscured the profound reality that a wide array of systemic and neurological diseases can directly precipitate psychotic symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations (Silva et al., 2009; Leong et al., 2009). The nosological conventions of modern psychiatry, such as those in the DSM-5, now formally recognize syndromes where psychotic phenomena are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a non-psychiatric medical condition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, as referenced in Barnhill, 2014; Griswold et al., 2015). This diagnostic category moves beyond a simple correlation and posits a causal link, demanding a sophisticated understanding of the biological mechanisms through which somatic illness can disrupt the brain's capacity for reality testing (Hall et al., 1978; Isenberg & Garcia, 2008).

The presentation of psychosis secondary to a medical condition can be clinically heterogeneous, ranging from acute, florid psychotic episodes that mimic primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, to subtle or transient symptoms that complicate an existing medical picture (Isenberg & Garcia, 2008; Balaram et al., 2022). The underlying medical etiologies are vast, encompassing neurological disorders (e.g., traumatic brain injury, stroke, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases), endocrine dysfunctions (e.g., thyroid or adrenal disease), metabolic disturbances (e.g., hypoglycemia, porphyria), autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus), infections, and neoplasms (Schaffer & Donlon, 1983; Hall et al., 1978; Peterson & Martin, 1973). The challenge for the clinician is not merely to identify the presence of a medical condition but to establish its causal role in the genesis of the psychosis, a process that requires a thorough medical evaluation, careful history taking, and an appreciation for the complex interplay between brain and body (Sternberg, 1986; Anderson, 1980).

Historically, the failure to recognize an organic basis for psychosis often led to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment, with patients being labeled with primary psychiatric disorders while an underlying, and often treatable, medical illness went undetected (Lortie & Laird, 1957; Peterson & Martin, 1973). The recognition of physical illness presenting as psychiatric disease is therefore a cornerstone of modern neuropsychiatry (Hall et al., 1978). This chapter aims to synthesize the current understanding of the biological and neurological basis of Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition. It will explore the neurobiological final common pathways through which diverse medical pathologies can converge to produce the clinical syndrome of psychosis. We will examine the roles of neurotransmitter systems, specific brain regions and neural circuits, genetic vulnerabilities, and cellular mechanisms. Furthermore, we will review key findings from structural and functional neuroimaging that have helped elucidate the brain changes associated with this condition. By integrating knowledge from neurobiology, developmental science, and clinical neurology, this chapter will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how the disruption of somatic homeostasis can lead to a fundamental break with reality.

## Neurobiological Systems

The emergence of psychotic symptoms from a medical condition is not a random or inexplicable event but rather the consequence of the disruption of specific, vulnerable neurobiological systems. While the primary medical pathologies are diverse, they often converge upon a finite set of neural pathways and neurotransmitter systems that are crucial for maintaining integrated consciousness, perception, and reality testing (Engel, 1942; Isenberg & Garcia, 2008). The brain's high metabolic demand and exquisite sensitivity to physiological changes make it uniquely susceptible to systemic insults (Engel, 1942).

### Neurotransmitter Systems and Neuropharmacology

A central tenet in the neurobiology of psychosis is the dysregulation of key neurotransmitter systems, most notably dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Evidence from primary psychotic disorders provides a foundational model that is highly relevant to secondary psychoses (Tamminga & Ivleva, 2014).

**Dopaminergic Pathways:** The dopamine hypothesis, originally formulated for schizophrenia, remains a powerful explanatory model for psychotic symptoms regardless of etiology (Kane, 1996; Tamminga & Ivleva, 2014). Hyperactivity in mesolimbic dopamine pathways is strongly linked to the emergence of "positive" psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations (McKenna & Oh, 2001). Medical conditions can perturb this system through various means. For instance, traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause diffuse axonal injury that disrupts frontostriatal circuits, leading to dysregulated dopamine release (Sachdev, 2013). Similarly, substance-induced psychoses, particularly from stimulants like amphetamines and cocaine, provide a direct pharmacological model of dopamine-driven psychosis (Pitchot et al., 2013; Goldfeder et al., 2023). The efficacy of dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (antipsychotics) in treating psychosis, including that due to medical conditions, further supports the central role of this system (Monti et al., 2009; Jones, 1962). Conditions affecting the basal ganglia, such as Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease, can also be associated with psychosis, often as a complication of dopaminergic treatments, highlighting the delicate balance of this system (Aarsland & Larsen, 2003; Chatterjee & Marder, 2004).

**Serotonergic and Noradrenergic Systems:** Serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) systems, primarily known for their role in mood and anxiety, are also critically implicated in psychosis (Baldwin et al., 2002). These systems have widespread projections throughout the cortex and limbic system, modulating everything from arousal and attention to mood and perception (Claes, 2009). The psychotomimetic effects of serotonergic hallucinogens like LSD demonstrate the capacity of this system to generate profound perceptual distortions and psychotic experiences (Iversen et al., 2009; Cole & Katz, 1964). Medical conditions that induce significant stress, such as major surgery, severe illness, or trauma, trigger massive releases of stress hormones and neurotransmitters, including NE, which can contribute to states of hyperarousal and agitation that form the substrate of delirium and psychosis (Davidson & Baum, 1994; Hellhammer & Wade, 1993). Furthermore, the frequent comorbidity of depression and anxiety with medical illness suggests a shared neurobiological vulnerability; dysregulation in serotonin and norepinephrine pathways may not only produce mood symptoms but also lower the threshold for psychosis (Baldwin et al., 2002; Greden, 2003). The efficacy of certain atypical antipsychotics, which have potent effects on serotonin receptors, underscores the interactive nature of these systems in psychosis (Montes & Rey, 2009).

**Glutamatergic and GABAergic Systems:** Glutamate, the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), its primary inhibitory counterpart, are fundamental to maintaining cortical stability. The glutamate hypothesis of psychosis posits that hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is a key pathophysiological event (Müller-Spahn & Eich, 1996). This is powerfully illustrated by the psychotic symptoms induced by NMDA antagonists like phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine. Medical conditions such as encephalitis (particularly autoimmune anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis) provide a direct model of glutamate dysregulation leading to severe psychosis and catatonia (Bitnun & Richardson, 2015). Similarly, metabolic encephalopathies, hypoxia, and certain toxic exposures can disrupt the delicate balance of glutamate and GABA, leading to neuronal hyperexcitability, seizures, and psychosis (Lothman, 1990; Engel, 1942). Epilepsy itself, particularly temporal lobe epilepsy, has a well-documented association with interictal and postictal psychosis, believed to stem from chronic alterations in limbic excitability and neurotransmitter function (Clark & Lesko, 1939; Engel et al., 1986; Perrine, 1991).

### Brain Regions, Neural Circuits, and Functional Connectivity

Psychosis arises not from the dysfunction of a single brain region, but from the disruption of large-scale neural circuits that integrate sensory information, emotion, and cognition. Key networks implicated include frontotemporal, limbic, and subcortical circuits.

**Frontotemporal Circuits:** The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and temporal lobes are central to executive function, social cognition, and reality monitoring. Lesions or dysfunction in these areas are strongly associated with psychosis. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), for example, frequently presents with behavioral changes and psychosis due to focal degeneration in these regions (Honig et al., 2003). Traumatic brain injury often involves contusions to the frontal and temporal poles, leading to disinhibition, personality change, and posttraumatic psychosis (Sachdev, 2013; Fries, 2013; Hainline et al., 2019). Similarly, strokes affecting these cortical areas can manifest with psychotic symptoms (Beckson & Cummings, 1991). Functional disruption of these circuits, as seen in delirium, impairs the brain's ability to direct attention and integrate information, resulting in confusion, disorientation, and psychotic misperceptions (Isenberg & Garcia, 2008; Romano, 1944).

**Limbic System:** The limbic system, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus, is the brain's emotional core and is vital for memory formation and threat processing. Dysfunction in this network is a cornerstone of many neuropsychiatric conditions. Temporal lobe epilepsy, with its focus in or near limbic structures, is a classic example of a neurological condition precipitating psychosis (Clark & Lesko, 1939; Pincus & Tucker, 2002; Ristić et al., 2004). The intense emotional and experiential phenomena (auras) associated with temporal lobe seizures, such as fear, depersonalization, or mystical experiences, highlight the role of these structures in subjective reality (Saver & Rabin, 1997; Hobson, 1988). Herpes encephalitis, which has a predilection for the temporal lobes, is another potent cause of psychosis secondary to limbic damage (Uğurlu et al., 2020). Moreover, psychological trauma and severe stress, which are potent triggers for both primary and secondary psychosis, exert their effects via profound and lasting changes in limbic circuitry, particularly in amygdala-prefrontal connectivity (Hoon, 2012; Bob, 2008).

**Subcortical Structures (Basal Ganglia and Thalamus):** The basal ganglia and thalamus act as critical relay and integration centers, gating the flow of information to the cortex. The thalamus, in particular, is a sensory filter, and its dysfunction can lead to a failure to properly gate sensory input, potentially resulting in perceptual distortions and hallucinations (Müller-Spahn & Eich, 1996). Lesions in the thalamus due to stroke or tumor have been reported to cause psychosis (Pee et al., 2001). The basal ganglia are implicated via their role in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops. Diseases affecting these structures, such as Huntington's disease, Wilson's disease, or Fahr's disease, are all associated with high rates of psychosis, suggesting that disruption of these motor and cognitive loops contributes to a psychotic phenotype (Chatterjee & Marder, 2004; Sher et al., 2013).

**Functional Connectivity:** Modern neuroscience increasingly views brain function in terms of the coordinated activity of distributed networks. Psychosis due to a medical condition can be conceptualized as a "disconnection syndrome," where the underlying pathology disrupts the communication and functional integration between key brain regions (Hoon, 2012). This could manifest as a failure of top-down control from the PFC over limbic structures, leading to emotional dysregulation and misattribution of salience, or as a breakdown in the integration of sensory information, leading to hallucinations (Anderson, 2007; Sass, 2022). The fluctuating nature of psychosis in many medical conditions, especially delirium, may reflect a dynamic instability in these large-scale networks, where the brain's ability to maintain a coherent state of consciousness is intermittently compromised (Romano, 1944; Albin & Kimchi, 2024).

## Genetic and Molecular Basis

While Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition is, by definition, caused by a somatic illness, the development of psychosis is not an inevitable consequence for every individual with that illness. This variability in presentation points to a complex interplay between the medical insult and pre-existing vulnerabilities, including genetic and molecular factors that modulate an individual's risk (Sachdev, 2013; Hainline et al., 2019).

### Genetic Factors and Heritability

The role of genetics in primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is well-established, with high heritability estimates (Munro, 1938; Winokur, 1970). In the context of secondary psychosis, genetics likely plays a more nuanced role, primarily by conferring a diathesis or vulnerability that is "unmasked" by the physiological stress of a medical condition (Hainline et al., 2019). An individual may carry a sub-threshold genetic load for a primary psychotic disorder which remains clinically silent until a significant biological stressor—such as a traumatic brain injury, stroke, or severe systemic infection—destabilizes cerebral homeostasis and pushes them across the threshold into overt psychosis (Sachdev, 2013; Abe, 1981).

Evidence for this model comes from several lines of inquiry. Family history of a primary psychiatric illness is a recognized risk factor for developing psychosis in the context of neurological conditions like epilepsy and TBI (Vercelletto, 1972; Sachdev, 2013). This suggests that shared genetic factors may predispose individuals to both cerebral instability (e.g., a lower seizure threshold) and a greater likelihood of psychotic decompensation when the brain is injured (Engel et al., 1986). While specific genes for psychosis due to a medical condition have not been identified, it is plausible that polymorphisms in genes related to dopamine regulation, glutamate transmission, neurodevelopment, and synaptic plasticity—all implicated in schizophrenia—also contribute to this vulnerability (Mizuno et al., 2019; Aguilar‐Valles, 2011). For example, a variation in the COMT gene, which affects dopamine metabolism in the prefrontal cortex, could render an individual more susceptible to psychotic symptoms following a head injury that compromises frontal lobe function (Sachdev, 2013).

### Molecular Mechanisms and Pathways

The molecular cascades that translate a systemic medical disease into a central nervous system (CNS) psychosis are complex and multifactorial. Key pathways include neuroinflammation, metabolic and endocrine disruption, and the cellular stress response.

**Neuroinflammation:** A growing body of evidence implicates inflammation as a critical pathway in the pathogenesis of psychiatric symptoms, including psychosis (Chin, 2020). Systemic medical conditions such as infections, autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus), and even major physical trauma can trigger a robust systemic inflammatory response (Hall et al., 1978; Peterson & Martin, 1973). Pro-inflammatory cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier or signal through it, activating microglia and astrocytes within the CNS. This neuroinflammatory state can alter neurotransmitter metabolism, for example by shunting tryptophan away from serotonin synthesis and toward the production of neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites (Bersani et al., 2019). It can also lead to increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired synaptic plasticity, all of which contribute to neuronal dysfunction and could precipitate psychosis (Chin, 2020; Anisman & Hayley, 2012). Autoimmune encephalitides, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, provide a direct model where an immune attack on neuronal receptors produces a severe neuropsychiatric syndrome often dominated by psychosis (Uğurlu et al., 2020).

**Metabolic and Endocrine Disruption:** The brain is highly dependent on a stable metabolic environment, and disruptions can have profound neuropsychiatric consequences (Engel, 1942). Conditions like hypoglycemia, porphyria, hepatic encephalopathy, and uremia can lead to an accumulation of toxins or a deficit of essential substrates, directly impairing neuronal function and leading to delirium and psychosis (Lortie & Laird, 1957; Cross, 1956; Shang, 2014). Endocrine disorders are another major cause of secondary psychosis (Schaffer & Donlon, 1983). Thyrotoxicosis, for instance, can present as mania or psychosis, likely due to the widespread effects of excess thyroid hormone on catecholamine systems and neuronal excitability (Portnoi, 1979; Weisz, 2024). Similarly, Cushing's syndrome, characterized by excess cortisol, is strongly associated with depression and psychosis, highlighting the potent effects of glucocorticoids on the brain, particularly on limbic and prefrontal structures (Schlezinger & Horwitz, 1940). The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the body's central stress response system, is a key mediator. The chronic stress of a severe medical illness can lead to sustained HPA axis dysregulation, which has been linked to both depression and psychosis, possibly through its effects on hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (Hellhammer & Wade, 1993; Claes, 2009).

**Cellular and Synaptic Mechanisms:** At the cellular level, the final common pathway often involves excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and impaired synaptic function (Lothman, 1990). In conditions like stroke or TBI, the primary injury triggers a secondary cascade of events including massive glutamate release, calcium influx, and the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to neuronal death and synaptic loss (Ren, 2008; Sachdev, 2013). This loss of synaptic integrity and disruption of local circuits can de-afferent cortical regions or disrupt the balance of excitation and inhibition, creating a substrate for psychotic phenomena (Mizuno et al., 2019). In neurodegenerative diseases like dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's disease, the accumulation of pathological proteins (e.g., alpha-synuclein) directly causes synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss in critical circuits, leading to the high prevalence of visual hallucinations and delusions seen in these disorders (Aarsland & Larsen, 2003; Candela et al., 2013). Ultimately, the specific medical condition acts as a biological stressor that compromises the brain's resilience, leading to a breakdown in the cellular and synaptic processes that underpin normal thought and perception.

## Brain Structure and Function

The link between specific medical conditions and psychosis is fundamentally rooted in the alteration of brain structure and function. Advances in neuroimaging have been pivotal in moving beyond a purely descriptive classification towards a mechanistic understanding, allowing researchers and clinicians to visualize the cerebral consequences of systemic disease (Hall et al., 1978; Griswold et al., 2015).

### Neuroimaging Findings: Structural

Structural neuroimaging techniques, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), have been instrumental in identifying gross and subtle brain abnormalities that underlie psychosis in the context of another medical condition (Opjordsmoen, 1991). The findings are often heterogeneous, reflecting the diversity of underlying pathologies, but they consistently point toward the disruption of key neural networks (Sachdev, 2013).

**Focal Lesions:** One of the most direct lines of evidence comes from cases where discrete focal lesions from stroke, tumor, or trauma precipitate psychosis (Beckson & Cummings, 1991; Sachdev, 2013). The location of these lesions is non-random. Lesions in the temporal lobes, particularly involving limbic structures like the hippocampus and amygdala, are frequently implicated (Starkstein & Robinson, 1989; Robinson, 2000). This is consistent with the high rates of psychosis in temporal lobe epilepsy and herpes encephalitis, which preferentially affect these regions (Clark & Lesko, 1939; Uğurlu et al., 2020). Frontal lobe lesions are also strongly associated with psychosis, often presenting with disinhibition, personality change, and impaired judgment alongside delusions or hallucinations (Fries, 2013; Honig et al., 2003). Strokes or tumors affecting subcortical structures, such as the thalamus or basal ganglia, can also induce psychosis by disrupting critical cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical feedback loops (Pee et al., 2001; Robinson, 2000). For example, a case of auditory hallucinations was linked to an occipital infarct, suggesting a complex disruption of sensory processing networks (Ido et al., 2018).

**Diffuse and Atrophic Changes:** Not all structural changes are focal. Many medical conditions lead to more diffuse brain pathology. Traumatic brain injury (TBI), for instance, can cause diffuse axonal injury, which is not always visible on conventional MRI but results in widespread disconnection between brain regions (Sachdev, 2013; Arciniegas et al., 2005). Over time, TBI can also lead to generalized or focal cortical atrophy, which correlates with the emergence of chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms, including psychosis (Sachdev, 2013). In neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal dementia, progressive cortical atrophy is the hallmark of the disease and directly correlates with the development of cognitive and psychotic symptoms (Geldmacher & Whitehouse, 1996; Honig et al., 2003). Similarly, subcortical atrophy and white matter changes, often related to chronic vascular disease, have been linked to late-life depression and psychosis, supporting a "vascular depression" and "vascular psychosis" hypothesis (Starkstein & Robinson, 1989; Robinson, 2000).

**Developmental and Congenital Abnormalities:** In some cases, the structural abnormality is not acquired in adulthood but is developmental in origin. Conditions like 22q11 deletion syndrome involve congenital brain malformations and carry an extremely high risk for psychosis, providing a powerful model for how neurodevelopmental abnormalities create a vulnerable substrate (Demily et al
