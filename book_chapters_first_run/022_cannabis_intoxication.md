# Chapter X: The Biological and Neurological Basis of Cannabis Intoxication

## Introduction

Cannabis intoxication is a transient psychoactive state resulting from the consumption of cannabis or its constituent cannabinoids, primarily delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (Pytell & Rastegar, 2025; Hoch et al., 2024). As the most commonly used illicit substance globally, its effects on the central nervous system (CNS) are of profound interest to neuroscience and clinical psychiatry (Karila et al., 2014; Hoch et al., 2024). The experience of intoxication is multifaceted, encompassing a spectrum of psychological and physiological changes that include euphoria, relaxation, altered sensory perception, cognitive impairment, and, in some cases, anxiety, paranoia, and psychosis (Hollister, 1971; Karila et al., 2014; Schoedel & Harrison, 2012). These phenomena, which in a non-intoxicated state might be considered psychiatric symptoms, are the direct consequence of THC's interaction with the brain's endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) (Thomas, 1993; Pearlson, 2020).

From a biological perspective, cannabis intoxication is not a monolithic event but rather a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome driven by dose-dependent neuropharmacological actions (Hollister, 1971; Tassinari et al., 1999). The intensity and character of the intoxication are shaped by the potency of the cannabis product (i.e., THC concentration), the ratio of THC to other cannabinoids like cannabidiol (CBD), the route of administration, and the user's individual neurobiology, expectations, and environment (Schoedel & Harrison, 2012; Niesink & van Laar, 2013). While often sought for its hedonic effects, acute intoxication can precipitate a range of adverse outcomes, including panic attacks, motor vehicle accidents, and acute psychotic episodes, particularly in naive users or with high-potency products (Karila et al., 2014; Hoch et al., 2024; Thornicroft, 1990).

Understanding the biological underpinnings of cannabis intoxication is critical for several reasons. It illuminates the mechanisms by which cannabis exerts its therapeutic effects, clarifies the pathophysiology of its adverse psychiatric consequences, and informs the development of treatments for cannabis use disorder (CUD) and its complications (Araos et al., 2014; Bonnet & Preuss, 2017). Chronic use leads to neuroadaptive changes that underpin tolerance, dependence, and a well-characterized withdrawal syndrome, further highlighting the profound and persistent impact of cannabinoids on brain function (Ramesh et al., 2011; Jones et al., 1981). This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the biological and neurological mechanisms of cannabis intoxication, synthesizing evidence from neuropharmacology, neuroimaging, genetics, and clinical science to construct a detailed model of how this ancient plant alters consciousness, cognition, and behavior.

## Neurobiological Systems

The psychoactive effects of cannabis are mediated primarily through the interaction of THC with the endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS), a ubiquitous neuromodulatory system that plays a crucial role in regulating a vast array of physiological and cognitive processes (Araos et al., 2014; Potvin et al., 2004). The ECS comprises cannabinoid receptors, their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids), and the enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation. THC's ability to hijack this system disrupts homeostatic balance across multiple neurotransmitter networks, giving rise to the complex phenotype of intoxication (Bulacia, 2016; Rivera-Olmos & Parra-Bernal, 2016).

### Neurotransmitter Systems and Neuropharmacology

**The Endocannabinoid System (ECS):** The primary molecular target for THC is the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor that is among the most abundant in the mammalian brain (Skolnick & Crystal, 2019; Dervaux, 2013). CB1 receptors are densely expressed in brain regions critical for the functions that cannabis intoxication affects, including the hippocampus (memory), prefrontal cortex (executive function, judgment), amygdala (emotion, anxiety), basal ganglia and cerebellum (motor control), and nucleus accumbens (reward and motivation) (Dervaux, 2013; Pearlson, 2020; Ashton, 2018).

CB1 receptors are primarily located on presynaptic terminals, where they function as retrograde messengers (Araos et al., 2014). When a postsynaptic neuron is strongly activated, it releases endocannabinoids (like anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol) that travel backward across the synapse to bind to presynaptic CB1 receptors (Potvin et al., 2004; Musty, 2007). This binding inhibits the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate (excitatory) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (inhibitory), thereby modulating synaptic transmission (Yarlagadda et al., 2007; Antonio & Alfredo, 2012). THC acts as a partial agonist at CB1 receptors, mimicking the action of endocannabinoids but with greater potency and duration, leading to a widespread suppression of neurotransmitter release across the brain (D'Souza, 2023; Skolnick & Crystal, 2019). This disruption of finely tuned synaptic modulation is the foundational mechanism of intoxication. Cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptors are found predominantly in the immune system but are also present in the CNS, particularly on microglia, where they may play a role in neuroinflammation (Vega-García et al., 2021).

**Dopamine System:** The euphoric and reinforcing effects of cannabis are strongly linked to its interaction with the mesolimbic dopamine system, the brain's primary reward circuit (Roques, 2000; Franken & Wiers, 2013). THC increases dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, a key mechanism shared by most drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamines, and opioids (Snyder, 2019; Antonio & Alfredo, 2012; Roberts & Koob, 1997). This is thought to occur via a disinhibition mechanism: THC binds to CB1 receptors on GABAergic interneurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), suppressing GABA release. This, in turn, disinhibits (i.e., activates) the VTA dopamine neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens, leading to increased dopamine firing and the experience of pleasure and reward (D'Souza, 2023; Beninger, 2018). This dopaminergic surge contributes to the "high" and motivates continued drug use (Musty, 2007; Franken & Wiers, 2013).

Conversely, alterations in dopamine signaling are central to the pathophysiology of psychosis (Dodd, 2007). The ability of cannabis to induce psychotic symptoms, such as paranoia and hallucinations, is hypothesized to be mediated by this same dopaminergic hyperactivity, particularly in genetically vulnerable individuals (Radhakrishnan et al., 2014; Hall & Degenhardt, 2010; D'Souza, 2023). Chronic cannabis use may lead to a blunting of the dopamine system, contributing to the amotivational syndrome and anhedonia seen in some heavy users (Hall, 2012; Schmits & Quertemont, 2013).

**Glutamate and GABA Systems:** As a retrograde signaling system, the ECS is a primary regulator of both excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmission (Antonio & Alfredo, 2012; Becker & Redmond, 2002). THC's widespread activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors leads to a general suppression of both glutamate and GABA release (Yarlagadda et al., 2007). This disruption of the delicate balance between excitation and inhibition likely underlies many of the cognitive and perceptual effects of intoxication (Sewell et al., 2010). For instance, impaired glutamate signaling in the hippocampus is a key mechanism for THC-induced deficits in learning and memory (Torres & Fiestas, 2014; Ashton, 2018). Similarly, altered GABAergic function in the amygdala may contribute to both the anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects of cannabis, depending on dose and context (Musty, 2007). Chronic exposure to THC induces neuroadaptations in these systems, with evidence pointing to a state of glutamatergic hyperexcitability during withdrawal, contributing to symptoms like irritability and anxiety (Becker & Redmond, 2002; Bonnet & Preuss, 2017).

**Serotonin and Other Neurotransmitters:** The ECS also interacts with other key neurotransmitter systems. There is evidence of cross-talk between the cannabinoid and serotonin (5-HT) systems, particularly involving 5-HT2A receptors, which are implicated in the effects of classic hallucinogens like LSD (Sewell et al., 2010; Iversen et al., 2009). This interaction may contribute to the perceptual alterations and mood changes seen during cannabis intoxication (Hollister, 1971; D'Souza, 2023). Furthermore, the ECS modulates the release of acetylcholine, which is critical for attention and memory, and norepinephrine, which is involved in arousal and stress responses (Watanabe & Yamamoto, 1992; D'Souza, 2023). The broad, modulatory nature of THC's action across these multiple systems explains the highly variable and complex clinical presentation of cannabis intoxication (Karila et al., 2014; Ashton, 2018).

### Cellular and Synaptic Mechanisms

At the cellular level, THC's binding to the CB1 receptor initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events. As a G-protein coupled receptor, CB1 activation inhibits adenylyl cyclase, reduces cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, and modulates several ion channels (Antonio & Alfredo, 2012; D'Souza, 2023). This includes the inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels and the activation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels, which collectively hyperpolarize the presynaptic terminal and reduce the probability of neurotransmitter vesicle fusion and release (Potvin et al., 2004). This is the fundamental synaptic mechanism for THC's widespread suppression of neural communication.

Chronic cannabis use leads to significant neuroplastic changes. The most well-documented is the desensitization and downregulation of CB1 receptors in multiple brain regions (Bonnet & Preuss, 2017; Ramesh et al., 2011). This homeostatic adaptation is a key mechanism of tolerance, where progressively higher doses of THC are required to achieve the same psychoactive effect (Jones et al., 1981; Compton et al., 1990). When cannabis use is ceased, the brain is left in a state of reduced endocannabinoid signaling tone due to the downregulated receptors. This hypofunction of the ECS is thought to be a primary driver of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome, which includes symptoms like irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and decreased appetite (Connor et al., 2021; Bonnet & Preuss, 2017). The recovery of CB1 receptor density to normal levels can take up to four weeks of abstinence, a timeline that parallels the typical duration of withdrawal symptoms (Bonnet & Preuss, 2017; Van Gerven Jm et al., 1998).

Beyond receptor density, chronic cannabis exposure may induce long-term neuroplastic changes in synaptic structure and function, particularly in regions like the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (Araos et al., 2014; Hyytiä, 2015). These enduring alterations could underlie the persistent cognitive deficits and increased psychiatric risk associated with heavy, long-term use, especially when initiated during the critical neurodevelopmental period of adolescence (Ashton, 2018; Hall, 2012).

## Genetic and Molecular Basis

The response to cannabis intoxication and the risk for developing CUD and its psychiatric sequelae are not uniform across individuals. A growing body of evidence indicates that genetic factors play a significant role in modulating both the acute effects of cannabis and the long-term outcomes of its use (Ashton, 2018; D'Souza, 2023). Heritability estimates for CUD are substantial, suggesting a strong genetic component to addiction liability.

### Heritability and Candidate Genes

Twin studies have provided evidence for the heritability of cannabis use patterns and CUD (Dodd, 2007). This genetic predisposition likely involves multiple genes that influence neurotransmitter systems, drug metabolism, and personality traits like impulsivity and novelty-seeking (Bari et al., 2010; George & Koob, 2017).

Of particular interest is the interaction between cannabis use and genetic risk for schizophrenia. Large-scale epidemiological studies have consistently shown that cannabis use, particularly during adolescence, increases the risk of developing schizophrenia, but primarily in individuals with a pre-existing genetic vulnerability (Radhakrishnan et al., 2014; Hall & Degenhardt, 2010; Heekeren, 2011). This suggests a gene-by-environment interaction, where cannabis acts as an environmental trigger in genetically predisposed individuals (Häfner, 2005; Zammit et al., 2011).

Several candidate genes have been implicated in this interaction. Polymorphisms in the gene for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that degrades dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, have been studied extensively. The Val158Met polymorphism, which affects enzyme activity, appears to moderate the risk of psychosis following adolescent cannabis use (Radhakrishnan et al., 2014). Similarly, variants in the *AKT1* gene, which is involved in dopamine signaling, have also been shown to interact with cannabis use to predict psychosis risk (Radhakrishnan et al., 2014; D'Souza, 2023). Other potential genes of interest are those coding for components of the ECS itself, such as the CB1 receptor (*CNR1*) and the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which degrades anandamide (D'Souza, 2023).

### Molecular Mechanisms

At the molecular level, intoxication is the result of THC's direct action on CB1 receptors, leading to downstream effects on intracellular signaling pathways, including the cAMP and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (Antonio & Alfredo, 2012). These pathways are integral to regulating gene expression and synaptic plasticity. Chronic drug exposure can lead to persistent changes in gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modification (Kalivas et al., 2003). These epigenetic changes may represent a molecular "memory" of drug exposure that contributes to the long-lasting neuroadaptations underlying addiction and vulnerability to relapse (Kalivas et al., 2003; George & Koob, 2017).

The molecular mechanisms of cannabis withdrawal are also an active area of research. The syndrome is characterized by a negative emotional state driven by a "stress surfeit" in the brain, involving hyperactivity of stress systems like the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system in the extended amygdala (Koob, 2020; Koob, 2013). This stress system activation, coupled with the "reward deficit" from a hypo-functioning dopamine system, creates a powerful negative reinforcement state that motivates relapse to alleviate the aversive symptoms of withdrawal (Koob, 2020; George & Koob, 2017). Understanding these molecular pathways is crucial for developing targeted pharmacotherapies for CUD and withdrawal (Bonnet & Preuss, 2017).

## Brain Structure and Function

The subjective and behavioral effects of cannabis intoxication are a direct reflection of THC-induced alterations in the activity and connectivity of specific brain regions and neural circuits (Pearlson, 2020). Neuroimaging techniques, including structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), have provided invaluable insights into how cannabis affects the brain, both acutely during intoxication and chronically with long-term use.

### Brain Regions and Neural Circuits

The dense distribution of CB1 receptors dictates the primary brain regions affected by cannabis. Acute THC administration alters function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, amygdala, striatum, and cerebellum, which aligns with the observed clinical effects (Dervaux, 2013; Rivera-Olmos & Parra-Bernal, 2016).

*   **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC):** The PFC is central to executive functions, including decision-making, working memory, and attention (Oomen et al., 2018). Acute cannabis intoxication consistently impairs these functions (Karila et al., 2014; Ashton, 2018; Ramey & Regier, 2018). Neuroimaging studies show that THC alters PFC activity, often leading to inefficient patterns of cerebral activation during cognitive tasks, where users may need to recruit more neural resources to perform at the same level as non-users (Feinstein et al., 2015). Chronic use, especially starting in adolescence, has been linked to structural changes, including reduced volume in regions like the orbitofrontal cortex (Dodd, 2007; Dervaux, 2013).
*   **Hippocampus:** This region is critical for the formation of new episodic memories (Dodd, 2007). The profound impairment of short-term and working memory is a hallmark of acute cannabis intoxication (Hollister, 1971; Karila et al., 2014; Torres & Fiestas, 2014). This is directly related to the high density of CB1 receptors in the hippocampus and THC's suppression of synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation), a key cellular mechanism of memory formation (Araos et al., 2014). Chronic heavy use is associated with dose-dependent decreases in hippocampal gray matter volume, which may contribute to persistent memory deficits (Dervaux, 2013; Klugman & Gruzelier, 2003).
*   **Amygdala:** As a key hub for processing emotions, particularly fear and anxiety, the amygdala's function is bidirectionally modulated by cannabis (Musty, 2007). At low doses, THC can have anxiolytic effects, but at higher doses or in vulnerable individuals, it can induce anxiety, panic, and paranoia (Karila et al., 2014; Thomas, 1993). This duality is reflected in altered amygdala activity and connectivity with the PFC during intoxication (D'Souza, 2023). Chronic use has been linked to reduced amygdala volume (Dervaux, 2013).
*   **Striatum and Reward Circuitry:** The striatum, particularly the nucleus accumbens, is central to the brain's reward system. As discussed, THC increases dopamine release here, mediating euphoria and reinforcement (Roques, 2000; Beninger, 2018). Chronic use can blunt the response of this system to both drug and non-drug rewards, potentially contributing to anhedonia and amotivation (Schmits & Quertemont, 2013; D'Souza, 2023).
*   **Cerebellum:** The cerebellum is crucial for motor coordination and balance. The high concentration of CB1 receptors in this region explains the ataxia, impaired coordination, and psychomotor slowing observed during acute intoxication (Ashton, 2018; Karila et al., 2014). These effects are a major contributor to cannabis-impaired driving (Albertson et al., 2016).

### Neuroimaging Findings

**Structural Imaging:** Structural MRI studies in chronic cannabis users have yielded somewhat inconsistent results, but a general pattern has emerged, particularly in early-onset, heavy users. Findings include reduced gray matter volume in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex (Dervaux, 2013; Rivera-Olmos & Parra-Bernal, 2016). Some studies also report alterations in white matter integrity, particularly in the corpus callosum, which could affect interhemispheric communication (Dodd, 2007). These structural changes are often correlated with the duration of cannabis use and age of onset, suggesting a neurotoxic effect on the developing brain (Hyytiä, 2015; Dervaux, 2013). However, it remains a point of controversy whether these differences predate cannabis use and represent a vulnerability factor, or are a direct consequence of chronic exposure (Ashton, 2018).

**Functional Imaging:** Functional neuroimaging has been instrumental in mapping the acute effects of THC. PET studies have demonstrated changes in cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism in frontal, temporal, and limbic regions during intoxication (Dodd, 2007). fMRI studies have shown that THC alters brain activation patterns during various cognitive tasks. For example, during working memory tasks, cannabis users often show hyperactivation in prefrontal and parietal regions, suggesting a compensatory effort to maintain performance in the face of drug-induced inefficiency (Feinstein et al., 2015). Studies have also investigated resting-state functional connectivity, revealing that cannabis can disrupt communication within and between large-scale brain networks, such as the default mode network and executive control networks, which may relate to the alterations in thought and consciousness experienced during intoxication (D'Souza, 2023). These functional disruptions are particularly relevant to understanding the link between cannabis and psychosis, as similar network dysconnectivity is a core feature of schizophrenia (Potvin et al., 2004; Jockers‐Scherübl, 2006).

## Developmental Neurobiology

The impact of cannabis on the brain is not uniform across the lifespan; the developing brain is uniquely vulnerable to its effects (Hyytiä, 2015; Dervaux, 2013). Adolescence represents a critical period of neurodevelopment, characterized by significant synaptic pruning, myelination, and maturation of key brain circuits, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (Sommer & Arango, 2017). The endocannabinoid system plays a fundamental role in orchestrating these developmental processes, including neuronal migration, synapse formation, and plasticity (Araos et al., 2014; Vega-García et al., 2021). Exogenous cannabinoids like THC can disrupt this finely tuned developmental trajectory, leading to potentially lasting consequences for brain structure and function (Ashton, 2018; Hyytiä, 2015).

### Adolescence as a Critical Period of Vulnerability

A substantial body of evidence from both human and animal studies indicates that initiating cannabis use during adolescence is associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes compared to starting in adulthood (Ashton, 2018; Copeland et al., 2014; Hall, 2012). These risks include an increased likelihood of developing CUD, progressing to other illicit drug use, experiencing persistent cognitive deficits, and developing psychiatric disorders, most notably psychosis (Bulacia, 2016; Radhakrishnan et al., 2014; Zammit et al., 2011).

The neurotoxic impact of THC appears to be magnified during this period of active brain maturation (Dervaux, 2013). Chronic exposure during adolescence is linked to more pronounced structural abnormalities, such as reduced hippocampal volume and altered white matter integrity, than exposure limited to adulthood (Rivera-Olmos & Parra-Bernal, 2016). These structural changes may underlie the long-term cognitive impairments observed in early-onset users, which can persist even after prolonged abstinence (Karila et al., 2014; Klugman & Gruzelier, 2003). Deficits are most consistently found in verbal learning, memory, and attention, which can significantly impair academic achievement and occupational functioning (Hall, 2012; Taylor & Beckmann, 2021; Copeland et al., 2014).

Furthermore, the adolescent brain's reward and executive control systems are still developing, rendering young people more susceptible to the reinforcing effects of drugs and less capable of exercising impulse control (Bari et al., 2010; Winters & Ingwalson, 2022). Early cannabis use can alter the developmental trajectory of these systems, increasing the risk for addiction (George & Koob, 2017; Winters & Ingwalson, 2022).

### Cannabis Use and the Onset of Psychotic Disorders

The association between adolescent cannabis use and psychosis is one of the most robust and concerning findings in the field (Radhakrishnan et al., 2014; D'Souza, 2023). Multiple longitudinal studies have demonstrated a dose-dependent relationship: the earlier the onset and the higher the frequency of use
